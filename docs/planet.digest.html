  <p>The madness of this world became obvious in an instant. Everything is
changing way faster than most of us ever imagined — but I’m not
worried. To the contrary, I’m weirdly optimistic — because of Bitcoin,
and because of you.</p>

<p>You probably don’t know me; I probably don’t know you. And that’s
perfectly fine. However, I know some of you — and I believe that I
know some of you quite well, even if we have never met or met only
briefly. I have read your writings, watched you debate each other, saw
the things you’ve built, and listened to your voices for countless
hours. I don’t care if you identify as a bitcoiner, or as a maximalist,
or as a pre-/shit-/multi-/whatever-coiner. I don’t care if you fell down
the rabbit hole years ago or if you just got the first glimpse of the
honey badger den. I don’t care about your political beliefs, sexual
orientation, gender, religion, age, and countless other qualifiers that
might be used to put you in a box. The fact that you are here, reading
this, thinking about Bitcoin, <em>caring</em> about Bitcoin, is enough for me.
That’s why I’m bullish. Bullish on Bitcoin, and bullish on bitcoiners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bullish on bitcoiners.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/matt_odell/status/1202843544093954048?s=20">Matt Odell</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin’s implications are so far-reaching, the innovation so profound,
it boggles the mind. The inter-disciplinary nature of this beast
attracts minds from countless areas of expertise: computer science,
cryptography, mathematics, physics, economics, finance, trading,
engineering, the list goes on and on. Bright minds, extraordinary
characters, strong opinions, contrarians, idealists trying to change the
world — all those and more make up the loose collective we might call
bitcoiners.</p>

<h3 id="honey-badger-dont-care">Honey Badger Don’t Care</h3>

<p>Don’t get me wrong: Bitcoin doesn’t need you; it doesn’t need any of us.
It’s incentive systems have a way to make sure that Bitcoin will be
fine, even if the set of people working on it and using it changes
completely. It will be fine, just as it is now as the whole world grinds
to a halt.</p>

<p>The current crisis — and the financial repercussions that will
inevitably follow — will make it obvious that we need Bitcoin more
than Bitcoin needs us. Again, don’t get me wrong: we must not be
complacent. We must continue to care, continue to build, continue to
educate, continue to proselytize, continue to argue, continue to debate.
We find ourselves at the forefront of a battle of ideas, and in this
battle, complacency kills.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ask not what bitcoin can do for you, but what you can do for
 bitcoin.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944543821307707392?s=20">Adam Back</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can contribute by coding, writing, educating, discussing,
recording, creating, or simply hodling — great. But make no mistake:
Bitcoin is bigger than all of us. And, dare I say it, the current
failure of the legacy system is bigger than Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Yes, Bitcoin has the potential to fix many of the underlying issues of
our corruptible and broken systems. But we will need a plethora of
freedom-enabling technologies to win this war; tools that empower the
individual by default, by offering strong privacy guarantees,
encryption, and the freedom to use these tools without restrictions.</p>

<h3 id="shill-lightly">Shill Lightly</h3>

<p>As this global pandemic sweeps through the globe, with hundreds of
thousands infected, tens of thousands dead, and millions of people out
of a job, priorities shift from trivial to existential. While difficult,
it is more important than ever to stay humble and shill lightly. It is
all too easy to alienate friends and family by offering an enthusiastic
Bitcoin lecture every time you sit at the dinner table. While enthusiasm
is laudable, I strongly believe that Bitcoin will be understood by
everyone as soon as they are ready — be it out of necessity or out of
curiosity. Yes, the timeline just got accelerated. But this is still a
marathon, not a sprint. And it might be one of many marathons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the facts of history is that battles do not stay won. Those
 that matter have to be waged again and again.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stanley_Knowles">Stanley Knowles</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The powers that be will neither step away willingly nor silently. And
since the battle for self-sovereignty and freedom is one that matters,
it will have to be waged again and again.</p>

<h3 id="protecting-an-idea-whose-time-has-come">Protecting An Idea Whose Time Has Come</h3>

<p>Bad actors will continually try to undermine Bitcoin, as they have tried
in the past. Unfortunately, we have good reason to believe that this
will continue. And, unfortunately, we see the trend of undermining and
maiming technology everywhere we look. If we look at the internet, for
example, we see various interest groups waging war against net
neutrality, politicians introducing nation-wide firewalls, websites
geo-blocking content, people getting arbitrarily deplatformed,
demonetized, or banned.</p>

<p>They say that nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. I
believe that Bitcoin’s time has come, and in hindsight, it will be
obvious to everyone. Before it becomes obvious, however, swathes of
people will try to distort what Bitcoin is and the ideas it represents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ideas change the world, but they do it by assuming shape, they do it
 by taking concrete form.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Stanley_Knowles">Stanley Knowles</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Bitcoin’s form is quite concrete since its inception, it is an
abstract, intangible form, making it exceptionally hard to grasp. It
will take some time until Bitcoin is as ubiquitous as the internet is
now. This time — this window of confusion — will be used and abused
by lawmakers and charlatans alike. However, it is also a window of
opportunity. An opportunity to sharpen our tools, to prepare for the
flood, to ship the future faster than they can ban it.</p>

<h3 id="they-are-always-wrong">They Are Always Wrong</h3>

<p>Undoubtedly, there are plenty of people who don’t want Bitcoin to
succeed. They will do everything in their power to prolong the
inevitable. They are wed to the current system, gaining from its
inherent imbalance. Some are close to the monetary spigot, or willfully
ignorant, or enemies of freedom in general. Others are outright evil,
aiming to become the foot that stomps on your face, forever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They told us not to wish in the first place, not to aspire, not to
try; to be quiet, to play nice, to shoot low and aspire not at all.
They are always wrong. Follow your dreams. Make your wishes. Create
 the future. And above all, believe in yourself.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/J._Michael_Straczynski">Joseph Michael Straczynski</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will continue to tell us that what we are doing is a pipe dream,
that what we are aiming for is impossible, that we can’t operate outside
of the current systems. They will restrict our freedoms: our freedom to
transact, our freedom to save, our freedom to remain private. They will
tell us that certain kinds of mathematics and software are illegal. They
will continue to justify mass surveillance by trying to sell us the
illusion of safety. And they will continue to be wrong.</p>

<p>Speak up. Be outraged. Use alternatives. Build alternatives. Don’t
settle for the status quo — we can do better. Bitcoin is what we make
of it, and I can’t imagine a better set of people to realize the full
potential of this grand idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is nothing better to be on a shared mission with extraordinary
people who can be radically truthful, and radically transparent with
 each other.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://youtu.be/J2Qrm9UB7qY?t=154">Ray Dalio</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stay vigilant. Stay radical. Stay true to yourself. As the world is
grinding to a halt, and the fall of Rome becomes more likely than ever,
strong characters, sound principles, and truthful conduct are
imperative.</p>

<p>The stage is set, the drama is unfolding, and as the crescendo comes we
must not give in to tyranny. The path will be twisted and bumpy, and I’m
honored to walk it to the end, with you on my side. We got this.</p>

<p>This is the famous opening statement of <a href="https://pdflibrary.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/schmitt_polittheology.pdf">Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty</a> published by Carl Schmitt in 1922. This statement offers the fundamental axiom of how all sovereign power functions, and how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_exception">sovereign exception</a> found in emergency legal decrees allows for any sovereign to overcome and dispose of the law. In the essay <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-political-theology-of-crypto/">the political theology of crypto</a> I explain how cryptography negates the possibility of the sovereign exception through the banishment physical and identifying power, which thereby erodes all forms of contemporary state and legal power. I have also wrote an essay on how the metaphysical tensions between <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-sovereign-the-subject-and-crypto-power/">any sovereign and any subject</a> will always result in a power dynamic that where the sovereign decision will always over come any law in times of sincere crisis or emergency, and how cryptography negates this form of power. In this essay I would like to expound more deeply upon the explicit theology of bitcoin, its formula of power, and what it means for the fate of humanity in these darkest of times.</p>



<h3>Bitcoin as Subjectivity</h3>



<p>While bitcoin is <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/crypto-truth-power/">inherently an object of war</a>, it is also an object of art. Art because it is only an expression&#8211;an object of non-tangibility, and subjective individual human values according the society we live within. However, through a Hegelian synthesis of art and war; bitcoin spills out from the noosphere as a damnation of all fiat currencies of the world of flesh and steel, and the redemptive answer we seek to rescue and restore law, economy, and order from these crises forced upon them. Through the power of cryptography, and the systems of truth that it demands; Bitcoin expresses a form of truth that no human, institution, or organization is any longer capable of anywhere the physical realm or legal jurisdictions. </p>



<p>This artistic power of war that bitcoin harnesses comes from a totalizing deterritorialization and reterritorialization (in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze">Deleuzian</a> sense of the word) of the global order through the initiation of a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_immanence">plane of immanence</a> based upon cryptographic power. This plane of immanence is the renewal of a <em>nomos</em> (law, customs, or social cohesion) of humanity with the internet at its organizational core, and truth as the form of legitimacy. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novus_ordo_seclorum">novus ordo seclorum</a> where truth, not authority, becomes the renewed source of legitimacy for all people everywhere. Through the exchange of the legitimacy of power through the sacrifice of authoritarian decrees for the truth of what is, bitcoin inverts the sovereign formula of power. </p>



<p>Both Schmitt and Agamben, two of the leading scholars on the philosophy of sovereignty, define sovereignty as a boarderline concept that is traced throughout the theory of the state. Both conclude that sovereignty finds its foundation in the authentic decision that IS the sovereign exception of the law (also know as &#8216;a state of emergency&#8217; or &#8216;sovereign crisis&#8217;), not the norm. Schmitt surmises this as, <em>&#8220;&#8216;All law is situational law.&#8217; The sovereign produces and guarantees the situation in its totality. He has the monopoly over this last decision.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This is of great importance because it is through the sovereign exception found in emergency decrees all state law is doomed to the fascism inherent to it. There is no bearing or trace of truth in the sovereign exception; only the raw authoritative power that will justify any legal exceptions. The great father of the theory of the state himself, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a> surmised this in Leviathan rather flippantly as;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>&#8220;Auctoritas, non veritas facit legem (authority, not truth makes legitimacy)&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Schmitt, whom is among the most esteemed of legal scholars on Hobbes and his theory of the state, further surmises this point of how authority functions within the sovereign exception:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;The exception, which is not codified in the existing legal order, can at best be described as a case of extreme peril, a danger to the existence of the state&#8230; It is truly a matter of extreme emergency and how the emergency can be eliminated&#8230; From the liberal constitutional point of view, there would be no judicial competence at all. The most guidance the constitution can provide is to indicate who can act in such a case&#8230; He [the sovereign] decides if there is an extreme emergency as well as what must be done to eliminate it. Although he stands outside of the normally legally valid system, he nevertheless belongs to it, for it is he who must decide weather the constitution needs to be suspended in its entirety&#8230; Whether one has confidence and hope it can be eliminated depends on philosophical, especially on philosophical-historical or metaphysical convictions.&#8221;</p><cite>Carl Schmitt, Political Theology p. 7</cite></blockquote>



<h3>Bitcoin as Philosophical Conviction</h3>



<p>Bitcoin is the philosophical cognition of a world that has lost its nomos, where truth no longer a fact, but an opinion of power. Only in a world where seditious guile rules opening, where money is but a tool for the politically powerful, does bitcoin present its radical antithesis to the current paradigm of law, order, and sovereignty. It is the fulfillment of a crypto-anarchist critique of state, money, and legal power. </p>



<p>It is this philosophical conviction&#8211;particular the philosophical-historical  cognition of what cryptography is, how it was developed for total war, and what its development throughout the concourse of human history means; that we find a categorical imperative from which the sovereign exception can be totally and completely eliminated. Through the linguistic form that <em>is</em> cryptography; a demand is created that can only be answered in binary form of &#8216;yes, yes,&#8217; or &#8216;no, no,&#8217; and nothing else. It is a formula of true / false statements of output ownership protected by the magnanimity of cryptography, which creates the timechain of bitcoin, and the fulfillment of bitcoin&#8217;s oath to the cryptography that concretes it. </p>



<p>The sovereign legal form glitches out before naked truth and the total silent obligation that is the secret of all state power, <em>arcana imperii</em>: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them. For the right men have by nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by no covenant be relinquished.”</em></p><cite><em>-Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>A world that has lost its <em>nomos</em> is a world where no sovereign power, institution, or government can offer even the most basic protections or assurances that comprises of the dignity of life. While the law is suppose to be the fulfillment of the most basic promise of the social contract by the sovereign, we have entered into a territory where no such promise exist. The law today is little more than authoritarian approvals, appeals, rules, and decrees; lacking even the most basic contractual functions. Through the broken oaths of sovereign powers everywhere towards the most basic aspects of the social contract; all people everywhere have been forsaken, the truth of their laws and their justice corrupted in every way.  </p>



<p>In this darkest of nights however, there is a spectacular gem of truth from which light gleams and points towards our exit from this hollowed and damned place. Bitcoin and the cryptographic breakthroughs that it has ushered in over the last decade offers us a totally new and novel strategy of human organization that breaks out of the sovereign form and can restore law, order, and economy to their rightful places. As Foucault warned us, <em>&#8220;In political and social theory, we still have not cut off the king&#8217;s head.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Bitcoin and cryptography is a form of power that is beyond any physical force and the brutishness of any form of authoritarianism for the very real truth it must contain in order to function, and the very real protection that the cryptography it contains offers. Bitcoin is the premonition of an idea whose time has come; of a humanity that is ready to rise to its task of the abrogation of the statism, and to restore the political to its rightful place at the forefront of any law. </p>



<p>Bitcoin is a new form of political, economic, and moral organization that raises truth to being the only sacrosanct of any law. It is the philosophical cognition of a world that understands the insipid greed of men, and the infinite vice that is power. Bitcoin has enables a new form of digital organization that banishes the prattling lies of men, and demands the proof of any claim. Bitcoin does this through returning truth to its preeminent place as the foundation of all social contracts, and the meaning of truth in such agreements through the cryptographic formula of verification. </p>



<h3>Bitcoin as Political Theology </h3>



<p>At the very end of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Political Theology</span>, Schmitt of all people, provides us with an anarchist&#8217;s critique of any sovereign decision by the very virtue of what any decision by a sovereign power must be and how it is decided:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Every claim of decision must be evil for the anarchist, because the right emerges by itself if the immanence of life is not disturbed by such claims. This radical antithesis forces him of course to decide against the decision; and this results in the odd paradox where Bakuin, the greatest anarchist of the nineteenth century, had to become in theory the theologian of the antitheological, and in practice the dictator of an antidictatorship.&#8221; </p><cite>Carl Schmitt, the final paragraph of Political Theology</cite></blockquote>



<p>It is this radical antithesis that has us also decide against the decision as well. We are products of the late 20th century; grandchildren of the spectacle society where all forms of life that would not be subjected to the machine were liquidated long ago. Now under the grimace of the total corruption of law, the complete looting of the treasuries of all peoples by political and corporate oligarchies everywhere from &#8217;emergencies&#8217; of their own creation; we find the reason for us to rise against, and choose to reclaim that which is only ours. This the reactivation of the political as the struggle for life, and the right to die trying; opens the truly political (polis) once again. </p>



<p>We understand how Bitcoin makes for the oddest of paradoxes; with anarchism becoming in theory the greatest form of &#8216;capitalism&#8217; against all states, and in practice, a dictatorship of privacy and pseudonymity which unrelentingly will not give itself to anyone but the individual. </p>



<p>Bitcoin rings with a thunderous crack, “Vires In Numeris” and becomes more powerful and fervent with each seeker that we convert. It is a political theology that restores truth as the final weapon against a system of lies, fear, and exploitation to renew the nomos of humanity, and for us all to discover that there is still a political to be claimed, but only for those who are willing to take the risk. </p>



<h3>The Revolutionary Truth Hidden in Bitcoin</h3>



<p>Having witnessed the twilight of humanity befall idiotic and empty slogans under the barbarism of statism&#8217;s vacant chanting of idiotic lies; the spectacle has envelopes all. In all of its grandeur of stupidity and lobotomization, state capitalism has fused with the totalitarian eye of the internet; idiotically  unaware of the beast it was unleashing, the prophecy it was fulfilling. </p>



<p>From the very outset, we can see the fundamental contradiction between the idea of sovereignty and the functions of cryptography. Cryptography is completely unanswerable to any sovereign power, as it lack the capacity to understand anything beyond its binary language of true or false, nor does it capitulate to any form of violence. The only laws that cryptography understands are the laws of mathematics which animates their functions.</p>



<p>By the very nature that no sovereign power can overcome the laws of mathematics that animate cryptographic systems, it points to <a href="https://paywall.link/t/b55e54">the very nature of what crypto is and its hidden encrypted meaning</a>. There is no emergency, war, pandemic or crisis that can stop bitcoin. Now there is only the real state of emergency to be introduced, and the final struggle in which we take our rightful place as the owner of ourselves, our political systems, and our wealth for those whom we hodl in common. </p>



<p>This is the political theology of Bitcoin, the radial promise of a machine of truth that can only speak in a binary of true or false, documenting its own claims of just that. From the outset of the creation of the timechain of Satoshi&#8217;s; Bitcoin has been nothing more than a mechanization of truth-telling of what address owns what bitcoin, and how many joules of energy were used to produce those bitcoins. </p>



<p>With each block that is built on the bitcoin timechain, it resounds and echos louder and louder against the backdrop of man and his fallen world of lies, deception, and deceit. Only in a time where man has become an insipid beast of guile and sophistry, where politicians and gangsters openly fraternize and discuss how to rape the world with no consequence to themselves, does the theology of bitcoin and the promise it cointains move from <a href="https://paywall.link/t/41c89d">revolutionary to messianic</a>. </p>



<p>There is no long any government anywhere that can offer the same promise as that of Bitcoin does. There is no central bank, no commodity form, no currency, no &#8216;<a href="https://paywall.link/t/b55e54">crypto</a>&#8216; outside of bitcoin that can offer the same assurances or security as bitcoin. The theological promise of bitcoin is that there will never be more than 21 million coins, and that there is no way to alter the supply schedule, or know exactly who owns what outputs. It is a new social contract based upon the inverted form of the sovereign dictum, with truth&#8211;not authority&#8211;being the legitimate maker of the law that is bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain.  </p>



<p>In a world where governments across the globe have promised to create infinite monetary units, swore everlasting loyalty to corporations and melomaniacs before their own citizens; the only thing left to do is refuse their broken social contract they call law, and create new ones better and more fitting for our times. Through the power, glory, and grace that is bitcoin, and for the magnanimous promise that Satoshi Nakamoto has delivered to us; bitcoin is the theological answer to the crises of our time. Its heliotropism directs us towards a world where we use cryptographic systems to verify the truth of all things, and utilize such a power to renew and recreate our systems of liberty and justice for all.</p>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s promise of a money that does not change for the light and transient causes of mortals, nor bend to the callous and pathetic will of politicians around the planet has given us a light to follow in these darkest of times. It is <a href="https://paywall.link/t/ed0ed9">the oath of the cryptographic machine to itself</a>, and its total intransigence to change for any crisis, emergency, or state of exception. Though this most wonderful and theological of tasks, Satoshi Nakamoto has created the machine of economic redemption that we need to renew our world, to free ourselves from the chains of debt and bondage that governments around the globe have forced on to all of us. It is a method to renew the social contract to its original form, and what the promise of a social contract under the rubric of truth really means.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Every man having been born free and master of himself, no one else may under any pretext whatever subject him without his consent.&#8221;</p><cite>&#8211;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract, 1762</cite></blockquote>

  <p>The world you know and love is no more, even if it isn’t obvious to
every one of you just yet. We will look back at this moment in time, the
months we are currently living through, the weeks that will mark the
line between the pre-virus and the post-virus world. One thing is clear:
we are past the inflection point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when
decades happen.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin#Misattributed">Vladimir Lenin</a>*</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the events around the COVID-19 pandemic unfold, the fragility of our
global systems becomes painfully obvious. This health crisis is
triggering a financial one, and if we don’t get our act together, things
will go from bad to worse.</p>

<h3 id="the-legacy-system-is-crumbling">The Legacy System is Crumbling</h3>

<p>Both our money and our financial system has fundamental issues. Ruled
from the top down by unelected decision-makers, these structures are not
equipped to handle complex problems. Even worse, trying to fix a complex
system by heavily interfering with natural processes will turn an
annoying mosquito problem into a deadly snake problem (with some frogs
in-between).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move
to higher levels.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140622171150/http://www.turnthetide.info/id54.htm">Albert Einstein</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization is efficient until it isn’t. I’m afraid that most of us
are going to learn this lesson the hard way: one by one, central points
of failure will crumble under the pressure of current world events, and
all we can do is watch our fragile legacy systems collapse (or turn into
Orwellian nightmares).</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting that all “old” systems are obsolete — they aren’t.
I’m suggesting that we are transitioning to a post-virus world, and it
will be impossible to understand what is going on — and how problems
might be solved — if you aren’t equipped to understand and use the
tools of this new era.</p>

<h3 id="a-new-type-of-thinking">A New Type of Thinking</h3>

<p>The tools of the post-virus world need to be transparent, open, and
freedom-enabling. Gatekeepers, censors, and arbitrary restrictions won’t
help us to solve the problems we are facing — they will only make
things worse. Information wants to be free, and we will need all the
information out in the open to fight the battles yet to come.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you what kind of tools will emerge. Instead, let me list
some things that are both of the utmost importance and difficult to
understand/accept if you come from the legacy world:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://bitcoin-resources.com">bitcoin</a></li>
  <li>the internet</li>
  <li>social media</li>
  <li>citizen journalism</li>
  <li>memes and misinformation</li>
  <li>open-source and free (libre) software</li>
</ul>

<p>Others aren’t as hard to understand, but equally important: encryption,
open hardware, biohacking, DIY biology, 3d printing, and other forms of
distributed manufacturing.</p>

<p>These tools and the new type of thinking that comes along with them will
lead to different structures, a different way of doing things, different
outcomes. It might seem strange and inefficient at times, and that’s
okay. The important part is that we move away from fragile systems and
central points of failure, building robust, and even anti-fragile
systems for generations to come.</p>

<h3 id="fragile-robust-and-anti-fragile-systems">Fragile, Robust, and Anti-Fragile Systems</h3>

<p>The world is a scary, complicated, and chaotic place. Our
interconnectedness and interdependence have drastic and unforeseen
consequences, as the current pandemic shows so clearly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Someone ate a bat in China and now you don’t get to retire. Funny how
 the world works.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://twitter.com/jebus911/status/1237092755622502406?s=20">Jeremy Ross</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many systems got centralized over time, moving from robustness to
fragility: the global financial system, various supply chains, large
parts of our media apparatus, and even the money we use daily.</p>

<p>Complex, large-scale problems require <a href="/2019/08/07/proof-of-life/">organic</a>, bottom-up, emergent
solutions. We, as a society, need to make sure that robust solutions can
emerge, which implies that we need to protect personal liberties and
encourage personal responsibility more than ever.</p>

<p>It would be great if a benevolent ruler could step in and solve all our
problems. Unfortunately, every benevolent ruler transforms into a
totalitarian dictator given enough time. And I hope we can all agree
that we don’t need any more of those.</p>

<p>I would love to end on an optimistic note, but the future ahead will be
dark and bumpy, especially if the legacy world is all you know.</p>

<!--
   note: content goes first; than try summary
 -->

  <p>As I have <a href="/2019/08/07/proof-of-life/">argued previously</a>, Bitcoin is a living organism. But
where does this organism live, exactly? As with many questions in the world of
Bitcoin, exact answers are hard to come by. Living things have fuzzy edges:
beginnings and endings are hard to pin-point, differentiation is more-or-less
arbitrary, and what was classified as a wolf today might evolve to be a dog
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has no rigid specification, no absolute finality, no fixed development
team, no final security guarantees, no scheduled updates, no central brain, no
central vision, no kings, and no rulers. It is a <em>decentralized</em> organism,
organically evolving without central planners. The lack of any centralization is
the source of Bitcoin’s beauty, it’s organic behavior, and it’s resilience.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is <a href="https://21lessons.com/3/">everywhere and nowhere</a>, which makes
figuring out where this thing lives a daunting task. However, it turns out that
there is a space it lives in. Multiple spaces, as we shall see.</p>

<h3 id="the-habitats-of-bitcoin">The Habitats of Bitcoin</h3>

<p>While classifying the habitat of a decentralized organism isn’t trivial, we can
look at the constituents of Bitcoin to make the task a bit easier. As outlined
in the <a href="/2019/08/07/proof-of-life/">last article of this series</a>, Bitcoin lives across
domains, with one foot in the purely informational realm (ideas and code) and
one foot in the physical realm (people and nodes).</p>

<figure>

  <img src="https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2020-03-01-bitcoin-s-habitats/cyberspace-meatspace.png" />


</figure>

<p>An awareness of Bitcoin’s environment(s) might help to better understand this
new form of life. No organism can be meaningfully studied in isolation, and
Bitcoin is no exception. As Alan Watts pointed out, one has to be aware of the
basic unity every organism forms with its environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For the ecologist, the biologist, and the physicist know (but seldom
feel) that every organism constitutes a single field of behavior, or
process, with its environment. There is no way of separating what any
given organism is doing from what its environment is doing, for which
reason ecologists speak not of organisms in environments but of
organism-environments.”</p>

  <p><cite>Alan Watts</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at the organism-environment(s) we
are dealing with. As outlined above, Bitcoin’s ideas and code inhabit one realm,
and Bitcoin’s people and nodes inhabit another. To stick with tradition, let’s
call the physical realm “<strong>meatspace</strong>” and the purely informational realm
“<strong>cyberspace</strong>” — even if, as always, the lines might be fuzzy around the
edges.</p>

<p>The “soul” of Bitcoin, so to speak, lives in <strong>cyberspace</strong>. There, Bitcoin
absorbs useful ideas and incorporates them into its code. As with all living
things, something is <em>useful</em> if it helps an organism to survive. While Bitcoin
has various self-regulatory mechanisms to react to the environment, new ideas
may be necessary for survival if changes are drastic enough.</p>

<p>The “body” of Bitcoin, like all bodies, is living in <strong>meatspace</strong>. Nodes, hard
drives, cables, and other things come together in an intricate dance, pushing
around electrons, changing zeros to ones and vice-versa, making sure that
Bitcoin’s heart beats about a thousand times a week.</p>

<p>Living things have an interest in staying alive, and the Bitcoin organism is no
exception. Bitcoin found an ingenious way to ensure that it stays alive: it pays
people, as Ralph Merkle pointed out. People — and increasingly, organizations
— are incentivized to keep it alive. They shape the physical world to
Bitcoin’s liking, feed it energy, renew its hardware, and update its software to
keep it alive.</p>

<p>The fact that Bitcoin pays us to keep it alive opens up a third space: a space
of financial transactions, value, and mutual beneficial exchange. Let’s call
this space “<strong>finspace.</strong>”</p>

<p>To understand finspace, we will have to examine the other side of this coin. So
far, we only examined the side with an uppercase B: the Bitcoin network. But
there is also bitcoin — with a lowercase b — which is the unit of value
itself, brought into existence by every copy of the ledger.</p>

<p>These bitcoins, while deeply embedded in the amber of the ledger, are traded
worldwide on various markets and marketplaces. And since these bitcoins — and
their value — are critical for Bitcoin’s survival, we will have to recognize
finspace as the third space this strange beast lives in. Note that finspace,
strangely enough, is solely inhabited by bitcoin with a lowercase b.</p>

<p>In total, we can identify three distinct environments which the Bitcoin organism
inhabits:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cyberspace</strong>: the world of ideas and code.</li>
  <li><strong>Meatspace</strong>: the world of people and nodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Finspace</strong>: the world of value and markets; the world of dollars and sats.</li>
</ul>

<figure>

  <img src="https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2020-03-01-bitcoin-s-habitats/venn-diagram-cyber-meat-fin.png" />


</figure>

<p>Understanding these habitats becomes increasingly important, especially as the
climate in one — or more — heats up.</p>

<h3 id="the-climates-they-are-a-changin">The Climates They Are A-Changin’</h3>

<p>The three spaces outlined above — cyberspace, meatspace, and finspace — have
different restrictions; different climates, so to speak. In short: they operate
under different rules. Once these rules change drastically enough, people will
say that “the political climate is heating up” and reports on “the coming
financial climate” will be written. Citizens will be unable to speak and act
freely. If things change drastically enough, people will rise up in protest, or,
if all else fails, flee.</p>

<p><strong>Cyberspace:</strong> While we don’t have precise words for it, it is obvious
that the climate in cyberspace has changed quite drastically in the last
two decades or so. The idealistic, utopian ideas which were the
foundation of most of the internet were perverted by the
advertisement-driven surveillance companies which are the giants of
today.</p>

<p>People and politicians are slowly waking up to the strange reality we are living
in: the fact that Facebook can <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/">manipulate moods</a> and sway elections is as
disturbing as the fact that Google knows you better than you know yourself.
Edward Snowden showed that the most paranoid netizens were right all along:
everyone in cyberspace is under constant surveillance, without suspicion, by
default.</p>

<p>While the western world does not immediately <em>feel</em> the repercussions
that come with living in a constant state of surveillance, Chinese
citizens are gathering first-hand experience with each passing day.</p>

<p>In the western world, the consequences are advertisements which range from
annoying to spooky. In China, the consequences are frozen bank accounts, an
inability to buy train or plane tickets, elimination of creditworthiness,
automated fines for trivial offenses, and more. Voicing the “wrong” opinion —
online or not — can lead to restricted access to schools, hotels, and jobs.
And after ruining your life with the flip of a bit you will be publicly named as
a bad citizen and the government will <a href="https://www.businessinsider.nl/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4/">take away your dog</a>. If that doesn’t
sound dystopian enough for your taste I bet that it will be in a couple of
years. Remind yourself that this is only the beginning.</p>

<p>In the “free” world, things are more subtle. Multiple efforts are underway to
curb net neutrality, the very cornerstone of the internet. Legislation is being
passed which is inherently incompatible with the laws of cyberspace. It seems
like the last battle of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars">Crypto
Wars</a> is yet to be fought as
politicians are calling for “responsible encryption” and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Distributed#Legal_challenges">ban of certain CAD
files</a>.
Companies are in charge of the speaker’s corners of cyberspace and are making
arbitrary decisions on what can be uttered by whom and what is off-limits.</p>

<p>Bitcoin knows no borders, no jurisdictions. However, it has to conform
to the laws of cyberspace — and if these laws change, e.g. if large
parts of the world block Bitcoin traffic and/or the usage of TOR, the
Bitcoin organism will have to adapt.</p>

<p><strong>Meatspace:</strong> Meatspace climate differs wildly from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. Some bastions of freedom still exist, but once you try to
board an international flight it becomes obvious that your right to
privacy and your freedom to bring a bottle of water with you are null
and void.</p>

<p>Protests across the globe indicate that the powerless are fed up with
the powerful, who do everything they can to stay in control and solidify
their positions of influence.</p>

<p>History shows that governments do not shy away from using their power. In 1933,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102">Executive Order 6102</a> was
signed, effectively forcing the whole population of the United States to hand
over their gold and gold certificates to the government.</p>

<figure>

  <img src="https://dergigi.com/assets/images/bitcoin/2020-03-01-bitcoin-s-habitats/executive-order-6102.jpg" />


</figure>

<p>Yes, seizing bitcoin is way harder than seizing gold — in some cases
even impossible. But it would surprise me if those who currently control
our money — the governments and central banks of this world — would
simply roll over and let Bitcoin march on unhindered. Governments have a
monopoly on violence, and they are able and willing to abuse this
violence in their own interest.</p>

<p>With Bitcoin, however, people can flee a country with their wealth
intact. While this is definitely not easy, and not something I would
wish on anyone, it is now possible.</p>

<p><strong>Finspace:</strong> Where should I even begin? The current, debt-based
financial system has an appetite for printing money which is beyond
belief. Quantitative Easing (QE), Negative Interest Rate Policies
(NIRPs), currency wars, hyperinflations, and a looming recession are
just a few of the recipes of the global instability soup which is
currently brewing.</p>

<p>The current financial system seems so far removed from common sense and
reality, that all the jargon in the world won’t be able to stabilize
this house of cards. People know that our money is broken, which is why
they flee to buying real estate, stocks, and all kinds of complicated
financial constructs to preserve their wealth. In the current system,
you have to be an investment expert just to hold your value.</p>

<p>And we haven’t even talked about the looming recession, and the virtual
inevitability of the next financial crisis yet. Yes, governments might
be able to kick the can down the road by printing ever more money. But
no road is endless, and the experiment which is <a href="https://21lessons.com/12/">fiat
money</a> will come to an end, one way or the
other.</p>

<p>How bitcoin will react to a catastrophe in finspace is anyone’s guess.
Some people might flee from their failing fiat currency into bitcoin,
using it as a risk-off asset. Others might sell bitcoin to buy something
they consider more stable, such as real estate or land. A rising number
of people will identify bitcoin as the best money we ever had, shunning
other assets and other monies on the quest to stack as many sats as they
can.</p>

<p>However it might play out, Bitcoin is the cure for many of the current
system’s ills. It is hard money which doesn’t devalue over time. It is
an incorruptible system which forms the basis of a new financial
reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It can’t be changed. It can’t be argued with. It can’t be tampered
with. It can’t be corrupted. It can’t be stopped. It can’t even be
interrupted.”</p>

  <p><cite><a href="https://alcor.org/cryonics/Cryonics2016-4.pdf#page=28">Ralph Merkle</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the above, it seems to have many indirect effects. It
lowers the time preference of those who use it. It incentives users to
have better personal and operational security. It incentives individuals
and companies to have better digital hygiene. It propels the development
of chip manufacturing and encryption technology.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin definitely influences its environments and vice-versa, how
Bitcoin reacts to drastic changes is yet to be seen.</p>

<h3 id="migration">Migration</h3>

<p>Bitcoin lives on the internet, as Ralph Merkle points out. The internet,
however, is not a necessary requirement for Bitcoin to work. <a href="https://21lessons.com/6">Bitcoin is
text</a>
— pure information — and every system capable of transmitting (and
storing) information is a potential habitat for the Bitcoin organism.
The internet just happens to be the most suitable habitat which
currently exists, since it is the most efficient system to transmit
information we have to date.</p>

<p><strong>Cyberspace:</strong> The Bitcoin organism <em>could</em> migrate to other
environments, and multiple efforts are underway which enable Bitcoin to spread
to places where access to Internet infrastructure is limited or non-existent. As
of this writing, Bitcoin transactions (and <a href="https://twitter.com/nvk/status/1101548727460741120?s=20">LN invoices</a>) have been sent via
<a href="https://twitter.com/nvk/status/1095354354289135617?s=20">radio waves</a>, <a href="https://txtenna.com/">mesh</a>, and <a href="https://blockstream.com/satellite/">satellite networks</a> — just to name a few. All
of these can be seen as Bitcoin conservation efforts, so to speak.</p>

<p>Whether we will see the migration of Bitcoin to another system in the
decades and centuries to come depends, in essence, on whether the
internet will remain a suitable habitat or not. If the online climate
changes drastically enough, we might see the migration to even more
resilient, less restrictive environments.</p>

<p><strong>Meatspace:</strong> We can already see that mining facilities pop up where
energy is cheapest or even stranded. In essence, mining is done where it
makes the most sense — economically speaking. The same is true for
running nodes. If people can run nodes at low risk and near zero
marginal cost, they will. Thus, visualizing Bitcoin on a map, nodes and
mining facilities migrate geographically from unfriendly places to
friendlier places over time. Unprofitable mining facilities will shut
down, profitable mining facilities will go online. The same, again, is
true for nodes.</p>

<p>Increasingly, people will migrate to jurisdictions which are more
favorable to their bitcoin holdings. And if you want to start a Bitcoin
company, you might also move to a jurisdiction which is more favorable
to you and your future business.</p>

<p><strong>Finspace:</strong> In the last 10 years, many people decided to buy bitcoin,
effectively feeding the Bitcoin organism by investing in it. This
capital allocation will continue as more people understand the nature of
this beast, and the ultimate goal of Bitcoin: the separation of money
and state.</p>

<p>What investors describe as portfolio balancing and allocation of capital can be
seen as a migration of value from worse assets to better assets; from bad stores
of value to better stores of value. Bitcoin, being the ultimate asset in terms
of portability, verifiability, divisibility, scarcity, and unseizability, <a href="/2019/05/01/bitcoins-gravity/">will
continue to suck up value</a> and grow in the process.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Bitcoin lives at the intersection of three spaces: <em>meatspace</em>, <em>cyberspace</em>,
and <em>finspace</em>. These spaces have different laws, different rules, and different
climates. To fully understand any organism, we must not only look at the
organism itself, but examine the organism-environment holistically.</p>

<p>Because of its decentralized nature, Bitcoin is able to overcome many, if not
all obstacles in its environments. It can migrate to favorable jurisdictions in
meatspace, use different transportation and storage media in cyberspace, and
feed on the instability of other asset classes in finspace.</p>

<p>Whatever the future may bring, Bitcoin is equipped to survive and thrive in the
various environments it lives in. It is remarkably resilient — well adapted to
survive any coming storm, however perfect it may be.</p>

  <p><a href="https://medium.com/@breedlove22/an-open-letter-to-ray-dalio-re-bitcoin-4b07c52a1a98"><em>In this epic piece, Robert Breedlove takes a massive dive into Bitcoin, and presents one of the most solid cases for Bitcoin that’s out there.</em></a></p><p><em>That said, it’s not always easy to get the very busy (and skeptical) Ray Dalio’s of the world to sit down for a few hours, so I hope this cover letter can encourage him to have an open mind, and give Bitcoin a few hours of his time. ROI on those few hours could be bigger than any return he’s witnessed in his highly illustrious and successful career.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*3O4hBY1dPS5XfXNQKLZe-Q.png" /></figure><p>Bitcoin is most definitely not an “easy get”. Most ultra-bullish Bitcoiners only become that way due to a deep understanding of the history and properties of money-as-we-know-it, the technology behind Bitcoin, macro, micro and behavioural economics, as well as the dynamics of start-up companies and technologies in bootstrapping themselves and realising network effects. Less technical people observe the IQ density of the space, through its industry leaders and broader development community, which allows for a high level of believability-weighted decision making. I believe you have one of the best grasps of these concepts in the world, so I ask that you humour me for a few minutes to allow me to demonstrate just how much Bitcoin aligns with your personal views and fundamentals. This journey isn’t quick — the most dedicated Bitcoiners have put in thousands of hours of research and knowledge development, as well as many hundreds of days “in the saddle” with exposure to the whims of the Bitcoin Rollercoaster. I hope that by the end of this letter you will at least consider revisiting the topic of Bitcoin with a bit more depth.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@hassmccook/bitcoin-as-a-startup-769c387c97ca">Bitcoin has been likened by some to be reflective of a startup organisation; currently heading into its Series B fund raise.</a> Bitcoin is a well-oiled “un-organization” with founders but no CEOs, many volunteers but no employees, where the best ideas are developed and implemented by consensus regardless of who proposed the idea, and provably non-diluting equity available to anyone who is willing to trade their energy for it. This is all baked into the code, and it is radically transparent for anyone wishing to participate in the ecosystem. So transparent, that an individual can verify anything they need to about the Bitcoin network by simply running some software on a very basic computer setup in the order of $200 and with the most basic of internet connections. It may likely be one of the best real-life examples of an Idea Meritocracy at play — the cultural paradigm that you originated at Bridgewater.</p><p>Idea Meritocracies are microcosms of what a “truly free” market should be. There aren’t many, if any, examples of free markets in the wild; except of course, Bitcoin. The competition in the Bitcoin space is merciless, where the best products having a shelf-life of months before being made redundant by superior products. Most industry leading service providers will find themselves competing with a free product not long after establishing themselves. As at date of writing, the Bitcoin space even meets several criteria of the “theoretical” perfectly competitive market. Bitcoin’s nature as an open-source, public, encrypted, distributed ledger means that the blockchain guarantees radical transparency, property rights and homogeneity of product, at zero or near-zero transaction and storage cost. The factors of production (labour, equipment, and capital) are mobile to the extent that only a communication link and a power source is required to participate in the ecosystem. Developing on top of Bitcoin requires no permission, and if entrepreneurs have a good enough idea, securing start-up capital is not a difficult barrier to entry to overcome. Information asymmetry, low number of market participants, and externalities from use of non-renewable energy to mine will all be resolved in time, most likely by the end of this decade. The critical thing to note is, although there are relatively few people who own the majority of Bitcoin now, once Bitcoin is spent in the future during the redistribution phase, it is spent forever — there are no reprints. If you want your Bitcoin balance to stay the same or increase, you must be creating value for someone. There is no free lunch with Bitcoin.</p><p>A central tenet of your school of thought is open-mindedness, and I encourage you to suspend disbelief and allow yourself to be immersed in high quality Bitcoin content; whether through attending a Bitcoin-only conference, books, podcasts, or even attending your local casual Bitcoin meetup. When meeting Bitcoiners in the real world, you are guaranteed to witness more IQ packed into one small place than you have ever witnessed in your life. Bitcoin was created and fostered by the most radically open-minded, and the development of its technology over time was only possible through radical open-mindedness in the developer community, and of the wider user community once improvements were thoroughly scrutinised and ready to be implemented.</p><p>I’m sure that a lot of these arguments have hit home — after all, you personally coined the majority of the arguments I used to present The Case for Bitcoin. It is daunting and confusing to step into such a revolutionary realm, but you will find that if you are willing to radically open your mind, your fundamentals are 100% aligned with Bitcoin’s.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=8951810964e4" width="1" height="1">

  <h3 class="has-text-align-center">Adapting Schmitt&#8217;s Theory of the Partisan for Digital Space</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;The terrible transformation of the world, which has been accomplished by the headlong expansion of power, lies in that things beyond the measure of our physically given sense of perception have been made visible, audible, perceptible; perceptible and thus capable of possession.  The new concept of ownership, or much more: the domination of the functions; <em>cuius regio, eius economia</em> [Whose realm, his economics], is now <em>cuius economia, eius regio</em> [Whose economics, his realm]. The new Nomos [law, custom, or social fabric] of the earth; no more Nomos.&#8221;  </p><cite>&#8211;Carl Schmitt, Glossarium, 1947</cite></blockquote>



<p>To expand upon the hypothesis that <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/crypto-truth-power/">bitcoin and crypto assets are explicit military assets of war</a>, I would like to extend my analysis into the new topographical space that is the internet and how war will be conducted in this space through the lens of Carl Schmitt&#8217;s <a href="http://users.clas.ufl.edu/burt/spaceshotsairheads/carlschmitttheoryofthepartisan.pdf">Theory of the Partisan</a> (ToP). </p>



<p>This shall be part of a larger series attempting to marry the theories of sovereignty of Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin, Giorgio Agamben to <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/cryptosovereignty/">cryptosovereignty</a>. Through taking Schmitt&#8217;s work (as I have done before with <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-political-theology-of-crypto/">Political Theology</a>) and applying these ideas towards Bitcoin specifically and <a href="https://paywall.link/t/b55e54">crypto</a> on a whole, we will have a much better understanding of cryptography&#8217;s relationship to war. Through analyzing Bitcoin as a preeminent tool of war, and how anyone may use this power to become a &#8216;crypto-partisan&#8217;, we start to unveil the radical power hidden at the heart of Bitcoin. It is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme">episteme</a> of cryptography in the digital age; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome_(philosophy)">rhizome</a> which allows for the deterritorialization and remapping of the global (and eventually cosmic space) along new territorial lines that will renewed the nomos of humanity. </p>



<p>Through extending ToP to the digital age, and by understanding crypto as first and foremost as a technology of asymmetrical defensive warfare, we can see the new topographical lines that the internet opens to warfare. By understanding cryptography as the key technique of this new figure of history&#8211;the crypto partisan&#8211;and their hidden revolutionary war, we can come to understand the truly explosive potential of what is hidden in &#8216;<a href="https://paywall.link/t/b55e54">crypto</a>&#8216;. It is from here that we can understand what the coming new <em>nomos</em> of humanity will look like through the use of cryptography as the base technique to reorganize the political, and come to challege the nation-state itself. </p>



<p> As Schmitt explicitly states at the <em>very</em> end of (ToP): </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;The theoretician can do no more than verify concepts and call things by name. <strong>The theory of the partisan flows into the question of the question of the concept of the political, into the question of the real enemy and of a new nomos of the earth</strong>.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<p>Through a deep reading of ToP, we can extend its theory of war into the current digital age and illuminate a &#8220;<em>new theory of war and enmity</em>&#8221; hidden at the center of cryptography. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novus_ordo_seclorum">novus ordo seclorum</a> created from <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-new-social-contract-of-crypto/">the new kind of social contract that is hidden in crypto</a> and the promise that must Bitcoin must cointain.   </p>



<h4>Aspects And Concepts Of The Last Stage</h4>



<p>Let us begin where Schmitt left off in the final chapter of ToP in defining the last stages of the evolution of the partisan. By extending and updating this analysis into the current age with the same methodology that Schmitt uses, we can trace the evolution of the partisan from a <em>telluric power</em> to a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caelus">caelumic</a></em> [Caelus, Sky] one. Through tracing the linage of the partisan from &#8220;<em>the national and patriotic heros who take to the woods, i.e., all that is characteristics of the elemental, telluric power to repel a foreign invader</em>&#8221; to the current space the digital partisan is native to, we find a new understanding of the topology of war. It is one in which the <em>potestas spiritualis</em> [spiritual authority] of the land empire of the state is abandoned for the unidentifiability and infinite topological space of the &#8216;<em>caelumic</em>&#8216; nature of cryptography in the digital age. </p>



<p>We will follow the four concepts that Schmitt defines in ToP: the spatial aspect; the destruction of social structures; the interlocking global-political context; and lastly, the technical industrial aspect, of which all feedback into the later for our first analysis. Through a deconstruction of these concepts through the lens of Bitcoin, what crypto means in a Big Brother globalized society of advanced surveillance, and the total unbracketed civil warfare (<em>stasis</em>) that is the destruction of privacy by all states; we start to see the topography of this last stage of total unbracketed war. Here in the thick fog of war, we see the ghostly spectre of the <em>caelumic</em> nature of the crypto partisan as the final figure of the coming cyphernet. </p>



<h5>The Spatial Aspect</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Completely independent of the good or ill of men, of peaceful or hostile purposes and goals, any enhancement of human technology produces new horizons and unforeseeable changes in the traditional spatial structure.&#8221;</p><cite>Carl Schmitt, ToP, p. 68</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bitcoin is the technological development of our age which has opened a new horizon for human action and freedom through the fundamental transformation of the topographical spaces of both property and war. Through the novel and unforeseeable consequence of what bitcoin has enabled through cryptography; Bitcoin has secretly declared war on every state, and all fiat money&#8211;the nourishment of any modren state. By changing the topography of economics to one totally digital in nature, and by using the mathematical forces of cryptography to create provable systems of protection, we find that crypto economics inverts state economics, fulfilling what is quoted at the beginning of this article: <em>cuius regio, eius economia</em> [Whose realm, his economics], is now <em>cuius economia, eius regio</em> [Whose economics, his realm] (Schmitt, Glossarium, 1947).</p>



<p>By sacrificing the realm of the law, for the imperium of cryptography, Bitcoin has inverted the order of law through expropriating the realm of economics into the digital as an explicit strategy not to escape the law; <strong>but to destroy it</strong>. Through this totally non-violent economic praxis that strikes directly at the root of the state&#8217;s gluttonous ways through fiat money and the seigniorage it must contain; Bitcoin creates an economic strategy of starving the Behemoth of government through withdrawing one&#8217;s economic wealth from its parasitic and criminal ways.</p>



<p>Now that bitcoin has broke the link between the state and capital, the final existentialist crisis of law, <a href="https://paywall.link/t/e3e7f6">the emergency of cryptography</a> may begin. </p>



<p>In conjunction to the direct protection of cryptography that is used to shield one&#8217;s identity (and thus depriving the state of being able to label on as &#8216;friend&#8217; or &#8216;enemy&#8217; of the state) and command total privacy, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is simply a function of truth-in-account for bitcoin units. All units of the system must have proof-of-work&#8211;real thermodynamic energy expenditure behind them in order to be minted or exchanged.  In other words,  </p>



<h3><em><a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/crypto-truth-power/">“Veritas, non auctoritas facit legem.” </a></em></h3>



<p><em>(Truth, not authority makes legitimacy)</em> </p>



<p>This is an inversion of Hobbes&#8217; dictum of sovereign power found in Leviathan, and is a weaponized form of truth in a world that is governed by lies that go so deep, it is simply called authority or law. </p>



<p>The spatial aspect of the evolution of warfare into a digital topology will always flow back into the natural defensive posture that crypto takes within the confines of the internet, and the citadel of the cyphernet that it is building as the premonition of the coming crypto age. It is in this last stage of development where the state has anointed itself as a god capable of anything, demanding to know all about everyone&#8211;there becomes nothing, nothing outside of the state&#8211;not even life. This causes for zone of indistinction that blurs all of life, politicizing everything, always reserving the right to criminalize anyone, depriving them of all economic, social, and political means and ultimately the rights to a life itself. </p>



<p>In this zone of indistinction, where the private life and political cause obscure so deeply with each other that they become one; economics itself corroborates with the security state, completely destroying the political concept of the commonality of wealth; namely the most basic commonality: the law itself. </p>



<p>It is the destruction of the <em>polis</em> through the fusion of <em>bios</em> and <em>zoe</em> into one, that has allowed for the creation of the infinitely watching eyes and ears of the technological panopticon. This surveillance apparatus exist to ensure that no one may have any real privacy anymore and that any human may be captured by it, and pulled beyond the law. This is the real state of emergency that has already destroyed our laws, our <em>nomos</em>. </p>



<p>This battle over the law is a <em><a href="http://criticallegalthinking.com/2019/02/01/giorgio-agambens-stasis/">stasis</a></em>; a never-ending global civil war that contains all of life, and every nation-state on the planet. It is <em>bellum omnium contra omnes</em> of the greatest order. Or as Foulcault said more eloquently, &#8220;<em>Isn’t power a sort of generalised war which assumes at particular moments the forms of peace and the State? Peace would then be a form of war, and the State a means of waging it.”</em></p>



<p>While the darkness and fundamental evil that is at the root of such a vision of paranoia and delusional psychosis that is the totalitarian surveillance  state of the modern age is difficult to look at; it is the world that we now live within, and is a fundamental fact that we must deal with. However, with such gross and systematic violations of not just privacy, but all of our God-given rights, the coming shipwreck of politics and law is already written, the crisis only needs to begin. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “emergency situation” in which we live is the rule. We must arrive at a concept of history which corresponds to this. Then it will become clear that the task before us is the introduction of a real state of emergency; and our position in the struggle against Fascism will thereby improve.”</p><cite>-Walter Benjamin,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/benjamin/1940/history.htm" target="_blank">On the Concept of History</a>, VII</cite></blockquote>



<p>Is there no state that does not demand to violate every single person&#8217;s privacy for the safety and security of the state? Is there no person that cannot be labeled &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217; to become be deprived of all rights and law?  This current state of emergency that has become all of our lives has violated all spaces of privacy, and demanded to interlope into all facets of life. There is no longer any space in which any person may be left alone. </p>



<p>The expansion of the surveillance state into the digital sphere is its final projection of power, and its attempt to abolish privacy through this technology is its final move in the consideration of power under this state of emergency. It is where the state can attempt to fulfill its bureaucratic destiny of attempting to seeing all things and attempt to organize all of human life and activity under the sinister rubric of &#8220;<a href="http://rebels-library.org/files/foucault_society_must_be_defended.pdf">society must be defended</a>.&#8221; </p>



<p>With Big Brother leering down at all of us with hate, vile, and contempt for the meager possibly of being an enemy; we see the digital cages and open air prisons being formed around us. It is a reality where each one of us will be ascribed digital signatures (not unlike the tattoos of the victims of the holocaust) which chains each of us to data to enables a kafkaesque reality&#8211;a total surveillance state. It is a reality in which we never know if we are really being watched or not; if we will ever get <a href="https://www.kafka-online.info/before-the-law.html">access to the law</a>, or only stand waiting before it, hoping to one day have access. </p>



<p>At the same time that the noose of the panopticon is tightening around each one of us; the true nature and power of cryptography presents itself in all of its glory. It is the final unstoppable individual right and choice to create privacy through cryptography, and to choose to create the personal wealth and freedom that allows for anyone to slip free of this noose. Through the infinite brinkmanship of privacy violations by the state and their corporate allies; so too is the development, deployment, and dissemination of personal open-sourced cryptographic technologies, and the ability to resist such personal privacy violations. </p>



<p>This brinkmanship of surveillance ends with the state demanding to know everything about every person for reasons that are state secrets&#8211;classified only for the worthy state agents and secret spy courts to know and decide upon. Naturally, through the expansion of the surveillance state into the digital sphere and the private lives of everyone; a total unbracketed civil war on privacy itself is initiated. The theater of this total unbracketed war of surveillance now opens into the plains of our private homes and into the digital noosphere that contains all of modern life. </p>



<p>In a world where privacy is being destroyed by every state, the crypto-partisan naturally presents himself as the final revolutionary figure to counter to such a nightmarish panopticon. With Satoshi Nakamoto at the helm of this new class of anonymous crypto-anarchist vanguard, the new topography of war displays itself momentarily as the fog of war shifts to a new dimension and space; where a new social order is being established beyond physical lines. </p>



<h5>Destruction of The Social Order</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;A Commonwealth exists as <em>res publica</em>, as a public sphere, and is challenged if a non-public space develops within it, which actually repudiates this public sphere. Perhaps this explanation is sufficient to demonstrate that the partisan, who displace the technical-military conduct of the 19th century, suddenly reappeared as the focus of a new type of war, whose meaning and goal was the destruction of the existing social order.&#8221; </p><cite>ToP. p. 72</cite></blockquote>



<p>At the dawn of the 21st century, the internet ushered in something totally new and unexpected&#8211;a new kind of surveillance that could look directly into the homes and lives of people. With this the machine of state capitalism could accelerate its plans for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_History_and_the_Last_Man">The End of History and The Last man</a>, with man&#8217;s final consignment to a safe life in the walled gardens of state capitalism; the empty promises of liberalism with a &#8220;safe&#8221; life of endless worthless empty work. It was the final bold move in the shift from state capitalism to oligopolic empire, that the technological panopticon became <em>the</em> device of power to bridge this gap.</p>



<p>While both the state and its greedy allies of consumerism could see the potential of the new data people were generating as early as the turn of the century; the full scope of the technological panopticon could not be complete without a &#8216;state of emergency&#8217; that would allow for the full-scale, uncensored spying on all information generated by everyone. The idea of privacy itself had to be destroyed, and only a state of emergency would suffice for such a bold violation of personal privacy and civil liberties. </p>



<p>It is this &#8216;state of emergency&#8217; which would allow for the full liquidation of all constitutional rights, and to allow for systematic, pervasive, all-seeing surveillance to watch everyone, everywhere, all the time, for any reason it sees fit under the sinister slogan &#8216;<a href="http://rebels-library.org/files/foucault_society_must_be_defended.pdf">Society Must be Defended</a>&#8216;. This opportunity for such a state of emergency would come on September 11th, 2001, with the terrorist taking center stage of the political theater that would ensnare the lives of every person on the planet. Through the panopticon of global surveillance that could now be justified through the emergency to &#8216;stop the terrorist&#8217; a state-security based network of globalized monitoring is being deployed. </p>



<p>The Chinese Communist Party has perfected this &#8217;emergency&#8217; and created a surveillance panopticon for the horrific purpose of genocide and ethnic cleansing. They have already started exporting this technology, and the window of opportunity to fight back is dwindling quickly. </p>



<p>With the mechanical eye of the machine of the state starring directly each of us, appraising each move, twitch, and shift we make, constantly seeking to appraise if we, the subject, is a political friend or enemy that must be subjected to <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/4/43/Foucault_Michel_Discipline_and_Punish_The_Birth_of_the_Prison_1977_1995.pdf">punishment and discipline</a>. This was my point in <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-sovereign-the-subject-and-crypto-power/">the sovereign, the subject and crypto power</a>, is that anyone can be deprived of their rights from any state for reasons that are deem &#8216;state secrets&#8217; to everyone. </p>



<p>The internet has destroyed all old social orders, and concepts of privacy, fully liquidating them around the global through the power of the panopticon. This has allowed for governments, businesses, or organizations anywhere to reach directly into the lives of anyone they see fit. Through the destruction of privacy, the social order is liquidated and replaced by the governmental rules of any state; whatever color of greed or oppression they may be. </p>



<p>Only in the total darkness and raw authoritarianism of &#8216;the state of emergency&#8217; would the the total destruction of all social orders and private wealth be possible. This is the real state of emergency is the impossibility of a private life, or a private wealth that is beyond the state for any reason. With the social order is collapsing into itself, the state leaves no remainder between private and public life. Life itself becomes a zone-of-indifference in which there can be no private life without the state for any reason. </p>



<p>It could only be from a world of this madness that something as miraculous as Bitcoin could be produced. Something like Bitcoin could have only been created in a world where law had abandoned itself totally for the banal avarice of greed and petty material things generations ago. Only in a world where the stupidity and vacuity of a world ran under the slogan of <em>“Auctoritas, non veritas facit legem” (</em>Authority, not truth makes legitimacy) could the truth of something like Bitcoin go beyond being just revolutionary and become the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parousia">Parousia</a> itself. </p>



<h5>Global-Political Context</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;The partisan is dependent on the constant help of a community in a technical-industrial position to provide him with the newest weapons and machinery.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p.75</cite></blockquote>



<p>It was only after the failure of the Soviet Project was the possibility of the global technological revolution that is the single internet possible. Only a widely deployed, global, single decentralized internet would be able to developed its own culture, identity, norms, and most importantly ethics that would produce Bitcoin; but also cultivate and raise cryptography on a whole to where it is today. <a href="https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence">The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a> more than twenty years ago already contains embryo of values that are reflected in the current autochthonous culture of the internet that has propelled crypto and Bitcoin to where they are today. </p>



<p>Since Barlow&#8217;s declaration decades ago, a whole generation of people have been raised on the internet who have similar sentiments, values, and desires as reflected in that declaration. These are the people who would be called the indigenous of the internet; the <em>caelumic</em> peoples of this noosphere that is only ours. These natives understand that the machine of technology is but a tool for the extensions of their own power. They are the ones who have built this place and are starting to realize the reality of what they can do with such a power. It is from these indigenous people that a renewed commonality of wealth has been forged where the motto &#8216;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_aris_et_focis">Pro Aris et Focis</a>&#8216; rings true for a new class of people and their coming of age. </p>



<p>It was however only with governments turning this technology against their own citizens that the struggle for this technology first started to grow. While the <a href="https://paywall.link/t/b55e54">anarchist roots of the cypherpunks have always been present</a>, it was only with these struggles that crypto-anarchist were produced through the code they deployed. Here we find the first traces of crypto-partisan, and the rudimentary tools from which he will liberate himself from the walled garden of society which has become a prison for all.</p>



<p>It is with the turn where governments everywhere are deploying digital technology only for the systematic violation of their own citizens, and to more deeply entrench bureaucratic controls for their own power does the crypto-partisan&#8217;s shadow start to be seen. It is from beyond the bondage of identity that he whispers secret facts that are not part of the propaganda agenda, or official media to be consumed. Facts are offered on how to escape from the incessant monitoring, how to create assured privacy, and where to find tools to hack the system and go beyond their sight and permissions. It is a praxis of blinding the technological machine and using that position as a fulcrum of power. </p>



<p>The crypto partisan offers tools and technology of the mind, methods of spiritual sacrimony, and the ability to create a private God to whom only you are privy with. It is a power to see beyond the veil of economic slavery to show anyone that there is something much, much more to this place than meets the eye. It is the possibility that we may each unlock as we start to understand the <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-new-social-contract-of-crypto/">hidden power lying waiting at the center of Bitcoin</a>, waiting for only the worth to have. </p>



<p>It is the premonition of a world that has lost its nomos; a world waiting for its providence after god has died and enough time has passed to try to remember Him, and the grace and glory of his being-in-the-world. </p>



<p>As one of the greatest poets of modren history has foretold: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Armies cannot stop an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. No army can stop an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. Nothing&nbsp;is&nbsp;as powerful as an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. There&nbsp;is&nbsp;one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that&nbsp;is&nbsp;an idea whose&nbsp;time has come.</p></blockquote>



<h5>The Technical-Industrial Aspect</h5>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Only revolutionay war made him [the partisan] a key figure of world history.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p. 77</cite></blockquote>



<p>Today the figure of the partisan is absolutely seen in the image of Satoshi Nakamoto&#8211;the first vanguardist of the crypto age. He alone initiated the total unbracketed war against all state using an explicit strategy of non-violent economic action through asymmetric cryptographic techniques to wage his revolutionary war. In taking this action, along with the political statement etched into the genesis block for all of time to see, Satoshi&#8217;s war started more than a decade ago and has been secretly building towards its revolutionary cause ever since. Satoshi, by perfectly obfuscating the image of the digital partisan, and the image of the bitcoiner, he created a new form of partisan for his war in the digital space; the crypto-partisan. </p>



<p>It is this figure, the Anonymous Other with loyalty to no state and conceals his identity for his protection alone, who is also the crypto partisan. It is this figure who has <em>caelumic</em> roots found directly in the internet who can call this territory local and their home. The crypto-partisan has a desire to keep the internet open-sourced, with strong privacy, and no boarders.  The crypto-partisan has no need for physical identities, and can stands on their own merit and signature alone. There is no need for police or physical corrosion here; just the code alone. </p>



<p>With bombaste and zeal like no other, the crypto partisan techniques go well beyond the mechanization of the code, and into the theater of politics and art alike. It is a pathos of war robbed of is physical nature and where the topology of war evolves beyond physical space, where violence no longer hodls any sway. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p> The sovereign is the point of indistinction between violence and law, the threshold on which violence passes over into law and law passes over into violence.  </p><cite><em>— Giorgio Agamben, </em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thing.net/~rdom/ucsd/biopolitics/HomoSacer.pdf" target="_blank"><em>Homo Sacer</em></a></cite></blockquote>



<p>The crypto partisan is a new figure of history, someone who is beyond the physical realm and was produced from a series of extreme techniques of war in order to create perfect forward secrecy for the protect of one&#8217;s physical security. Such a power could only be created when the technicity of cryptography had reached such a zenith that it became a permeant feature for secure communications, which in turn could create economic security. Once this technique was globally disseminated, it was only a matter of time before the core values of cryptography would start to assert their real personal, economic, and social value against other such false non-values positioned by an old and dying society that will not relinquish its bloody authority.  </p>



<p>Schmitt, in reflecting on the nature of this technicity stated, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;Pure technicity, as obtained in such purely technological reflections, produces no theory of the partisan, but only an optimistic or pessimistic series of more or less powerful assertions of value and non-value. Value, as Ernst Forsthoff aptly put it, has &#8220;its own logic,&#8217; namely, the logic of non-value and the destruction of the bearer of non-value.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p. 77</cite></blockquote>



<p>This quote can only offer its full understanding after reading the short essay, &#8220;<a href="https://www.counter-currents.com/2014/07/the-tyranny-of-values-1959/">The Tyranny of Values</a>.&#8221; By understanding Bitcoin as a form of value that demands to assert itself against non-value through the total security of cryptography by being beyond any law, we can understand the need for Bitcoin to destroy fiat money because of the inherit non-value it must contain. Here is a longer quote explaining this &#8220;value-setting&#8221; and its antagonistic nature:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The genuinely subjective freedom of value-setting leads, however, to an endless struggle of all against all, to an endless <em>bellum omnium contra omnes</em>. In such circumstances, the very presuppositions about a ruthless human nature on which Thomas Hobbes’ philosophy of the state rests, seem quite idyllic by comparison. The old gods rise from their graves and fight their old battles on and on, but disenchanted and, as we today must add, with new fighting means that are no longer weapons, but rather abominable instruments of annihilation and processes of extermination, horrible products of value-free science and of the technology and industrial production that follow suit. What for one is the Devil is God for the other…It always happens that values stir up strife and keeps enmity alive. The fact that the debunked old gods have become merely valorized values only renders the struggle more ghostlike and the fighters hopelessly dogmatic.”</p><cite>&#8211;ToP. p. 79</cite></blockquote>



<p>To display the real wealth that Bitcoin contains, both as a system of rules which is the Bitcoin blockchain and the monetary system it contains; it must assert its superiority as a money and contract system against fiat money and state legal systems antagonistically. Bitcoin does this by presenting its inviolable nature against any and all state legal systems, and Bitcoin&#8217;s total indifference to them. The most important feature of this indifference is akin to a flower in the darkest of night. Despite the seemingly total darkness, there is still a secret, natural heliotropism towards the direction of the night from which sunlight must come which the flower will always turn to before any light may be seen.  </p>



<p>Bitcoin presents a new form of value through cryptography which assures and proves itself in this fallen world where money has been totally corrupted by the state. The &#8216;value&#8217; of fiat money today is little more than political approval to spend one&#8217;s money how one wishes. Fiat money is a form of value that is devoid of real wealth because of it lacks true property rights&#8211;fiat money can always be seized by the state, for whatever reason they see fit. It is a kind of false value that can only find value within the confines of law, and not beyond it. </p>



<p>With the wide dissemination of strong encryption techniques, and the miraculous gift that is Bitcoin, there is hope for something radically and fundamentally different from the false value of fiat money. The possibly to resist the totalitarian surveillance machine with these revolutionary tactics of cryptography has already been initiated, and this should be understood as the natural development of &#8216;crypto&#8217; for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episteme">episteme</a> it is. </p>



<h4>Legality and Legitimacy </h4>



<p>This is the title of his 1932 essay on the topic of legality and legitimacy. In this essay where Schmitt predicted the fall of the Weimar Republic, and the seizure of power by either the Nazis or the communist due the the failings that are inherent to liberal constitutionalism itself. Schmitt understood that through trying to integrate enemies under the great umbrella of parlamentarism, it created the very conditions for its own downfall. This parlamentarism denies the enmity between peoples who no longer seek to negotiate freedoms with one another; but wish to actively suppress one another using the state.  </p>



<p>Schmitt gave himself over to the Nazis, and was even the mouthpiece of explaining Hitler&#8217;s actions during the The Night of Long Knives. In explaining this action (taking a clear nod towards Mussolini&#8217;s actions in the Matteotti Crisis) Schmitt gave the judicial explanation which cleared the way for fascism in Germany to seize hold. The method of how this happened clearly has infected our current legal system, and is the method by which the law has been destroyed through its stratification. </p>



<p>This was my point in <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-sovereign-the-subject-and-crypto-power/">the sovereign, the subject, and crypto-power</a>.  We are no longer citizens that are subject to the law, but are already captured within a framework where we will never gain access to the law by possibility of being an &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217;. Through the labeling of &#8216;enemy of the state,&#8217; the state can turn anyone into a nemesis that cannot be given access to the law, but only a terrorist to be deprived of it.</p>



<p>Schmitt revisits this idea in ToP, which displays the important connection of legality and legitimacy to the partisan and the legitimization of his idea of just war. </p>



<p>Without the legitimacy of a political movement to which the partisan can be attached; his actions are simply crime, and the revolutionary nature of his work can always be relegated to the criminal world. However, it is once his actions as a soldier of war have been linked to that of a political movement, that the final Clausewitzian turn can be fulfilled with, &#8220;<em>war being the continuation of political by other means.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>In order for the crypto partisan to move beyond that of the meager hacker and criminal, he must link up with and legitimize his movement with other contemporary political movements. He must create known and open political objectives for his movement with a general understanding of who the real enemy is. In short, the crypto-partisan must find his natural allies through political movements which demand the full recognition of who the enemy is, what their violations are, and what must be done to remit such damages. </p>



<h4>The Real Enemy</h4>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8220;The enemy is not someone who, for some reason or other, must be eliminated and destroyed because he has no value. <strong>The enemy is on the same level as I am</strong>. For this reason, I must fight him to the same extent and within the same bounds as he fights me, in order to be constant with the definition of the real enemy by which he defines me.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p.85</cite></blockquote>



<p>It must be understood the the enemy is a limited character. The enemy only defines himself insofar that we both desire to end hostilities and creates some means of peaceable agreement between us. This is the bracketing effect of modern war that Schmitt starts ToP with, speaks about how the bracketing of Napoleonic wars allowed for the Concert of Europe and the century of &#8216;peace&#8217; that came from that. This bracketing of war, is what has allowed for states to stop distracting themselves with fighting each other, and to turn to look at their own citizens as the absolute enemy. </p>



<h4>From The Real Enemy to The Absolute Enemy </h4>



<p>The real enemy is each of our respective governments against each of us as individual human beings. They have become the absolute enemy because they will not recognize the absolute protection that the law demands for each and every being if its weight is to have any real meaning beyond raw authoritarian power.  </p>



<p>As Schmitt has said, <em>&#8220;Tell me who your enemy is and I will tell you who you are.&#8221;</em> Through each of us just having the possibility of being the absolute enemy (the terrorist) of whatever state that may claim us, we should clearly understand who our government are to us, and who we are to them. </p>



<p>Through the destruction of all forms of privacy via the technological machine of the internet, a panopticon of the greatest order has been created. Each person today is identified and cataloged by the state, with each one of us placed in a persistent zone of indistiction that holds each of us eternally to be constantly appraised as friend or enemy.  It is the fulfillment of the prophecy that, “<em>To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so.</em> </p>



<p><em>To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>It must be clear and present to everyone who is involved in crypto that what is being created here is not about grandeur, decadence, or even money; but it is about raw and naked political power through economic liberty, and the right of every human has to such power. It has only been over the long course of the failures of the political systems of the 20th century and the continual barbarism of constant wars under which all of humanity has toiled and suffered that it has became apparent that this is the fundamental destiny of man under any modren nation-state and its corrupt and hopeless law of the wicked and damned. </p>



<p>With the radical technological expansion of the internet and the dissemination of its new techniques of knowledge in the 21st century, it was only a matter of time before the truth of all things would come to people everywhere, and the hatred and enmity that goes with such a truth. Only with a true understanding of the facts of economic and monetary history of the world do we also understand who the absolute enemy really is. With the revolutionary economic tool of bitcoin at our disposal and the radical protection of the cryptography it contains, it is only a matter of time before the final epoch of the cyphernet opens to swallow everything. </p>

  <p>In regards to why Satoshi picked the “shock” model to issuance decay, I believe (and I’m speculating here) that he wanted to minimize as many dynamic variables in Bitcoin as possible. Having an algorithm recompute issuance on a per-block basis just means more moving parts and more opportunity for exploitation. The halving code is extremely simple and comprehensible. A smooth curve would have been more complex. I haven’t seen any evidence that he deliberately configured it to set off a demand side catalyst every years.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=374951fe76fe" width="1" height="1">

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“The oath does not concern the statement as such, but is the guarantor of its efficacy: what is in question is not the semiotical or cognitive functions of language as such but </em><strong><em>the assurance of its truthfulness and its actualization</em></strong><em>.”</em></p><cite><em>-Giorgio Agamben, The Sacrament of Language</em></cite></blockquote>



<h3>The Oath of the Machines</h3>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handshaking" target="_blank">The Handshake</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is the fundamental base from which all machines communicate and exchange information. The handshake is <em>the </em>agreement which governs the code that is their language, the expressions which cannot be divided from the statement. This is the Law of Machines, it is their form-of-life, their code of law, and the handshake is the first of their agreements.</p>



<p>What is at stake in the handshake is the functionality of the code itself is  — there is no other way for the machines to communicate. The language of machines and the voice of the animal have disappeared back into one another as it is with any other animal; except for man.  The voice/language of code is the <em>only</em> method of communication that the machines have; and to have this handshake dishonored in anyway it shipwrecks the whole code before compiling, making it useless from the start. The code <em>must </em>operate with its very being at-stake in order to rending itself operable. That is what makes it code; that is the only way the operations can function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is at stake in handshake is not just the promise of what the codebase renders functional; but also the curse that is enacted when this oath is broken. Preforming the ritual of the handshake incorrectly profanes the communication, as we saw with the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://heartbleed.com/" target="_blank">heartbleed</a> bug, or other erroneous implementations of cryptographic protocols. However, this does not mean that cryptography itself is broken — in fact, this reinforces the truth of the realness of what cryptography is, and the fragility that is its liturgy.  The mathematical base and liturgical techniques that creates the divine force of cryptography is the same as it always was, and will be, and the errors of men prove it all the more so. </p>



<p>This handshake between machines enables a form-of-life that is committed entirely to itself — the enablement of the code — in which it renders the physical world repugnant. Machines do not have the forked tongue of man that allows for language to abandon itself at the moment of its utterance. The code must actualize its syntactical and linguistic meaning through its oath that the machines make with one another. Thus, this handshake the machines make with one another does not concern the statement as such, but is the guarantor of its efficacy: what is in question is not the semiotical or cognitive functions of language as such but the assurance of its truthfulness and its actualization.</p>



<p>What is at stake in the code of cryptography is the very real act of creating assured private communication through the mathematical ceremony which guarantees the privity of privacy. Through the conjuring or summoning a mathematically assured secret, which <em>verifies</em> our communications are protected by the immanence force of maths through the correct implementation of the ceremony; we create a form of divine mathematical power which no temporal power may violate with any known means today. Through the liturgical process that is the open-sourced reading of the code, and the agreement that is the privity of cryptography to ensure itself beyond all else; cryptography&#8217;s only sworn sovereign to uphold the code itself. It is this oath that the machines take to themselves and their total obligation to it that creates the base that is the liturgy of cryptography. </p>



<h3>The Liturgy of Cryptography</h3>



<p>Cryptography’s power is created by the liturgical protocols themselves— one cannot compromise the key-generation event, key exchanges, or any of the other nuance techniques that sanctify the event; otherwise the cryptography is rendered useless. But when the rituals of cryptography are exercised with the same piousness as a gnostic priest, what cryptography renders is prophetic: the encryption becomes unbreakable by any known means; and verified by the holy blessings of math. The oath of the machine to itself is actualized through the creation of the real content that is the language of encryption; the liturgical techniques that creates provably secure communications. </p>



<p>The communication is sealed and hedl by God&#8217;s immutable blessing, his inviolable signature. It is this liturgical process of the machines that renders the secret key as a sacrosaint protected by the immanence of a Spinozian God to whom in His ethics of maths there are no exceptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no more sovereign decision; only the crisis that is the truth of all things. </p>



<p>With the language of cryptography each unique mnemonic private key is like the utterance of the holy names of God in private prayer. It is the tetragrammaton of secrets themselves and the hidden power that is created through concealment itself. The creation of a private key is sacred and holy insofar that it is a singular linguistic experience in which we offer ourselves towards another form of sacral linguistic power for protection through ritualized discourse with the machine. Through the specific arrangement of words that are totally unique to a singular moment, place, and time in space&#8211;the chances of which are beyond 2^256 — we can confidently say this number will never in all of human existence be produced ever again. However, to prove God&#8217;s glory all the more, we cannot say it is impossible, for <a href="http://jimhanson.org/documents/Athrowofthedicetypographicallycorrect02-18-09.pdf">a throw of the dice will never abolish chance</a>. </p>



<p>It is this spectacular, seemingly unbreakable power found in crypto that is the very proof of the immanence of a God who loves humanity so spectacularly, he produced into the world this <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-new-social-contract-of-crypto/">new kind of social agreement</a> that is beyond any violence or law through code and cryptography alone.  With this power he can change everything. </p>



<h3>Saint Satoshi</h3>



<p>Through delivering us a man/woman/person/group so thoughtful, magnanimous, and graceful as <a href="https://paywall.link/t/bfcd4e">whoever Satoshi may have been</a>, the promise of a new age has been given to us. From their promethean effort alone, and their willingness to walk away from greatest amount of wealth any single man/woman/person/group has ever created; Satoshi created the final sacrifice the machine demanded to create its inoperativity for its messianic task.</p>



<p>Satoshi, through the sacrifice of walking away from the machine of power that is Bitcoin he created the final assurance that there would be no more third-party security holes. Through his work, and ability to abscond back into the digital sphere without a trace of his physical being, proved the power of this mathematical technique of the power of concealment. </p>



<p>Cryptography creates a kind of mathematical seal so powerful that nearly nothing could break it&#8211;that is proven as well. It is a power from a Spinozian God hidden behind a thousand and one faces, laughing the whole way as a Loki trickster God, understanding the butt of the joke the whole time from His timeless vantage point beyond all things. </p>



<p>Seeing the concourse of human history and the utter barbarism that it has been only for it to lead up to now and to be given this final weapon of cryptography seems to be only divine providence. To be at a time and place of such utter Kafkaesque darkness, the total corruption of the law, justice, and money; only to have this tool of Bitcoin present itself is beyond extraordinary, and seemingly messianic. </p>



<p>This is the decrypting of cryptography for its immanence and personal power for what it really is: unique, true, and untouchable by man and totally indifferent to the world of flesh and steel. Here no one else can gain entry, since this entrance was assigned only to you. I’m going now to close it.</p>



<h3>The Messianism of Bitcoin</h3>



<p>Through the gift and <em><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/evangelium">ēvangelium</a></em> of a non-violent, encrypted, pseudonymous, P2P global cash with a fixed known unitary supply; there is the possibility for a form-of-life that is beyond the barbarism and violence of all nation-states, and the horrors they will always entail. Bitcoin has created a spectacular bloom of ideas&#8211;that which is now called <a href="https://paywall.link/t/b55e54">crypto</a>&#8211;and all of the concepts and hopes that are being deployed and are unfurling outwards towards the final destination of radical, unadulterated freedom through cryptography. Soon these ideas that cannot be stopped will engulf the whole world in flames as the new civil war for Right begins anew, demanding from each of us to choose if a sovereign will rule over each of us; or if we are to have something totally new&#8230;</p>



<p>With these new techniques of power, anyone can mimetically create mathematical proofs that are so complex, so unique it can be said that number only exist in that single key generation event ever! It is as unique to the cosmos as atoms are to their place in the universe. We can take comfort and faith in the knowing that this sacred number shall most likely never be produced again. </p>



<p>Here is where our faith must engage too, for we cannot say it is impossible; just the proof of what we know to be true about this cryptographic proof, and the evidence of it as such. And for the truth, and goodness of this open-sourced discussion, and for the ethics it has and applies for the desire to provide us with some semblance of privacy as a right, we find a new cause. </p>



<p>Here, hidden in the depths of this technology, we find the messianic promise of cryptography, and what the sacrament of the oath means to the machines when they are bonded to it. Through fusing these two concepts&#8211;the oath of the machines, and the liturgy of cryptography&#8211; into an economic theorem, Satoshi created a new form of power that is beyond the temporal and telluric nature of all nation-states. It is an organizational form of power that opens a new topography of war through the most informational and oblique way possible.  </p>



<p>It is a most clever and graceful system of both cryptographic and economic design to trap man into a grand political-economic game where his own forked tongue as a liar and a crook acts as his final testimony against a corrupt society, broken laws, forsaken money, and wicked politics which yields only ash and sorrow. Through creating <a href="http://cryptosovereignty.org/the-new-social-contract-of-crypto/">a new form of social contract</a> which creates a new form of wealth through the power, utility, and fairness of Bitcoin, the promise it offers and the oath it must entail; Bitcoin opens an economic strategy towards a messianic new world. </p>



<p>Here is the opening for a new epoch, perhaps even the final epoch from where a new kind of time can rule, but never reign. It is a handshake with the Word of God, and the final agreement for the Truth of all things to unveil their being in order to build towards the final moment of this epoch. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katechon">Katechon</a> will unveil itself to be the nation-state and its war for total control of all things, and what that means for each of us in our final moments before the demands of such a power. It is the very summoning of the apocalypse itself so the final existential crisis of state, law, and man may begin, so that the possibility of something totally and radically new may be possible and produced. This current system of laws and debt bondage will not save us; so let us do it for ourselves. </p>



<p>When we take position of the personal power found in Bitcoin and the ability to reclaim our wealth; the real state of emergency will begin. It where law completely abandons every human for the raw fascist power of the machine, and the totalizing demand for all humans to submit to it in the name, &#8220;<a href="http://rebels-library.org/files/foucault_society_must_be_defended.pdf">Society must be defended!</a>&#8221; Here we can find the final power to close <a href="https://www.kafka-online.info/before-the-law.html">the door to law</a>, to turn away from it, and be freed from it for good by stating, as Satoshi taught us &#8220;<a href="https://paywall.link/t/bfcd4e">I would prefer not to.</a>&#8220;</p>



<p>By creating a new form-of-life through the means and mode of these new tools of crypto, and the economic liberation of Bitcoin specifically; we can build the strategy towards a totally private life that is removed from the temporal powers of any state. It is a life that is beyond the the world of flesh and steel, and opens us to a life that is beyond this physical space of wrath and tears. Through the promise of what Bitcoin is and the sacrifice that Satoshi made by walking away from the greatest sum of money any human has ever created, he initiated the final machine from which the state can be destroyed bloodlessly, and without violence. As the Ubermench of our time, Satoshi is the first citizen of the Cyphernet, and the final criminal of all nation-states by the messianic task of what the creation of bitcoin means today. </p>



<p>Through this action of creating Bitcoin and walking away, Satoshi gave us a methodology to turn away from the door of law and the power of the state in order to return to the country and nature from which we came. It is here where we find the fortitude to abandon the hope of the law to save us, that we also find the schilling point from which the multitude will meet for humanities final judgement on the criminal, and to abandon state law once and for all. It is a most wonderful creation for the liberation of all of humanity, and a hope for a future free of tyranny for the whole of the humanity leaving no exception or remainder for anything else. It is the final promise from a form of grace, love, and knowledge so powerful that it would give any individual the total power over their wealth for any reason, no matter what. It is something so wonderful and miraculous in our time and age, that it can only be called messianic for that which it promises to enable, and the nomos that it wishes to restore. </p>

  <p>Thank you Tomer! I am of the same mind. I don’t believe you have to deny the EMH to be excited about the long term prospects of Bitcoin. I think of it a bit like Amazon early in its life. All available information was reflected in the stock price, but it still appreciated a great deal as it grew into an ecommerce behemoth. A few committed investors were just more optimistic on Bezos’ ability to swallow that market than the market consensus was at the time. Similarly, the world thinks Bitcoin should be worth about $150b. For a variety of reasons I think this is a conservative view! But again, I don’t find this to be incompatible with efficient markets generally.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=5457b9144d9c" width="1" height="1">

  <p>Thanks for the comment. Agreed on virtually everything. There’s a reason I devote 80% of my time and energy to Bitcoin! Nothing that I’m aware of has a meaningful chance of catching up, especially where it counts (on credibility, fairness, the nature of the bitcoin ‘institution’ so to speak). Bitcoin is also the product of another time — one in which cryptocurrency wasn’t a mainstream idea, so no big hedge funds tried to frontrun mainstream adoption. This is an amazing quality. For the first couple years, the coins became to enthusiasts on a totally organic basis. This is such a powerful advantage.</p><p>In fact, my skepticism about launches is part of the reason I sat on this article for so long. I just couldn’t think of a reason anyone would want to launch a new coin, or why the world would need yet another coin.</p><p>However, there are a lot of unknown unknowns out there. I didn’t want to entirely write off new launches. I am sure there will be some good ideas in the future — maybe not for general cryptocurrencies, so to speak, but there may be cause to launch a new PoW blockchain. Who knows. If there indeed are new launches, I figured it would be better for the issuers to have access to my complete thoughts on the topic, as I have spent a lot of time thinking about launch methods over the years.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=490462e85e63" width="1" height="1">

  <h4>Bitcoin is everyone’s problem now</h4><blockquote><strong>Evey:</strong> Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot… But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail.</blockquote><blockquote>He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I’ve witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I’ve seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them… but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it. Ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love…</blockquote><p><strong>– Evey Hammond, V for Vendetta</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*89XHTApq3vsKiawwJkU3Nw.png" /></figure><h3>An exorbitant privilege</h3><p>Bitcoin is first and foremost a monetary phenomenon. The social climbers and false prophets who proclaimed it is a payments revolution have either come around or been repudiated by the market and washed out, embittered. Most who understood it that way are now moving on to new things. The world did not need another Paypal. <strong>The world needed a new monetary institution</strong>.</p><p>As Bitcoin went from a proof of concept, to a toy, to a joke, to a collectible, and then to a movement, a few policymakers came to realize that it posed a threat to the established system. Not because of its present form, but because what it represented: a profane insult to the carefully calibrated monetary system. All done in a mocking, insouciant fashion — a band of nerds and ne’er-do-wells insolently challenging the state’s monopoly on seigniorage. Satire is what despots fear most, and the rise of Bitcoin made our present monetary system look patently absurd.</p><blockquote><strong>Critic</strong>: Nothing backs Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Bitcoiner</strong>: What backs the dollar?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Critic</strong>: Nothing intrinsically — our ability to compel foreign nations to accept our currency as the numeraire of international trade, our ability to force citizens to pay taxes in dollars, and our military assets required to enforce both conditions.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Bitcoiner</strong>: How persuasive!</blockquote><p>The visceral hatred elites feel about Bitcoin? Perfectly justified. How else would you react to a upstart aimed at usurping your sacred monetary privilege?</p><p>Such is the potency of Bitcoin that it compels the high priests of U.S. imperialism to reveal the unwritten rules about the role the dollar plays in power projection abroad. In May of this year, U.S. Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) spoke out against cryptocurrency on the floor of the house. His statement laid bare the normally veiled post-Bretton Woods doctrine in which the dollar is employed not only a monetary tool but a strategic one, too.</p><blockquote>An awful lot of our international power comes from the fact that the dollar is the standard unit of international finance […] and it is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrency to take that power away from us […]. Whether it is to disempower our foreign policy, our tax collection, or our traditional law enforcement […]. the purpose of cryptocurrency […] is solely to aid in the disempowerment of the United States and the rule of law.</blockquote><p>Representative Sherman is practically a soothsayer. He understands <em>precisely</em> where the world is going.</p><p>His mistake is not in the diagnosis, but in the cure. He mistakenly believes that Bitcoin can be reckoned with. But Bitcoin is an idea, not a product. The notion of a weightless, virtual commodity was productized for good in 2009 (although the idea long predated Bitcoin), and it has been eroding the state’s monetary monopoly ever since.</p><p>It could not have been created at a better time; one wonders how Bitcoin would have fared if it had been created in the 1980s or 90s when the US economy was fairer, the monetary system was totally unquestioned, and the US was the sole dominant global superpower. Against today’s backdrop, Bitcoin insists on itself. It has <em>urgency</em>. In the halcyon days of Pax Americana, Bitcoin would have mattered much less. In the twilight of the American empire, however, it is more relevant than ever.</p><h4>Our monetary system is disastrously redistributive</h4><p>The wealth of political elites derives primarily from privileged access to the monetary spigot. This is no longer a secret. The heavenly mana of seigniorage has opened, first a trickle and now a flood. The world is grappling with inequality, and the dozens of populist revolts active in the world today are patent evidence of this. Yet the resurgent socialist parties misdiagnose the situation. The enemy is not a nebulous form of capitalism, but rather a form of socialism itself — a low-rates fueled perma-bailout to the owners of financial assets. It’s no coincidence that asset prices have steadfastly risen in the last decade, as the Fed has embarked on a ludicrously unshackled period of money creation.</p><p>Many ask: against the backdrop of monetary issuance, where did the inflation go? It went of course into financial assets. But this benefits the paltry few. Did you know that the decade-long rally in the S&amp;P500 has been characterized by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/business/economy/stocks-economy.html">historically low participation</a> from retail investors? The riotous gains in asset prices have sidelined mom and pop. They accrue instead to institutional investors and corporate insiders who returned capital to themselves through buybacks. In the 90s, Wharton MBAs convinced investors that the ideal mode of corporate governance was making large equity and options grants to corporate directors to create incentive alignment. Well, the grants were made, and the directors rewarded the shareholders by spending corporate earnings on buying back the stock, thus juicing earnings per share and triggering options payouts for directors. They just so happened to forgot to generate corporate value along the way. That pesky real economy… that was secondary.</p><p>Why are politicians <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/09/how-did-members-of-congress-get-so-wealthy/379848/">so rich</a>? Why do they become rich <em>after</em> leaving office? Why do regulators go work in industry? Why is the Secretary of the Treasury a former Goldman banker and hedge fund manager?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BNFFAw1Y4SR1IP3DVreZ6g.jpeg" /><figcaption>The Cantillon effect pictured</figcaption></figure><p>Why are renters historically disempowered, whereas landowners are historically privileged? Why has the cost of higher education and healthcare outpaced inflation by orders of magnitude? Why is the CPI a sad, pathetic joke? Do consumer goods account for most of your expenditures, or does rent, healthcare, and education?</p><p>What are you more exposed to? The cost of a TV, or property values?</p><p>Even if you didn’t know what the <a href="https://www.austriancenter.com/cantillon-effect-populism/">Cantillon effect</a> was, you felt it vividly in the last decade. The hopelessness felt by many in today’s society is the consequence of this monetary misalignment; the introduction of eye-watering money into the economy, but an uneven distribution. Who benefited from historically low rates? Normal folks dealing with predatory credit card loans, or owners of financial assets who were able to put historically cheap capital to work? And no, cheap financing didn’t help the middle and lower class get a foothold in property… because property values were horrendously inflated in the first place! Property, treated as a store of value for the rich, is precisely where so many of the Fed’s newly-minted dollars settled. Reflect on those hollowed-out city centers in Vancouver, New York, and London — full of empty homes used as capital warehouses for absentee millionaires.</p><p>If there’s a single graph that evidences the impact of a decade of freewheeling monetary stimulus on the economy, it is the following:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BDC17D-7L0Y0aNLHWYG9bQ.png" /></figure><p>Monetary velocity in the U.S. is at its lowest since modern records began. If you think about the equation of exchange (MV = PQ), a decline in V is sufficient to offset an increasing money supply (M) to keep prices (P) stable. And that’s just about what happened: the purchasing power of the dollar has remained relatively stable even as supply has expanded dramatically. “Where is the inflation?” is the common refrain, but the question should instead be “where has the new money supply gone?” It is clear that it has settled, inert and unproductive, in financial assets mostly owned by the ultra-rich, bidding them up to century highs in relative valuation terms.</p><p>This is why our perverse form of zombie capitalism is often referred to as socialism for the rich. If you can position yourself close enough to the money spigot and arrange to share in the spoils of the monetary redistribution, you can profit handsomely. If you have access to financial assets and can benefit from a low cost of capital (whether you are an investor or a corporate director with discretion over buybacks), you can make low rates and quantitative easing work for you. If you cannot, you are utterly frozen out of the system, and indeed disadvantaged, as pricier capital assets immiserate the non rentier class.</p><h4>Bitcoin is a system that explicitly rejects identity</h4><p>Critics often ask who, exactly, Bitcoin is for. This perhaps a misspecified question. Bitcoin does not serve a “who,” or a subset of whos. It just serves, indifferent its end users. Bitcoin, by design, does not require identity data to work. Your counterparty could be on the OFAC sanctions list, they could be a sentient toad, or a few lines of code. Bitcoin has no way of knowing, nor does it care. The only requirement to send a payment is to provide a valid signature which meets the criteria sufficient to unencumber a UTXO.</p><p>Traditional payment and credit relationships, on the other hand, enshrine identity. My credit card company is <em>very </em>interested in knowing that it is me who is using the card. If I inform them that a stranger has absconded with my card, they consider all the spends post-theft <em>totally invalid</em>. The call with the fraud department goes like this:</p><ul><li>‘Can you vouch for the $10.51 purchase on 2/24 at Chipotle?’ Yes, that was me. Extra guac.</li><li>‘Can you vouch for the $463.39 purchase on 2/29 at Lululemon?’ No, I don’t habitually buy athleisure gear.</li></ul><p>Identity data is inextricable from traditional payment networks. This is because they are many layers between payments and final settlement. An incredibly large and profitable business exists to assess the credibility of transactors and facilitate deferred-settlement transactions between them. This is because credibility and mutual trust enables massive efficiencies. You can lend your neighbor a lawnmower without demanding he provide a bond to cover its value because you <em>trust him</em>. Credit card networks just scale this up: they are trust underwriters, determining quantitatively how trustworthy I am, and passing along those assurances to merchants with whom I transact.</p><p>If they get it wrong, and it turns out I’m the kind of person who racks up a $10,000 credit card bill with no intention of ever paying, they swallow the cost! It was their bad. They should have done a better job assessing my trustworthiness.</p><p>The compact you implicitly agree to when you use Bitcoin is between you and the protocol, not between you and all the other users of Bitcoin. The only trust required is users trusting that the cryptographic and economic assumptions hold. So far, they have.</p><p>It has become trendy to denounce popular Bitcoiners as uncompromising, unreasonable assholes, and imply that there is something wrong with Bitcoin as a consequence, too. But Bitcoin is indifferent to this. It is a protocol for encoding and conveying value through a communications medium. Bitcoin isn’t even aware of what the price of Bitcoin is, let alone the political trends of the day. It knows very, very little about itself.</p><p>As stated above, Bitcoin is attractive and useful precisely because it <em>rejects</em> any identity data from the conditions required for a spend. The only thing that has to be furnished is knowledge of a private key corresponding to a public key. When you receive Bitcoin, you do not need to be aware of the identity of the sender, because Bitcoin settles probabilistically. You can simply define your own threshold for finality — say, requiring $500,000 of work to be done before you consider a transaction final. That would correspond to waiting, at current rates, for 4–5 blocks under which your transaction should be buried.</p><p>This is what allows me to accept funds from people that I mistrust, and why Bitcoin is carving out a niche in these frontier transactions. Think of a ransomware hacker and his victim. These people mutually mistrust each other. They victim has been wounded and attacked. But the hacker still trusts that the $500 sent to them for the ransom in the form of BTC is a valid, unlikely-to-be-reversed payment. You may not like this. But Bitcoin flourishes on the margins of society. These are increasingly widening, as banking becomes politicized and used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point">as a political tool</a>, as the U.S.-driven settlement system is coopted for strategic objectives, and as identity requirements for payments networks become ever more rapacious.</p><p>Transacting with people you have no reason to trust is precisely why Bitcoin exists. The internet allowed us to transact with people on the other side of the globe, but internet commerce is beset by fraud. The reason credit cards are expensive is because the costs of remediating fraud and chargebacks are socialized.</p><h4>If you aren’t comfortable with evil people using Bitcoin, you should abandon it now</h4><p>Of course, the jettisoning of counterparty trust (and risk) comes with some perceived drawbacks. Principal among them, you cannot evict someone from your network. This is very uncomfortable to people who believe that money ought to be a political tool, to be exploited to disempower political foes of the day.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YmCt6BP1X94FzjSZAkNAKw.png" /></figure><p>There is a particular paradox in demanding that the members of a network you have inserted yourself into adhere to a certain moral code of conduct. As stated above, Bitcoin, and fast-settling hard money more generally, exists to facilitate commerce between individuals that do not have a pre-existing bond of trust. What did inter-continental traders use to transact in the 17th century? They certainly didn’t use IOUs, wampum, collectibles, or credit relationships. They knew that they might never see each other again, so they used the hardest money they had available — gold and silver. Monetary metals speak for themselves; they are no one’s liability.</p><p>In this same way, Bitcoin is a means to transfer wealth between individuals who both have an interest in final settlement. It is not a means to establish a credit relationship (although Lightning is an early move in this direction). Bitcoin is deliberately amoral, it has no requirements to entry and asks nothing of the user aside from a valid signature. It facilitates commerce between people who explicitly disagree with each other. Thus trying to impose a moral code on Bitcoin is contrary to its very nature. If everyone who used Bitcoin agreed with each other, then no one would need Bitcoin — they could all exchange IOUs backed by their mutual trust in each other. But because the world is messy, and people disagree with each other, hard money is warranted. Our chaotic world practically demands it.</p><p>So if you are the kind of person that rejects a useful transactional medium because someone you dislike is using it as well, it wasn’t suited for you in the first place. Bitcoin is edgy precisely because the world needs a payment and savings system which cannot be interfered with on moral or political grounds. To repudiate these transactional constraints is to violate the carefully poised moral setting that has seized the West. If stepping out of line isn’t for you, stick to Paypal instead.</p><h4>Bitcoin is an apocalyptic death cult…</h4><p>As Bitcoin hater-in-chief David Gerard so elegantly <a href="https://decryptmedia.com/6234/curry-with-david-gerard">puts it</a>, Bitcoin is in fact an apocalyptic death cult. Apocalyptic, because Bitcoiners recognize the futility of the current monetary system, and appreciate that it is likely to end in tears. Death, because States won’t give up their monetary privilege easily. Bitcoin is veiled in eschatological overtones. Cult, because you have to be somewhat deranged to take a pill this black.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rhNLALn8SNBObZilnrxr3g.png" /><figcaption>Freedom is not “Free”.</figcaption></figure><p>So spare a thought for the Bitcoiners. They are fully awakened to the pending grief and strife that await us, Cassandras warning governments and citizens alike to the disruptive effects of truly sovereign currency (sovereign, as in free, not as in State-owned). But unable, most of the time, to convince their fellow man that the State’s monetary machinations may not be sound. Most people are content to surrender all freedom and autonomy to the Leviathan, as long as the pot they are in boils slowly.</p><h4>… but it’s open to all</h4><p>The exact reason that Bitcoin is despised by so many— identity, creditworthiness, and trust are irrelevant in this system, making it a fertile ground for criminals — is the exact reason why it’s so inclusive. Unlike Paypal, Venmo, or traditional payment processors, it cannot deplatform you for wrongthink, holding subversive political views, being a sex worker, or legally selling cannabis. Ours is the biggest possible tent. Don’t be distracted by the online discourse. Bitcoin is utterly indifferent to the political views of its users. Its core developers, the high priests of the protocol, can barely change it: (implementing a fairly routine upgrade, SegWit, took them <em>years </em>of cajoling and pleading). Getting it to do anything other than produce blocks, accept valid spends, resolve forks, and relentlessly march onward is virtually impossible.</p><p>Whether Bitcoin will challenge the State, or whether that task will be left up to a successor, is yet to be determined. That the State’s monetary privilege has been permanently eroded is evident though.</p><p>It died a little that day in January 2009 when the <em>Chancellor [was] On the Brink</em>, and it has been shrinking ever since.</p><p>By Nic Carter,<br>Oct, 2019</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below.

But Bitcoin is so hard to understand for so many, concessions need to be made.</p><p>VCs are a group of people demonized in the Bitcoin industry for not understanding Bitcoin’s value proposition. Well, how do you expect a VC to value Bitcoin if they’re only used to valuing startups?</p><p>Here is a framework that will hopefully help. It tracks the development and evolution of the Bitcoin ecosystem in discreet “fundraising rounds”, which coincide with Bitcoin’s Reward Eras. An organization is defined as “an organized group of people with a particular purpose”. If that’s the case, then Bitcoin is a well-oiled “un-organisation” with founders but no CEOs, many volunteers but no employees, and provably non-diluting equity, available to anyone who is willing to trade their energy for it.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*aewJPb_oys0JtB5A5LOqLg.png" /><figcaption>Bitcoin As A Startup</figcaption></figure><p>I will be borrowing heavily from <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/102015/series-b-c-funding-what-it-all-means-and-how-it-works.asp">Nathan Reiff’s piece “Series A, B, C Funding: How It Works”</a></p><h3><strong>Pre-seed Round <em>(1st Reward Era, 3/1/2009–28/11/2012)</em></strong></h3><blockquote>The earliest stage of funding a new company comes so early in the process that it is not generally included among rounds of funding at all. Known as “pre-seed” funding, this stage typically refers to the period in which a company’s founders are first getting their operations off the ground. The most common “pre-seed” funders are the founders themselves, as well as close friends, supporters, and family (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>The “Bitcoin Company” was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto, with its single product offering being an open-source monetary system project, known as Bitcoin. 2,100,000,000,000,000 shares were to be issued on a predetermined schedule, and anyone was free to buy or sell these shares. The founders initially held no initial equity, but equity was easy to build in those days, and rightly so. Just like any startup, it is the founding team and initial bootstrappers who should get the biggest rewards down the line for putting the most skin in the game.</p><p>Due to the nature of Bitcoin’s incentive mechanisms, many early “equity holders” were encouraged to use their time, skills and money to evangelise or develop the product, and hence increase the value of their equity. The company manages itself, in a zero-overhead environment.</p><p>During the first stage of “the company’s” life, traditionally the “the first bugs appeared and were ironed out, and this was an iterative process for many months. After proving to be robust and reliable, a market developed, and the first exchanges started to emerge. User experience, both from a software point of view, and a financial point of view, were a disaster. Bitcoin was virtually unusable without a PhD in Computer Science, and when you could use it, you’d be robbed by an exchange that had been “hacked”. Volatility was extreme, and the risk was unpalatable for the majority of onlookers. Whether or not “The Bitcoin Company” would remain “in business” was still a very dubious proposition.</p><p>This Era, the early equity holders were blessed with a parabolic bubble, and many divested some equity to give themselves runway to work on Bitcoin full time. It’s just like a fund-raise: get a big cash injection, and then burn it relentlessly until the next funding round. Coincidently, each round has exhibited at least one of these massive injections and equally massive drawn-out draw-downs.</p><p>During this Era, miners were rewarded with USD$13.5m in total block rewards and transaction fees. Assuming that, on average, cost to mine a bitcoin is equal to the market price, we can consider the mining reward to be miners buying bitcoin at-spot. Therefore, we can take the “money-in” for the round to be the cumulative miner’s revenue. Money-in is never consistent, and even a small injection is enough to make the price fly and form a bubble.</p><p>With all the above said, fortune favours the bold, and Bitcoin entered its seed round at a $1bn pre-money valuation (i.e. Bitcoin’s Market Cap was $1bn at the end of the first reward era).</p><h3><strong>Seed Round <em>(2nd Reward Era, 28/11/2012–9/7/2016)</em></strong></h3><blockquote>You can think of the “seed” funding as part of an analogy for planting a tree. This early financial support is ideally the “seed” which will help to grow the business. Given enough revenue and a successful business strategy, as well as the perseverance and dedication of investors, the company will hopefully eventually grow into a “tree.” (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>Risk of short-term ecosystem death did not substantially decrease until the end of the Secord Reward Era. You could say that the risk profile dropped from “Extreme” to “Very High”. In terms of PR/Optics, this was arguably the worst and most dubious “round” of Bitcoin’s existence. In the face of these FUD-inspiring superficial problems, Bitcoin did what it does best — got on with it.</p><p>This era saw the first Bitcoin bubble to be featured in Mainstream Media in some way shape or form. Going from catastrophe to catastrophe; from the numerous exchange hacks, scams, asset seizures, 51% attacks (GHash.io) and China bans, those who invested in the mania of 2013 would not break even until the Third Reward Era. Inflation made things worse, with the market having to absorb the 5.25 million Bitcoin producing during the Era. However, those who divested during the mania provided themselves with many years of runway to give back to Bitcoin and make their equity more valuable.</p><p>In this Era, we started to see the emergence of user-friendly plug-and-play hardware wallets; the age of ASIC mining was in full swing, with miner fabrication done at a huge scale. The gamblers had a field day — with the majority of “fiat-onramps” providing toys for the traders, but not for the savers. For better or worse though, this added much needed liquidity and means for price-discovery. That said, liquidity was quite low, and for the first half of the era when the exchanges were just so sketchy, you couldn’t even really trust what the advertised market price was.</p><p>The first VCs entered the game; some investing in Bitcoin companies, and others, like Tim Draper, investing directly in the underlying.</p><p>Miners were not put off by the prolonged bear market, with the network hashrate growing by orders of magnitude mostly due to competition-driven innovation among ASIC fabricators. In the Second Reward Era, miners earned a total of USD$600m for their efforts. This USD$600m “investment” resulted in an $11bn post-money valuation at the end of the Round.</p><p>Despite failing to reclaim the heights of 2013, Bitcoin closed this round on the upswing — one that wouldn’t end for another year and a half.</p><h3><strong>Series A — Optimise <em>(3rd (and Current) Reward Era, 9/7/2016 — May 2020)</em></strong></h3><blockquote>Once a business has developed a track record (an established user base, consistent revenue figures, or some other key performance indicator), that company may opt for Series A funding in order to further optimize its user base and product offerings. (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>With “traditional” startups, their Series A round is used to fund the optimization of the offering, and to lay a solid platform to build further during the next round. Several experts and industry stakeholders were split on how to best optimize Bitcoin to increase transaction throughput. The Establishment took the view that achieving this through an increase in block size was the answer, The People took the view that this was a slippery slope, and that scaling be achieved with protocol optimisations, i.e., Segregated Witness (SegWit). The People were victorious, which was a huge positive indicator that centralizing Bitcoin would be a Sisyphean task. As a result, and in combination with a supply halving, the money flowed in, and Bitcoin achieved a valuation in the hundreds of billions at its all-time-high.</p><p>The Third Era also featured “The Scambrian Explosion”, with thousands of cryptocurrencies being spawned, sending Bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency to a paltry 35% at one point in time. While most of these altcoins now having lost over 95% of their value (hundreds have lost &gt;99% of their value), the only result was the wasting of hundreds of thousands of hours of development time and hundreds of millions of dollars which should have been directed at Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin now accounts for 75% of the cryptocurrency market (and rising) is a testament to why people should have just stuck to Bitcoin.</p><p>The huge influx of money in this Era allowed early equity holders to further divest to focus on development — and my oh my, was there a lot of development. In terms of scalability, The Lightning Network successfully came out of beta and is being extensively used. Privacy and coin-joining solutions emerged and became easier to use. There are literal satellites in space broadcasting the network. The rise of the “run your own node” movement gathered serious momentum and was bolstered by a host of companies offering “plug-and-play” nodes. With your own node, you can also be your own payments provider through BTCPayServer. Multi-signature security has never been easier. This paragraph could go on for pages — so if you want a full technical recap of just 2019, the <a href="https://bitcoinops.org/en/newsletters/2019/12/28/">Bitcoin Optech Newsletter will give you everything you need to know</a>.</p><p>At time of writing, Era miner revenue is USD$4.6bn, and the valuation has risen from $11bn to over $125bn.</p><p>Despite all the progress made, Bitcoin is still a high-to-very-high risk investment at this stage, as the market price can still move in excess of 30%, in either direction, in one week, regularly. This will ultimately remain the case until both the liquidity pool grows, and the mining reward (inflation) shrinks.</p><h3><strong>Series B — Build <em>(4th Reward Era, May 2020 — Apr 2024)</em></strong></h3><blockquote>Series B rounds are all about taking businesses to the next level, past the development stage. Investors help startups get there by expanding market reach. Companies that have gone through seed and Series A funding rounds have already developed substantial user bases and have proven to investors that they are prepared for success on a larger scale. Series B funding is used to grow the company so that it can meet these levels of demand</blockquote><p>With the necessary protocol upgrades happening during Series A and early in Series B, the focus will shift to the building of products and services on top of the slowly ossifying Bitcoin base layer. This Era will see the replacement of the “Old Guard” by a newer generation of more business-savvy Bitcoin entrepreneurs and through merger and acquisition activity.</p><p>There will also be a lot of vertical and horizontal integration, as companies aim to achieve a “full-stack”. One example of all this is Layer1 mining, in what is effectively an electricity utility that also mines, and designs and fabricates ASIC miners.</p><p>It is impossible to predict what’s specifically going to happen during this 4 year era, let alone in the first year of it, but if the past 18 months are anything to go by, security, privacy, and most importantly going forward, UI/UX, will improve dramatically. I’d expect that running a full-sovereignty stack (your own VPN, node, electrum &amp; BTCPay servers, multi-sig setup, etc.) will be easy enough for <strong>almost anyone</strong> to do at the end of The Era. Effectively, Bitcoin’s infrastructure will be developed enough to handle some proper scale.</p><p>What will be most interesting thing to see will be the technological, economic and political developments during this Era. In this regard, everything is “Good for Bitcoin”. Internet access, computers and smartphones become cheaper and more accessible? This is good for Bitcoin. Never ending quantitative easing and negative interest rates? This is good for Bitcoin. Increased political turmoil, censorship, or surveillance? This is good for Bitcoin.</p><p>Should Bitcoin “stay in business”, risk level at this point would be medium-to-high, and you could expect to be exposed to weekly swings of +/-15%, but maybe not as regularly as in Series A.</p><p>When looked at in conjunction with some economic models like the Stock-to-Flow model, there is little reason to think a 10x growth in market cap will not be seen in this series, as per the 3 series preceding it. This would mean a series-end market cap of about USD$1 trillion, or, around USD$50k per bitcoin. Chances are that the All-time-high price achieved during this series will be dramatically higher than the end price, as this is the main driver of the “investment-to-utility” loop.</p><h3><strong>Series C — Scale <em>(5th Reward Era, Apr 2024 — Mar 2028)</em></strong></h3><blockquote>Businesses that make it to Series C funding sessions are already quite successful. Series C funding is focused on scaling the company, growing as quickly and as successfully as possible. (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>Inflation is finally starting to drop, with only ~650,000 BTC needing to be absorbed by the market over the 4-year period — the inflation rate is now lower than that of Gold. Scarcity is becoming a more dominant element of Bitcoin’s value proposition.</p><p>With basically all the infrastructure largely built, and UI/UX continuing to improve, this Era is “The Era of The Evangelist”. Bitcoin is ready for prime time; somebody just has to go out and tell everybody. This Series’ fund raising round made all the right people very wealthy (if they weren’t already wealthy from the Series B raise), and these people will begin to use their influence (i.e. money) to promote Bitcoin, and increase the “saver-base”, i.e., the number of people who buy bitcoin on a weekly basis, or, earn their living in Bitcoin.</p><p>At this stage, to maintain a USD$500k price, about 10 million people are each saving USD$150/wk in Bitcoin. This represents 0.2% of the world’s adult population. Considering the level of utility and the seamlessness of the UI/UX in the late stages of this series, only 10 million active savers may even feel like a failure of sorts! From here, it is simply an exercise of marketing.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FkYmUI3pdPTM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DkYmUI3pdPTM&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FkYmUI3pdPTM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://medium.com/media/da4a47f6535454fc2f34dc44828543b6/href">https://medium.com/media/da4a47f6535454fc2f34dc44828543b6/href</a></iframe><h3><strong>IPO <em>(6th Reward Era, Mar 2028 — Feb 2032), and beyond…</em></strong></h3><p>At this point, if Bitcoin is still alive, it is effectively unkillable. Major banks have now made big acquisitions, and are offering bitcoin services to their customers. Most power utilities have skin in the Bitcoin game. People won’t know that they’re using Bitcoin — and we’ll probably have 4 (or even 5) layers on top of Bitcoin now. On-chain base-layer transactions are reserved for high value transactions, all people adopting Bitcoin going forward won’t be onboarded via the base layer. The Bitcoin ETF has FINALLY been approved after an 18 year effort. Price per coin is in the millions, and fairly stable (to the downside, at least). Number still go up — just as designed.</p><p>It’s improper to say that it is “zero risk” in 2032, but the risk is extremely low. That said, if it gets to a 7th Era, I’d be comfortable enough to say that Bitcoin may become the first ever truly risk-free asset, with inflation rapidly approaching zero. I’ll be 50 years old by the end of Era 7, so I’m literally betting my career that this will be the case. Talk about skin in the game!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=769c387c97ca" width="1" height="1">

  <p><em>Disclaimer: I have no current or future interest in a new cryptocurrency launch, either personally or professionally. This piece is intended generally as a thought experiment, and is NOT an endorsement of any specific project. I do not recommend or condone the creation of any new base-layer cryptocurrencies.</em></p><h4>Foreword</h4><p>The presence of ASICs in Proof of Work systems has always been deeply contentious. At maturity, ASICs enhance the security of the network (by forcing miners to <a href="https://uncommoncore.co/research-paper-a-model-for-bitcoins-security-and-the-declining-block-subsidy/">take a long term stake</a> in the success of the protocol), but in the transitional phase, the first hardware manufacturer to build ASICs has a near-monopoly on the minting of new coins. This can lead to the existence of an informal form of seigniorage — minting money at a discount to its market value. Protocols which fork frequently are also exposed to this risk; developers effectively have the ability to determine which PoW function the chain will move to, giving them the ability to monetize their influence over the protocol. This is a potentially very insidious form of corruption, and it impairs the ‘fairness’ quality that PoW is known for. GPU chains also have the undesirable quality of being ‘nicehash-able’ — that is, attackable by renting commodity hardware for a short period of time. There is no long-term bond required to mine a GPU coin, as the hardware is repurposable and salable.</p><p>Mindful of these issues, I started thinking last year about how an ASIC launch might work. Not because I have any interest in participating in one, but simply because I find it interesting to think about these tradeoffs. This culminated in this tweet:</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>It&#39;s only a matter of time (&amp;lt;12 months) until we see a fair launch with an exotic PoW released by a dev team that has also made ASICs that work exclusively with that PoW. No details of the algorithm will be released until genesis block.</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;<a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/994203692827062272">@nic__carter</a></p></blockquote><script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><script>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});</script><script>if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}</script><p>About a month later, Obelisk (a subsidiary of Nebulous) published their proposal for a commercial service, dubbed Launchpad, which could facilitate PoW launches with custom pre-built ASICs.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/obelisk-blog/introducing-obelisk-launchpad-b78756eaa74c">Introducing Obelisk Launchpad</a></p><p>I put my tweet in this article to demonstrate that I’ve been ruminating on these ideas for a long time, and I’m not writing this opportunistically to lend ‘moral support’ to any specific launch. I have had this piece mostly written for a long time, but I neglected it because I figured that PoW launches were essentially defunct and that there wouldn’t be a great deal of interest in them.</p><p>In fact, I was wrong about the timeline — no such launch that I am aware of occured in the 12-month period following the tweet. But it has come to my attention that a few teams are contemplating similar launches today. Thus I felt that my thoughts on this matter might be useful. Not for the benefit of any particular team, but because this gives us an interesting canvas to evaluate issues that are critical to the social scalability and security of these networks, whether it’s Bitcoin or other PoW chains.</p><p>If someone is intent on launching a new public blockchain, I firmly think non-premined PoW is the best way to do it, for a number of reasons, which I’ll get into later in the article. But I feel that GPU launches are increasingly more difficult and risky. I cannot stop anyone launching a chain. But I think a careful analysis of the tradeoffs might encourage teams to do things more responsibly, or, at the very least, explore other parts of the design space.</p><p>Lastly — some of you will be upset by my musings around how a new <em>generic </em>blockchain might be launched. If this is the case, I’d recommend simply closing the tab and disengaging. Additionally, while I think Bitcoin is likely sufficient as far as non-state monies go, I am also not willing to permanently rule out the potential emergence of some other PoW blockchain. I don’t see why we’d need another one <em>now</em>, but I find it hard to believe that Bitcoin is both the first and last viable blockchain ever to be created. I’m not afraid of competition, either. I think Bitcoin has its own unique merits, and smaller launches don’t compete with it or impair it in any way. Since it’s entirely possible to me that we do end up with another PoW chain at some point, it’s worth thinking about how to launch them.</p><p>Just so I’m absolutely clear on this: I’m not endorsing any specific launch or coin, or even new PoW launches generally. In fact, I would generally discourage anyone from launching a new blockchain. They tend to be boondoggles or ghost towns. But I am not ruling out the potential existence of a new blockchain at some point in the future.</p><h4>Introduction</h4><p>New cryptocurrency launches are beset by a strange paradox: they typically require a single, authoritative entity to spearhead development, to manage the process of launch, and coordinate development for a meaningful period throughout its infancy. Generally, a considerable amount of upfront investment in R&amp;D is required to create a differentiated protocol. All of these features tend to require the organizational and financial efforts of a single entity.</p><p>But of course the backing of a corporate entity (or the more subtle, let’s-pretend-there’s-no-organization-pulling-the-strings-here model) is a critical point of centralization. This means that adversaries have very obvious buttons to press if the protocol grows too big or disruptive; generally speaking, anyone hostile to the network will have an abundant ability to interfere with it. Additionally, these administrative entities often choose to retain not only a large fraction of supply, but also discretion over decision making, trademarks, and vetoes over future development directions. Much like Engels’ quote around the “withering state” as the end result of a socialist utopia, the claimed “path to decentralization” in monetary protocols is closer to rhetoric than reality.</p><p>To truly commit to surrendering power, the founders of these projects must be comfortable with austerity and eventual irrelevance. It’s sometimes said that Satoshi’s second most brilliant insight, behind creating Bitcoin, was leaving the project. Lamentably, virtually no cryptocurrency founders since have followed his lead, preferring filthy lucre and a shot at joining the Davos class, alongside their fellow central bankers.</p><p>Numerous models of protocol financing have been attempted over the years: the bitcointalk premine, the more sophisticated ICO, the founders reward, the covert premine and backdated whitepaper, the instamine, the merged fork. The purists will maintain that nothing other than a proof of work fair launch (ensuring no seigniorage, not even for the developers) is sufficient to confer the founding team with the legitimacy to create a worldwide protocol.</p><p>They have a point: it’s vanishingly unlikely that, if a meaningful portion of the world switches to a neutral cryptocurrency protocol, that future buyers of the coin would find it acceptable to enrich founders who allocated themselves 20% or more of this global currency for free. Seigniorage — more generally, the distinct feeling of unfairness, or being cheated — leaves a particularly nasty taste in one’s mouth. This, rather than any technical foibles, will be the doom of most of those sexy new high-TPS VC-backed base layer protocols. These aren’t startups: these are monies, competing on credibility, neutrality, institutional stability, and fairness. Private equity is concentrated and unfair, but you don’t need to use Uber stock to buy your daily bread. For something as essential as money, fairness is critical. A deeply unfair launch is an ugly miasma, lingering nastily, poisoning the authenticity of the project.</p><p>The singular appeal of a Proof of Work launch is not simply in the distributional advantage that at-home mining gets you (although this is a potent and underrated feature). No, the most important feature of the PoW fair launch is that it ensures that it is impossible to acquire coins for below market rate. You can purchase the coins on the market or with electricity; no one is entitled to an insider deal. Compare this to a dev team premining an ERC20 and then dripping it out on the market over a period of years. This looks cosmetically the same a PoW. But it’s not — because that team was able to acquire all the coins for $0. It would be similar to PoW if the dev team took the funds they received in exchange for the coins and set them on fire.</p><p>Of course, the disadvantage inherent in the ‘fair launch’ is the fact that it’s challenging to monetize the network, especially early on. This is fine if developers are happy to work idealistically or altruistically. In Bitcoin, patrons eventually emerged, as the network came to be systemically important. Today, a rich and diverse set of patrons subsidize dozens of core developers to keep the chain running smoothly and work on long term infrastructure. This is perhaps the ideal model; but Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first, the most critically important, and not having venture backers to reckon with. Today, any new cryptocurrency struggles to distinguish itself. Obtaining sufficient traction to survive on patronage or donations is a tall order. And as far as front-loaded R&amp;D goes, this is virtually impossible to finance without some sort of sale of future rights to protocol tokens. Many will point to the Grin case study here. Having made the somewhat anachronistic decision to aim for a proof of work fair launch targeted at GPUs, the Grin team struggled to monetize. Donations so far have been relatively scarce. A cautionary tale, to many.</p><p>Of course, those smugly deriding the weaknesses of the fair launch model tend to do so with the implicit intention of advertising straightforwardly exploitative launch models of their own. Let he who is without premine cast the first stone. Even though Grin has struggled for financing so far, its odds of becoming a significant monetary asset are not encumbered by securities laws issues, by the risk of the founder being arrested, or by the community becoming disenchanted as they are exploited by VCs dumping on them at the the first opportunity (For those who don’t believe me, read the fundraising decks of the crypto funds targeting token strategies. That language about low “time to liquidity” — that’s code for “we plan to exit our token positions at the public sale, because we want to secure a riskless return and dump this asset as soon as possible”).</p><p>The 2014–18 era ICO was, for the most part, a disastrous financial instrument. I have never come across a single one that I felt was issued responsibly to the public. Once these stopped being accessible to the general public, they lost their sole advantage: wide, permissionless distribution (note that this is a native feature of PoW). The issues with ICOs, especially those opting immediately for a proof of stake authority model (instead of a PoW bootstrapping, as Ethereum wisely opted for), are numerous:</p><ul><li>Insiders can purchase their own crowdsale, and covertly obtain an arbitrarily high fraction of supply for free (because they also get to collect the funds committed to the crowdsale)</li><li>Buyers can obtain tokens for arbitrarily low prices, since they are not created in a costly manner through proof of work, but summoned out of thin air. Thus, the private rounds that predate public sales often consist of pure seigniorage</li><li>Tokens often end up being a bizarre mishmash of an informal investment contract, and an arcade token for unlocking network resources. This causes speculation to crowd out usage and leads to very confused theories of value accrual</li><li>Tokens sold to the public (or done obliquely, a la Telegram) closely resemble investment contracts in most sensible jurisdictions, and this tends to make the issuers subject to securities laws, whether they like it or not</li><li>Issuers that retain a large fraction of supply tend to retain authority in the network, especially if a Proof of Stake model is opted for. This hampers the path to decentralizing authority, as issuers tend to resist divesting their share of the network</li><li>Early backers can obtain disproportionate shares of supply for essentially free, and then <em>costlessly retain that advantage in perpetuity </em>if the network follows a PoS model. This is a potent force which chills the dispersion of tokens, as stakers are not compelled to sell. In PoW, by contrast, miners must constantly spend and invest to retain proportional network authority. In PoS, retaining stake is simply the cost of running a server</li></ul><p>My central point is this: the principal challenge in the administration of a new monetary commodity is not a technical one. Of course, your blockchain must have compelling technical features. But ultimately the difficulty lies in climbing the wall of indifference. At inception, no one cares about your system. At maturity, you need tens and possibly hundreds of millions of individuals to care. If you give early investors discounted access to a significant fraction of supply, and then give them powerful anti-dilution rights (while hoping/expecting that future individuals will <em>use</em> your network as working capital and tolerate some dilution, in effect subsidizing the early buyers who passively stake), you risk creating a patently unfair system in which the winners are a function of the arbitrary prehistory of the chain.</p><p>Attracting anyone to a network like this strikes me as profoundly unlikely. Why your chain? Why not an equivalent fair launch, where every owner worked for their coins, instead of receiving an allocation through some proximity to the founding team?</p><p>But, ICOs, premines, and founder-tax coins have a crucial advantage: the ability to subsidize work on the protocol, even prior to its launch. Naively presuming that, in 2019, not all the cryptocurrency protocols that will ever exist have already been launched, one might go as far as to say that subsidizing work on a protocol prior to its launch might be a desirable property. So can one mix and match the desirable qualities of a coin launch while avoiding the worst of them? I certainly think so. Let’s review three popular models:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*VN_nNkMytvDXSysPnYhjWg.png" /></figure><p>Certainly more cons than pros in this case. In the U.S., selling rights to a cryptocurrency, especially to the general public, seems to be out of favor with our securities regulators. Not recommended. Additionally, giving early backers or big holders permanent, cheap-to-exercise anti-dilution rights dulls the dispersion of tokens, limiting its reach. We have fairly good data on this, thanks to the transparency that blockchains offer us. (I’d love to see a serious piece of work comparing the dispersion of ownership in PoS chains versus PoW chains. If you’re a researcher who is interested in taking this on, get in touch! I have data.)</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OgB3c5Z00ICK_Js_iXqkxA.png" /></figure><p>A classic. The Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and Grin model. A sensible approach, but difficult to bootstrap support, and reliant on community funding or patronage for ongoing support. Very effective and hard to kill if you can pull it off — but it requires a huge amount of community building to get traction. These appear to be getting less and less viable with time, especially as the financial stakes have grown. I’d expect that virtually all GPU launches today would be subject to the risk of insiders with prior knowledge of the algorithm covertly creating ASICs.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6I1EarSyeyRF8VZV0Fdjnw.png" /></figure><p>This this hybrid model, pioneered by Zcash. This is essentially equivalent to a vested premine. It better aligns incentives than a pure premine, as the allocations are not unlocked for a number of years. Nevertheless, the proposal has issues of its own: in the case of Zcash, the protocol has been racked with controversy over whether the administrator should receive additional protocol-derived funding. The spigot of seigniorage is very hard to turn off, once active.</p><p>At this point, you might be wondering why I don’t simply agitate for vanilla PoW fair launches. By this rubric they seem plainly superior. But they aren’t without their issues. I think it’s worth being realistic about GPU PoW launches. Let’s look at a couple recent case studies.</p><h3>Why GPU fair launches might be a thing of the past</h3><p>As someone who followed the Grin launch rather closely, I must admit that it felt like a nostalgic last foray into a prior era. I got a decidedly Proustian pang from watching the process play out. As if I had dipped my madeleine in the tea and been transported back to the glory days of PoW launches from 2012–14.</p><p>The gossip going around about “$100m in VC-backed SPVs” was hyperbolic, but the launch certainly had problems. Initially hoping to stay ASIC-resistant in perpetuity, the developers ultimately opted for a pragmatic GPU-to-ASIC phased approach, envisioning a slow transition to an ASIC dominated network, but hoping for some more widely accessible GPU mining to begin with. There was a period of GPU mining, but some miners are now reporting to me that ASICs, or at least more efficient hardware (FPGAs), have begun to take a significant share of hashrate, somewhat ahead of the desired schedule. This isn’t exactly a failure, but it does illustrate the colossal difficulty inherent in the notion of ASIC resistance.</p><p>You are creating an enormous bounty for anyone to anticipate the PoW change, or to lobby the developers for a favorable outcome. The Grin developers did dither a little bit on the ultimate model for PoW (this was naturally a rather fraught discussion) and this ambiguity caused a lot of gnashing of teeth and lobbying efforts. It would have been far more efficient, overall, if resources had not been allocated to lobbying developers for a favorable hash function. Ultimately, the devs took extreme care to make the chain hostile to ASICs at inception, but they couldn’t stem the flow. They didn’t opt for ASICs right away due to a naive view that GPUs would dominate for the early history of Grin (and the difficulty coordinating this model with a distributed, non-corporate team), but ASICs (or at least FPGAs) appeared anyway.</p><p>Most ASIC resistant chains are beset by this same difficulty. They effectively create a massive bounty for teams to create FPGAs or ASICs and fly below the radar, hoping they aren’t discovered. Su Zhu says it well here:</p><style>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}</style><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-align="center" data-dnt="true"><p>Every coin which is targeting GPU-mining is being stealth FPGA-mined at the very least, if not ASIC-mined already.

As we learn more about the PoW security model, it’s clear that all but the largest GPU-mined networks are simply unsafe. Ethereum is probably an exception because it accounts for such a large fraction of the world’s GPUs, and they cannot be sold or rented in sufficient numbers. Aside from the structurally difficulty of acquiring sufficient hash power, this means that successfully attacking Ethereum would cause the value of GPUs worldwide to depreciate, which is a strong disincentive for any attacker. Aside from Ethereum though, most GPU mined coins are exposed to this risk of rented hardware being used to attack the chain, and we’ve seen copious examples of this. If you believe that dedicated hardware helps with security, then you will prefer the ASIC model. This approach gives you ironclad security from inception.</p><h4>The investment contract-like element is firmly disentangled from the actual coins</h4><p>In the case of an ICO, you have tokens which are presold to buyers. If these are understood to be investment contracts, or securities, this potentially compromises the entire supply of tokens, and inhibits their ability to circulate on exchanges. In an attempt to circumvent this, it has been argued that the investment contract covers only <em>rights</em> for future tokens, and that the<em> tokens themselves</em> are not the subjects of the investment contract. It’s under this reasoning that the ETH in the presale are understood to have likely been the subject of an investment contract, but the outstanding units of ETH at delivery of the blockchains were not themselves securities. I don’t really buy this distinction — at the very least, I find it tortured. I find it easier to simply distinguish the two.</p><p>In the case of the ASIC presale, you very clearly distinguish the investment contract from the coins themselves. If there’s anything which is security-like, it’s the ASIC sold to investors (although, as noted, it’s entirely possible that these aren’t even securities, as end users have to actually operate them and feed them with electricity, obviating the ‘efforts of third parties’ prong of Howey). The actual coins themselves are totally in the clear, in my opinion, since they are issued by the protocol in the manner of a conventional fair launch. I think we have copious evidence that fair launch tokens are not understood to be securities by the SEC. This gives potential users really convenient assurances that the trading of the asset won’t suddenly be restricted to security token trading venues. This is one of the greatest advantages of the model.</p><h4>You get PoW distribution AND developers can finance themselves in a limited capacity</h4><p>The distributional advantages of PoW have, to date, not been very well documented, but I have a strong intuition that they lead to better dispersion of supply. Relative to the vanilla PoW launch, developers can also finance R&amp;D and administrative costs involved in launching a new chain. And they’re not violating securities law. Sweet!</p><h4>You get an arbitrarily long distribution period</h4><p>Many have noticed that, as far as new monies are concerned, the existence of temporal contingency in distribution introduces an arbitrariness which limits the dispersion of the currency. In other words — short issuances (some ICOs were over in minutes) guarantee that the supply will be highly concentrated. Longer issuances give everyone a shot at obtaining the units of coins. This was part of the intuition behind the yearlong EOS ICO, which was a rather clever idea (aside from the fact that the crowdsale wallets had continuous outflows during that time, leading to conspiracies about recycling treasury funds back into the ICO). If you think about it, the EOS yearlong tokensale was somewhat akin to a PoW launch (with the exception being that the coins contributed to the crowdsale were not burned). Proof of Work gives you an extended <em>permissionless </em>distribution phase, although the decaying block reward means that new supply is much more abundant early on. Bitcoin’s issuance will last over 100 years, but over 80% of all Bitcoins have already been mined.</p><p>Comparing a PoW launch to a generic ICO, it’s very clear that permissionless access in a newly-launched ICO is impossible. Tezos straddled this transition, following a no-KYC crowdsale with a subsequent forced KYC process to unlock user Tezzies. I would imagine that all subsequent ICOs (to the extent that they do occur) will follow suit. The difference with PoW is that you are acquiring coins from a protocol. While ASIC suppliers might ask for KYC, generally speaking, mining is a much less permissioned environment than ICOs or crowdsales. Add in the reality that electricity is much more globally available than access to capital markets, and PoW looks very attractive. A protocol retailing off coins in exchange for electricity over a long period of time is an extremely potent means to issue an asset to a global audience. No one has devised a better way so far.</p><h4>The rules of the game are very clear</h4><p>One of the biggest issues with PoW chains in this day and age is ambiguity, especially around changing hash functions. When you have ambiguity, you have debate, and lobbying, and the possibility for developers to exploit their privileged status within the system. This is generally disastrous, and reduces social scalability, as well of the credibility of the system. If a small group of individuals if found to be abusing their protocol access to monetize, the system’s credibility is compromised. One alternative is to simply set the PoW function and commit to never changing it (this is essentially what Bitcoin has opted for, and why Bitcoin should never change its PoW unless something catastrophic occurs). That’s what this model calls for. No debate; no lobbying; no covert exploitation.</p><h4>The initial advantage depreciates over time, providing the system with natural dispersion</h4><p>Unlike something like a PoS token sold in a presale, the initial balance of power in the ASIC launch system changes dramatically over time. Initially, a select few have near-monopoly rights on supply. But this is a temporally limited advantage, and the appearance of new ASICs, or even simply the passage of time, and the depreciation that that brings, erodes that initial advantage. I want to emphasise that I consider this a good feature. Too much power granted to the early stakeholders in the network — plus the ability to retain this power, costlessly, in perpetuity, is a dysgenic feature. This massively inhibits the dispersion of the holder base. The presence of PoW is useful here. It induces constant selling on the part of miners, reducing their protocol-proximate privilege. The same cannot be said for staking. While in the case of the ASIC launch we have a privileged few early on, their advantage rapidly depreciates.</p><p>Let’s unite everything in a big chart, to compare how the alternative launch methods deal with various downsides.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*29BZF4tgyMridwa6nAP0Bw.png" /></figure><p>While I think this is an interesting and attractive model for a new launch, there are certainly some open questions still, especially as we’ve never seen it done in the wild. These are some of mine:</p><ul><li>is it possible to extract a margin on ASICs sufficient to render this a profitable enterprise?</li><li>what is the shape of the supply curve such that the temporary monopoly on supply would be considered acceptable to future users?</li><li>how can ASIC buyers have confidence that no additional ASICs were covertly created?</li><li>can one-shot financing be sufficient to bootstrap a business building an open source protocol?</li><li>is the limited amount of seigniorage disqualifying in terms of creating a monetary asset?</li><li>are the ASICs themselves investment contracts/securities, or are they in the clear?</li><li>is it possible to build an ASIC supply chain that doesn’t concentrate with one or two entities having unilateral control over the hardware production process?</li></ul><p>What do you think? Worth trying or a pointless waste of time? I’m curious to hear your thoughts. I feel that launch methods are generally under-covered, so I hope that this post kicks off some discussion, regardless of whether this model is considered viable.</p><h3>Objections</h3><p>I will consider a few objections here.</p><h4>If you applied this model to Bitcoin, six months of mining would represent 1.3m BTC, which is an excessively large fraction of supply</h4><p>You can tune the shape of the supply curve however you like, to give the monopolists in those first 4–6 months an arbitrary fraction of supply. You could design the curve such that they get 0.1% of supply or 99.5% of supply. I think an issuer would probably aim to target something like 5–10% of supply for that initial period, but that’s a totally wild guess.</p><h4>Why do you expect that the initial batch of ASICs will last 4–6 months? Why wouldn’t they last essentially forever and give ASIC buyers a permanent advantage?</h4><p>If the protocol actually ends up being relatively significant, market cap-wise, then ASIC manufacturers will inevitably jump in and make ASICs for it. From conversations with ASIC manufacturers that I know, the shortest period it takes to make a useful ASIC for a new cryptocurrency algorithm is about four months, although I would happily take expert input here. FPGAs in this example wouldn’t suffice, because the existence of ASICs at inception means there’s a relatively high bar to clear in terms of competitive hardware. Either way, the point remains — I fully expect that the first miners would be met with competition within six months at the latest.</p><h4>The ASICs in this example actually aren’t securities</h4><p>This isn’t exactly an objection but I wanted to address it anyway. I’ll admit I don’t know the answer here. You definitely have to mix the ASICs with your own labor (and electricity) to get a return, so their value doesn’t purely derive from the efforts of a third party. I am just vaguely guessing that the ASICs might resemble an investment contract. I am not a lawyer. This isn’t legal advice. Either way, if they weren’t securities, that would be even better for the model. We’re trying to avoid violating securities law, remember.</p><h4>The issuers are giving ASIC manufacturers total power. They could create extra ASICs and cheat the process</h4><p>This is definitely a risk, so the ASIC manufacturers must be contractually bound or closely trusted by the issuing team. The risk is that they covertly create too many ASICs. There are potential ways of mitigating this. I haven’t put a lot of thought into it, but I feel like the team could set up a protocol similar to google authenticator where they give miners ciphertext to include in coinbase outputs for the first few months, to ensure that the blocks being mined are being created only by ASICs which are accounted for. I’m not sure. I think someone clever could come up with a better way to ensure that only members of a permissioned set of ASICs is permitted to mine for the period in which they have a temporary monopoly.</p><h4>We don’t need any more blockchains. Stop helping people figure out how to issue new cryptocurrencies</h4><p>I basically agree, but I’m not going to stop exploring these issues just because you don’t like the idea of new coins existing. We may well discover a reason to create another blockchain at some point. Who knows.</p><h4>This launch is actually quite unfair, as you’re suggesting creating a premine</h4><p>Definitionally, this isn’t a premine. There is no “prior mine”. (I’ll admit that quibbling over definitions misses the point). What we have are the issuers monetizing their informational advantage. They know what hash function will be used, and they are selling that information in the form of purpose-built hardware. The mining is up to whoever the ASICs are sold to. They do get a temporary monopoly. Think of it like a taxi medallion which decomposes after six months. It’s clearly unfair. But having observed the Grin launch, and the ProgPoW debate, and the many Monero and Vertcoin “ASIC-resistance” hard forks, it’s very clear to me that developers are extremely susceptible to lobbying over PoW. I would prefer that the hash function is <em>never</em> changed, so that the rules of the game are fixed and the returns to lobbying are 0.</p><p>So in this case we have a <strong>transparently unfair<em> </em></strong>model, as contrasted with a (potential)<strong> covertly unfair<em> </em></strong>situation which people naively think is fair. The latter would be disastrous. Imagine a chain which was ASIC resistant, forked to a new PoW, for which it later emerged that the developers had custom-designed hardware, while everyone else mined with GPUs. This would constitute an exploitation of the community, and a breach of trust. This is entirely possible within the framework of ASIC-resistant coins, and I expect it to happen at some point. I’m proposing a situation with temporally limited unfairness, which decomposes over time, and becomes pretty explicitly fair thereafter.</p><h4>Developers shouldn’t monetize. They should work on these things altruistically. Otherwise you cannibalize intrinsic motivation</h4><p>I pretty much agree! I think that one of the most perverse outcomes with protocol-funded rewards is that FOSS developers lose their incentive to contribute to the protocol, leaving it all to the professionals who are paid directly from that protocol-funded spigot. This essentially turns a FOSS project into a corporate one, obviating all the advantages of using FOSS in the first place.</p><p>This specific configuration is a very limited monetization. The developers sell ASICs at the price that the market will tolerate, and that’s the only chance they have to directly monetize their protocol access. Later on, they can think about adopting the Red Hat/ COSS / Blockstream model, where they monetize their <em>protocol-specific expertise</em>. But this model also empowers the initial issuers/developers to exit the project without destroying it. Because they do not have permanent authority in the network, as would be the case with an issuing team retaining a large fraction of PoS tokens, for instance.</p><h4>Developers can’t sufficiently monetize under this configuration</h4><p>Excessive developer monetization of a monetary protocol they develop is a very dangerous thing, in my opinion. At a certain threshold you have an operation which is primarily dedicated to extracting rent, rather than delivering computational services at commodity prices. Anything developers to do abuse their authority in the system — including extracting value in excess of the minimum required (which may well be 0) — undermines its credibility and raises the likelihood of users leaving for a less extractive system. I am generally of the belief that no protocol-funded monetization whatsoever is optimal. But if there is to be some, I would tolerate it under the conditions that it is temporary, limited, and does not give the developers permanent authority within the system. This meets those restrictions.</p><h4>It’s too expensive to launch in this manner. Issuers won’t be able to sufficiently finance themselves</h4><p>This is a fair critique. Instead of creating the tokens for ~free and selling them, developers have to literally create hardware and sell it. ASICs are generally quite expensive. I suppose it might vary on the type, but a decent run will cost millions of dollars. So the issuers will need to be able to charge a sufficiently high price to extract a margin. This has the interesting effect of “pricing” the offering.</p><p>If the ASICs are expected to have a monopoly on issuance in the first six months, and 10 percent of supply will be issued in that period, the value of the fully diluted supply will roughly be 10 times what buyers pay for the ASICs. This establishes a floor for the required valuation of a project for issuers to be able to monetize in this manner. Let’s say it costs $5m to create a run of 1000 ASICs (it may well be much more — I don’t know much about hardware). Developers need to collect a decent chunk to finance R&amp;D, let’s say another $5m. So they need to be able to retail the ASICs for $10m collectively, or $10,000 each. Let’s also say they decide to issue 10% of supply in the first 6 months and they think the ASICs will hold up for that period. This means that the chain has to be priced by the market at a $100m valuation in the aggregate (at the time of the ASIC sale) for the issuers to collect sufficient margins.</p><h4>Why go through all this trouble to launch in this convoluted way? Why not just do an ICO and retain a treasury for long term incentive alignment?</h4><p>First of all, ICOs appear to be a violation of securities law in virtually every sensible jurisdiction. Going “offshore” probably won’t be enough, as many issuers will likely discover in 2020. This post is a proposal for an alternative to the PoW ‘fair’ launch, and the claim is that it improves along a couple directions. It’s not an alternative to ICOs. I believe that in today’s day and age (really anytime post the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/investreport/34-81207.pdf">SEC DAO Report</a> (released July 2017)), ICOs are largely unworkable from a regulatory perspective. Additionally, I think the ICO launch method will have a very hard time creating lasting monies.</p><p>This is still a hypothesis, but I strongly feel that the most important trait of a novel monetary system is a widely dispersed ownership. It starts with a GINI of 1 and its objective is to get to a reasonable level of dispersion with time. Now I don’t mean perfect equality of outcome — such a thing is impossible, and it’s unclear how that would even work. Every adult in 2019 receiving an equal entitlement to a share of the new monetary system? What about future humans? Unborn children? Even if mechanically possible, a global UBI would still be exposed to immense temporal contingency — privileging the interests of people today.</p><p>Airdrops don’t appear to work very well. Stellar’s attempt to distribute their coins as widely as possible has been a truly dismal failure. Something received for free tends not to be valued by the recipient. No surprise. Proof of Work is a potentially superior system. Miners must work for their share. They must commit time and effort to mining. This distribution method is truly underappreciated. If Ethereum succeeds, it will be in large part because it was mineable for 5+ years on commodity GPUs. Delaying the switch to PoS (which I argue above dulls the dispersion of coins) was a saving grace, in my opinion. As stated, this is still just an intuition. But I feel that PoW’s distributional qualities are very underrated. Many of these closely held monetary protocols will face the sisyphean task of getting users to store value in their currency.</p><h4>ASIC manufacturing is a concentrated industry where foundry allocations and political connections determine the winners. You are ensuring the ASIC manufacturers will be kingmakers here</h4><p>It’s true that cryptocurrency ASIC manufacturing is currently rather oligopolistic. For a rather eye-opening take on how the industry operates from a U.S. based ASIC manufacturer, read David Vorick’s <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b">take here</a>. What’s interesting about the ASIC launch is that is actually strips power from the big manufacturers like Bitmain, and restores it to the issuers of the coin. A fair GPU launch just sets of an arms race among the big ASIC manufacturers over who can build ASICs fastest. When they get there, they intensely lobby the team to not change the algo (see the ProgPoW debate in Ethereum).</p><p>In this situation, the team works with an ASIC manufacturer of their choice to create ASICs for launch, and ASIC manufacturers then have the opportunity to make chain-specific hardware subsequently. What is very clear is that the early returns to mining will not accrue to the big ASIC manufacturers. If they exist, they will accrue to the community members who purchased the ASICs from the issuers. This is overall a significant improvement. I’ll add that there’s an awkward transition that virtually every ASIC resistant chain has to and will make as they eventually capitulate and embrace ASICs. Choosing to trumpet ASIC resistance, coordinating a couple hard forks, and eventually accepting the inevitability of ASICs is to create a huge amount of ambiguity that ASIC manufacturers can and do exploit. I much prefer a game where the rules are explicit from day 0.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the possibility to create ASICs which aren’t as exposed to supply chain idiosyncrasies that SHA-256 ASICs currently require. The kingmakers for Bitcoin ASICs are the foundries, which privilege the big ASIC manufacturers who can pre-pay for access and compete for allocations. Some alternative technologies like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05193">optical Proof of Work</a> purport to inculcate a fairer ASIC manufacturing processes. I haven’t independently verified this, but this is the claim. If so, ASICs of that sort would be easier to mass-produce in a greater variety of settings.</p><h4>Any amount of seigniorage is disqualifying</h4><p>I am not entirely sure that I would call this seigniorage, as it’s entirely possible that ASIC buyers lose money and end up effectively paying $1.10 for each dollar that they mint. It’s not guaranteed seigniorage, at least. ASIC buyers are taking on a degree of risk. That said, if the model works well, ASIC buyers will be minting coins below market rate — if there wasn’t the possibility of doing that, they wouldn’t participate. So there is potential seigniorage. If you feel that even the slightest amount of seigniorage permanently ruins the credibility of the project, this model won’t work for you. But if you feel, as I do, that a small amount of seigniorage can be very useful, even if it trades off against credibility, you might find this model attractive.</p><h4>Why are you wasting your time thinking about this? We already have Bitcoin and we don’t need any new chains</h4><p>I reserve the right to think and write about whatever I find interesting!</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=cd6e8f06358f" width="1" height="1">
