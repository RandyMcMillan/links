  ♦<p>For centuries, production in capitalist countries seems to progress in some kind of “cycles”. Every few years, the economy experiences a period of sharp economic growth which is then upset by a collapse of businesses and a high unemployment rate — a recession. This cyclical movement of the market, repeatedly going from an economic boom to bust, is known as the “business cycle”. Social scientists of multiple disciplines have suggested numerous explanations for this phenomenon, from “under-consumption” to some psychological propensity. Yet, so far, no popular counter-measure pursued has solved this problem. Central banks have evidently failed to “cure” this alleged “market failure”, and despite the enormous, continuous growth in their power and influence, we once again seem to be at the beginning of a devastating recession.</p><p>Despite the confidence on the side of central bankers in their ability to handle this issue, it seems that, especially since the last crisis of 2008, the public is losing patience with the current system. People are getting fed up with footing the bill for the mistakes of the financial system, and very justly so. The scheme at work is already clear and visible. The economists grievously fail, and the taxpayer pays the costs (and their salaries)¹. It’s obvious that this system cannot continue. Yet, the right alternative — the solution — is still far from obvious. Nevertheless, the mainstream and most academia appear to agree on one thing, that money must be managed by the government, that is, through central planning.</p><p>They tend to look at the economy as a machine — some kind of a black box which is running on an engine fuelled by money. The more “fuel” you throw in, the quicker the engine will go, and the faster the economy will move. While the different economic schools and doctrines usually provide different theories and explanations, their practical controversies and disagreement are primarily around at what point injecting more “fuel” would cause the “machine” to run too fast, overheat and eventually blow up. That is, how much money would be too much for the economy and lead to problems or even to hyperinflation. Regardless of the many differences between the popular doctrines, the issue of money is where you will find their most enthusiastic agreement. The money supply² must always increase! Printing, bank credit expansion, “liquidity injection”, “quantitative easing”, public deficit spending, even outright handouts — just throw it out of a helicopter if that’s what it takes — but you must never let the inflow of money slow down!³</p><p>This approach of monetary “engineering” is undoubtedly the most popular, and has guided policies for more than a century. But, considering its failure to deliver on any of its promises⁴, there seems to be a good reason for questioning this approach. In fact, if there is anything to learn from the last hundred years, it is that government control over money, namely central banking, doesn’t promote prosperity. Expanding money and credit does not cure the problem of the business cycle (or any other issues for that matter) — this approach has failed every time. The common analogy that the economy is like a machine operated by the state fueling it with money might sound sensible to some, but does it really fit? Is the theory we have learned to accept, quite by default, actually correct?</p><p>In this article, I will present the “heterodox” approach of the “Austrian school” of economics. The Austrian school approaches the questions of economics from the view of individual actions and incentives, looking at the economy as an “organic” complex resulting from the many actions of individuals. Its theory of the business cycle is probably one of its central, though most controversial, achievements. The purpose of this article, however, is not merely to explain the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT), and certainly not to justify its validity. Many other books already provide such brilliant expositions⁵. The goal of this article is to discuss the possibility of economic reform which builds upon the theoretical works of the Austrian school. My aim here is to lay down the argument for how Bitcoin could be the key to preventing the business cycle — enabling greater and more sustainable economic growth.</p>Economic Growth<p>So to begin our discussion, we shall first look at how a healthy economy grows. Adam Smith, the “father of economics,” has attributed economic growth chiefly to the division of labor, that is, to the specialization of individuals in performing specific tasks. However, there is a much more critical aspect of human progress which Smith overlooked. As Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian school of economics explained, it is the availability of “factors of production,” that is capital, on which economic growth is dependent, and which also sets the limits for the division of labor.⁶</p><p>Capital, or capital goods, are the goods which are not used for direct consumption, but are used in the process of producing other goods, eventually reaching to consumers as “consumption goods.” Menger has explained this difference by referring to different “orders” of goods. The goods which consumers directly use, like food, clothes, and cars, are the goods of the “lowest, first order.” If we take bread, for instance, then we could say that flour is a “second-order” good in the process of producing it. Wheat can then be called a third-order good, and the land on which the wheat grew upon a fourth-order good. The order of a good is nothing inherent in it, but is rather “a product of reasoning” based on how a person intends to use it. Therefore, the same good can be of different orders when employed at different stages of production. The point here is, of course, not the assignment of the specific orders of goods, but understanding that production is a structure with varying “depth”. Furthermore, as we will now see, the higher the orders of goods we use in a production process get, that is, the “deeper” our production structure is, the more we will be able to produce.</p><p>As an example, consider a lumberjack cutting wood with an ax, as compared to another one which uses an electrical chainsaw. Clearly, the latter will be much more productive at his work, as the capital good he employs is much superior to the one used by the former lumberjack. But, it is no less clear that the chainsaw requires the employment of much higher order goods to assemble, its production process is longer and more complex. While an ax could be produced even by primitive people, from quite simple raw materials, the chainsaw requires the use of industrial equipment, like an engine and a power source, which by themselves require the use of many other goods, and so on. In other words, the chainsaw necessitates the accumulation of much (much) more capital and the use of much higher orders of goods to produce — it needs a “deeper” production structure.</p><p>Menger’s student, economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, has termed this property of increasing length and complexity of production, the “roundaboutness” of production processes. The more “roundabout” a production process is, the more and higher-order capital goods it means are employed. His choice of the term “roundabout” attempts to signify a crucial concept. To produce more and better consumer goods, we must first take the time to create more capital goods. By “deviating” from the straight line we wish to follow to get to our main goal of producing the final consumption goods (like firewood), taking the additional effort and going first to produce something else (the capital needed, like the ax or chainsaw), we can manufacture much better, or a greater quantity of, final products. The process of human progress, of improving welfare and material conditions of people, could most adequately be described as the process of capital accumulation. Our development and economic growth is dependent on and limited by the availability of capital goods for production. Thus, to understand the actual process of economic growth, the next step to look at is how capital accumulation works.</p><p>Accumulating capital means increasing the level of savings that a person holds. It means withholding consumption of goods and, instead, saving them and employing them in further production. When considering an individual working alone, like a fisherman building himself a fishing rod, the process of capital accumulation is quite straightforward. The fisherman delays his “production” of fish in the present and instead takes the time to build a fishing rod. He will need to postpone his consumption of fish while producing the rod but will later be able to use it to catch many more fish. Eventually, he will have more capital savings (the rod) and will be able to produce (fish) more efficiently. However, when discussed in the framework of the market economy, the process suddenly becomes much more “abstract” and harder to follow. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to understand the specifics of capital accumulation in the market economy.</p><p>The market economy is a system of the division of labor. It is a “framework” in which private individuals own capital, exchange goods and services, and cooperate to achieve their ends. Its most important property is the existence of a pricing system for all traded products and services, denominated in a common medium of exchange — money. Therefore, the allocation of capital in the market economy is done mostly by using the money prices of goods.</p><p>Most people tend to confuse money and money prices. When we say, for instance, that our lumberjack saved 100$ by producing firewood, what we mean is that he created something priced on the market as worth 100$. If he decided to use the firewood for consumption, he may do so either directly — for example by using it to make fire, or indirectly, by selling it for 100$ of cash, spending that on something he will actually consume. If, however, he prefers to increase his savings, he could refrain from consuming the wood, storing it for later, or using it to make new work tools (capital). Or again, as the usual course of the market economy goes, he could sell it for cash, and either save that money to spend later, spend it now on buying more capital goods to use, or lend it to or invest it in some enterprise. The more capital goods people accumulate, either directly by owning them, or indirectly, through money savings, lending, and investing, the more will the economy progress.⁷</p><p>As we now see, the most important force of economic growth is saving and accumulating capital, which requires deferring consumption of the goods produced. Therefore, we now face a new question. How long will a man be willing to defer his consumption in order first to accumulate more capital? In other words, how does a man, and eventually the economy as a whole, decide the length of production? That is, whether to focus on short term production of relatively fewer consumer goods sooner, or longer-term production, employing more “roundabout” processes to produce more (or better) consumption goods later.</p><p>The answer is that people decide according to their time preference. It is a generally accepted⁸ that all else being equal, a person will always prefer to satisfy his needs sooner rather than later (as for every person time is finite and the future is uncertain). This means that, for people to defer their present consumption, the future output expected from taking longer (more roundabout) production efforts must be high enough to compensate for this delay in consumption. Put simply, people value time, they prefer to attain their ends sooner rather than later, and the extent to which they value the present more than the future is their level of time preference.</p><p>Having high time preference, a person will be less willing to defer his consumption, and will be more present-oriented in his economic activity. In contrast, a person with lower time preference will prefer to wait longer and take more roundabout processes, as they will sufficiently compensate him for the increase in production length. We may say that the time preference of people is what regulates the length of production in the economy.</p><p>The lower time preference is, the more future-oriented people are, and the more capital they save and accumulate to enhance productivity and develop the economy.⁹</p><p>Again, in the case of an isolated economy of a single individual, there will not be much further question of how the process goes. In such a case, the same person does everything by himself. Just to clarify, retaking the example of a fisherman, if his time preference is relatively high, we will not be willing to defer his consumption to make the fishing rod first. However, if he has a low enough time preference, he will prefer this more “roundabout’’ process of making the fishing rod while catching no fish at first and then use it to increase his productivity. But as we said before, the process looks different when we introduce the division of labor of the market economy. In the market, production is directed according to consumers’ demand¹⁰, reflected through the price system.</p><p>Time is a factor of production. In fact, it is the only factor of production without which no production is possible. As such, time, that is, the time preference of the consumers, also has its money price in the market, namely, the interest rate. The interest rate is the price required to withhold capital from others for a certain time¹¹. As people save more, thus lower their time preference, it means that they are willing to delay their consumption for a lower “compensation”¹² compared to what they used to, and will accordingly offer their funds at a lower cost (interest rate).</p><p>As the interest rate gets lower, capital becomes cheaper for entrepreneurs to obtain. Projects which were previously too long or too capital intensive to be profitable suddenly become viable investments, as more capital is available at lower costs. Thus entrepreneurs will find it profitable to expand their businesses and open new initiatives, and consequently will expand and deepen the production structure by taking more roundabout production processes. What happens is that, by taking on more loans (or investments) from savers, entrepreneurs will be able to purchase the capital saved by the people who lowered their time preference (as lower time preference means more saving). This is how new capital accumulated gets into the production structure of the market economy, how resources are mobilized and the division of labor taking place. Prices serve as the guiding indicator for producers in the market economy, and the price of time, the interest rate, serves as an especially important indicator, as it is present in all imaginable processes of production and regulates their length and use of the available resources.</p><p>As these more roundabout processes of production mature, there will be a greater supply of goods (could be both capital and consumption goods) in the economy. People will then be able to lower their time preference and increase their savings without diminishing (or even while increasing) consumption. In a sense, there is a positive feedback loop, where lower time preference and longer-term view allows production to expand, eventually making more goods available, allowing to reduce time preference even further and so on. This is the process of civilization, by which humans have raised themselves from poverty and destitution to the modern prosperity, relative to past generations, that we have today.</p>♦The Business Cycle<p>So far, we have not seen any issue which should lead to the appearance of the business cycle — the recurring periods of great economic boom followed by a collapse of projects throughout the whole economy. So now we shall turn to our main problem here, what, indeed, is the cause of the business cycle?</p><p>According to the Austrian theory, developed initially by Böhm-Bawerk’s student, economist Ludwig von Mises, the root of the problem is to be found in the intervention of governments and central banks with the money supply, more accurately, with their efforts to increase the money supply and expand credit.¹³ In simple terms, what credit expansion means here is the creation of money, out of thin air.¹⁴ There are many ways today by which governments aim to expand credit, like Quantitative Easing, fractional reserve banking¹⁵ — which is insured by the taxpayer (implicitly or explicitly) and fully regulated by the state, and various other accounting schemes and financial “tools.” Still, the essence of all those schemes is to increase the supply of money and credit in the economy, essentially out of thin air.</p><p>So what are the effects of such credit expansion on the process of economic progress we have discussed thus far? The initial effect from such credit expansion will be a drop in the interest rate. As the new money finds its way to (or, as usually happens, originates in) the banking system, banks will be in a position to offer cheaper loans, simply from having a greater supply of money available. This reduction of the interest rate has, for a long time, been the main (declared) objective of governments when pursuing credit expansion.</p><p>As we have seen, a lower (natural) interest rate is indeed correlated with economic growth, as it reflects lower time preference. From this, many economists have taken the leap to the conclusion that a lower interest rate promotes economic growth, and that it is therefore the government’s responsibility to push it as low as possible. However, we know that the interest rate is not like a metric on a machine, it is the reflection of the time preference of people. Attempting to promote economic growth by lowering the interest rate with credit expansion is like trying to “promote” rain by pushing down the pointer on a barometer. You will achieve nothing more than rendering the barometer defective and cause those who rely on it to make wrong projections. This is exactly what happens with the interest rate. As we said, entrepreneurs and businessmen rely on the interest rate to determine the length and complexity of their production efforts. The interest rate is their indication for how much capital is available to use for production. As central banks lower the interest rate, it lures entrepreneurs into expanding production and to commit to more roundabout processes than they otherwise would have taken. It distorts the economic data guiding entrepreneurs, leading them to make systematic errors, and ultimately misallocating capital.</p><p>At first, the expansion in production will cause an apparent economic boom, with more businesses opening, new constructions launching, wages rising and a general increase in economic activity. Nevertheless, this economic boom is necessarily unsustainable, as it relies on a defecting indicator for capital availability — the artificially low interest rate.</p><p>The essential problem caused by the artificially low interest rate is that it creates the illusion that there is more capital available for production than there really is. A “real” drop in the interest rate comes from a drop in the time preference of people, from the greater accumulation and saving of capital. The price system is the information system of the market economy, and the interest rate is the indicator informing entrepreneurs of changes in savings, in the capital available for production. However, when the government artificially lowers the interest rate, there is no change in the available capital. People did not reduce their consumption, nor did they increase their savings in any other way. There is no new capital to use in production, but with the artificially lower interest rate, entrepreneurs already rely on the existence of such additional capital in order to complete their expanded production processes. In other words, the increase in production started during the boom is unsustainable, it is impossible to complete, and will therefore have to end with a collapse.</p><p>But let us take a moment to see what this process would actually look like. With lower interest rates, as we said, entrepreneurs will expand production. They will take on new loans and use them to buy more capital goods. Now, since the supply of capital did not increase, but the demand for it from entrepreneurs rose, the prices of capital goods will have to rise to match the new demand. As the prices of the higher order goods rise, entrepreneurs will be forced to take new loans to obtain the capital they need to complete production. There will be a higher demand for loans and the interest rate, still artificially low, will be pushed back to the level where it corresponds to the true time preference of people. With the interest rate back up, and with the prices of capital goods adjusted to the new money supply, the shortage of capital to complete all production becomes apparent. The submarginal projects started during the boom, or malinvestments, as Mises called them, will again appear as unprofitable and will have to be liquidated. The final result of this process is a massive collapse of businesses across all the economy and a consequent high unemployment, that is, a recession.</p><p>During the recession, malinvestments are liquidated, and the capital invested in them is either lost or reallocated to more profitable projects. The recession is, in a sense, the re-adjustment of the market to the real capital and time preference of people. It is the market curing itself and recovering, wiping out the mistakes made on the basis of distorted information, stopping to waste scarce capital on unrealisable projects, and reallocating capital based on the corrected information.</p><p>In short, the business cycle is a period of unsustainable expanded production, induced by lower interest rates, followed by the realization that the expanded production is unsustainable, and the consequent collapse of businesses.</p>♦<p>So what can we do to stop the recession? Unfortunately, once credit expansion has started causing the illusory economic boom, the eventual bust is inevitable. Capital is being wasted, and there is no way to make such malinvestments truly sustainable. Yet, basing their efforts on a different theory, governments and central banks still believe it is possible to artificially “combat” the recession by accelerating credit expansion even further. However, their repeated failures to handle those cycles leaves us a very good reason to question their theories and approach.</p><p>If the government pushes credit expansion even further, it will be able to reduce the interest rate again, essentially returning us to the first step of the cycle, but with the malinvestments made continuing to waste additional capital. Still, it is crucial to understand that they cannot do this forever. The boom is unsustainable, and preserving the malinvestments it induced by lowering interest rates at an accelerating pace will not change this fact, but only postpone it from being exposed, further delaying an amplified and inescapable market adjustment. Eventually, either capital is exhausted or a hyper-inflation ensues.¹⁶ Delaying the bust only aggravates the issue, causing a greater bust later, as it allows malinvestments to continue to waste scarce capital.</p><p>As the cycle becomes inevitable once the interest rate is distorted, the only way to stop the business cycle is to prevent interest rate manipulations. That is, we must prevent credit expansion from taking place. This is the approach taken by the Austrian economists, of which many, including Mises himself, suggested such reforms for preventing credit expansion. These were usually along the lines of returning to a rigid gold standard, having free market competition in money, or making large banking reforms, but among all their proposals, two, unfortunately contradictory, things are common.</p><p>First is their goal — their essence is limiting the power of governments and their control over money and credit. Second is their practical approach, which essentially amounts to limiting the government’s power *by asking the government* to limit itself. Such a thing is quite unprecedented. Governments will not voluntarily reduce their power over anything, nor will they admit of making such a huge mistake as causing business cycles for so many years, as adopting any such proposal must mean.</p><p>Many of the Austrian economists have realised this fault in their works to achieve any practical result, which led Friedrich A. Hayek, Mises’s most well-known student, to the following conclusion:</p><blockquote>“I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop.” — F. A. Hayek</blockquote><p>This is precisely where Bitcoin comes in. While Hayek’s quote is from 1984, about two and a half decades before Bitcoin was invented, hardly anyone has ever described Bitcoin better than that. The idea of Bitcoin, as Satoshi wrote, is to create “a peer to peer electronic cash system”. That is, money which is operated by a global and open network, without depending on any central authority. No single participant or a specific group is necessary for operating Bitcoin — no one can shut it down, because there is no one Bitcoin depends on to continue to work. It is as Hayek said, a system which takes “the thing” (money) out of the hands of government, and that they can’t stop.¹⁷</p><p>This is the most important difference between Bitcoin and gold, which most Austrians still currently endorse. The gold standard was operated by governments and banks, and cannot work without such a system of a few central institutions holding most of the gold reserves. Without such a system, all gold payments will have to be physically delivered. Such an option was already impractical decades ago, but today, with all the digital payments made, it is just unthinkable. This means that the gold standard can only function if approved by governments, but is doomed as soon as the political attitude shifts unfavourably. It is this very weakness of the gold standard that enabled governments to effectively confiscate it (Executive Order 6102) and eventually completely remove it (Executive Order 11615). This weakness of gold is what Bitcoin aims to fix. It is “an unstoppable force” — money which does not ask for permission from politicians to operate.</p>Bitcoin and the Business Cycle<p>But assuming for a moment the use of Bitcoin as money, there is still the question of how would it help prevent the business cycle? Bitcoin has a few notable attributes in this regard.</p><p>First, Bitcoin has a predetermined fixed supply limit. It is produced by a mechanism of proof of work, a digital “gold mining” like process, and limited to 21 million units ever to be created. This is slightly different from gold, where mining can continue to unknown extent, but the important property they share is that their supply cannot be manipulated by government decree. No paper signed by politicians could make more Bitcoin or gold appear, unlike the system of fiat money we have today. This means that, with Bitcoin, governments will not be able to inflate the base supply of money. This is the first necessary step towards limiting credit expansion in the economy. But, while necessary, it is not enough by itself, as it still does not directly limit the ability of banks to expand credit.</p><p>This leads us to the second important way by which Bitcoin could help prevent the business cycle, and on which we have already touched briefly. It is the fact that Bitcoin works without intermediaries, it is peer to peer cash. It allows people to hold their money by themselves, without having to give (more correctly, lend)¹⁸ it to a bank to be able to make transactions. This will ensure a clear separation between money held by individuals for their regular expenses (as cash balances), and the money they wish to save and can be invested productively in the economy through the banking system. In other words, it could limit the part of the money, the reserves, held by banks, thus limiting their power to excessively expand credit. When people can use their money — without relying on financial institutions to make the transactions — they can choose what amount they wish to hold themselves to transact from, and what they prefer to save and invest in the economy, and entrust banks with managing the latter. Such a system will make sure that the supply of money and money substitutes (credit) in circulation remains stable, preventing credit expansion and the consequent business cycle.</p><p>Even if banking for “demand deposits”, that is for money held for regular expenses, continues, the fact that Bitcoin has a rigid supply will force banks to be responsible with their credit issuance or they will risk a bank run. Furthermore, since Bitcoin is a digital asset, it is much cheaper to store, verify and transfer than with physical assets. That is, Bitcoin does not need a Fort Knox to benefit from economies of scale in storing and handling it. Therefore, the barriers of entrance for new competing banks will be lower, and there will be better grounds for free competitive banking. This improved competition could force banks to be more responsible in managing reserves¹⁹, thus limiting credit expansion more effectively even in such a “free banking” scenario.</p>The Road Ahead<p>Now that we see the main economic reason for transitioning to Bitcoin, we can discuss how such a transition could take place. In fact, I would argue that this transition has already started. In just about a decade, Bitcoin has grown from being a mere idea on a mailing list to a global network serving millions of people, having cleared trillions of dollars worth of transactions. Many businesses have already started accepting it, people are hodling it, and we may even say that there is a new, alternative, financial system already developing around it. Despite the impression some people get from its short-term price volatility, the trend is clear, Bitcoin is going forward. It is not waiting for politicians to approve it (like gold or Libra do), or central bankers to adopt it, or for “economists” to embrace it — it is growing in spite of their current objections.</p><p>This present trend though is by no means inevitable. While it is unlikely that Bitcoin itself can be stopped, its adoption could very well be. In the end, Bitcoin is just a tool available for people, but it is the public which decides if they wish to pick it up and use it. Like with all other economic and political changes, the success of Bitcoin depends on public opinion. It is not enough that we have Bitcoin if people don’t see its benefits, or refuse to use it. Unfortunately, the most prevalent views of today, both in economics and politics, see Bitcoin as useless, harmful and even “evil”. The idea of money not controlled by the state is rejected by all popular doctrines of today, and the only view somewhat receptive to it, that of the Austrian school, has been on the losing side of public opinion for many decades.</p><p>However, it seems that together, by combining Austrian economics as a theoretical framework, with Bitcoin as the practical approach, we could have an incredible opportunity to sway public opinion. While the Austrian framework provides the theoretical explanations of the benefits of having sound, hard money, Bitcoin demonstrates them in reality. And while it is unclear what further consequences would result from adopting Bitcoin, the Austrian approach to economics can clarify that. The Austrian view is the only one which is able to provide an explanation for the success of Bitcoin, and even simply for its existence. In other words, Bitcoin exposes the public to the possibility of having a different kind of money, not controlled by the state, while the Austrian theory explains why such money can be so beneficial and desirable. Every day in which Bitcoin continues to operate is a slap in the face of the mainstream economists. It is a living proof that their theories might not be right after all. That the free market does not need the state to set and manage the money, and can produce a better monetary system by itself.</p>Conclusions<p>To briefly summarise, the unique properties of Bitcoin — being digital, peer to peer, unstoppable hard money, have the potential to make a real transformation in the economy, preventing the business cycle and allowing for sustainable economic growth.</p><p>For millennia, governments were entrusted to manage the money for their citizens, but history is flooded with examples where this power was abused.²⁰ While in the past, such abuses were shameful acts committed secretly by rulers against their citizens (like coin clipping), today — in the age of populism — the rulers are no longer ashamed of it, but to the contrary, they proudly announce those acts, backed by the “intelligentsia” providing excuses for how this is done “for the people” to “stimulate the economy”.</p><p>As Mise explained on the essence of sound money:</p><blockquote>“It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights. The demand for constitutional guarantees and for bills of rights was a reaction against arbitrary rule and the non-observance of old customs by kings. The postulate of sound money was first brought up as a response to the princely practice of debasing the coinage. It was later carefully elaborated and perfected in the age which — through the experience of the American Continental Currency, the paper money of the French Revolution and the British Restriction period — had learned what a government can do to a nation’s currency system.” — Ludwig von Mises</blockquote><p>Money is the backbone of the market economy, it is what coordinates the action of everyone, which is why it must be neutral — resistant to manipulations and forced debasements. It is time that we take the thing out of the hands of the state, back into the hands of the people. It’s time to move to Bitcoin.</p><p>[1]: There are enumerable examples of such cases, just for example: Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Yellen’s contradictory statements: 1, 2 Economist J.

  ♦The Growing Relevance of Decentralization to Law<p>In recent years, “decentralization” has become an important concept for purposes of the law. Consider:</p><ul><li>Regulators such as the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have recognized that the applicability of financial regulations to blockchain systems can depend on the degree of control people have over them, with certain regulations being inapplicable when a system is “sufficiently decentralized” or “non-custodial”.</li><li>U.S. politicians have even learned to discern among decentralized cryptocurrencies and centralized cryptocurrencies, and to view the centralized solutions with more skepticism, as evinced in the U.S. Congress’s recent hearings on Facebook’s Project Libra.</li><li>Courts have held that the decentralized, trust-reduced nature of blockchain systems can affect how property laws and tort claims are interpreted — for example, the information in blockchain systems can form a foundation for property rights in tokens such as Bitcoin, even though information is typically not treated as property in other contexts.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, lawyers, regulators and politicians might not always fully understand or explain what they mean by “decentralized”, nor why they believe decentralization has legal significance. Worse still, there is not even a clear non-legal meaning of “decentralization”. Some argue that even fully read-/write-unpermissioned blockchains like Bitcoin are not decentralized, while others have argued that blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are truly decentralized but other systems (like enterprise blockchains) are not.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to remind people that understanding when a system is decentralized for legal purposes is a critical task, to explain in more detail what I think a reasonable legal test of “decentralization” will look like and to encourage other attorneys and technologists to work on this important issue.</p>Why Do We Need a Legal Test for Decentralization?<p>Much has already been written about why the law does apply or should apply differently to decentralized systems than centralized systems. Thus, I will not attempt an in-depth policy justification of that position here, but for the most part will simply assume it is true. For those who may doubt the premise, I would suggest reviewing some or all of the resources listed under the endnotes for this article.</p><p>Assuming the law applies differently to a “sufficiently decentralized” system than to a centralized system, it is imperative that lawyers, judges, regulators and others involved in the legal industry develop a common understanding of what “decentralization” means. Otherwise, they will not know how to apply the law. I believe that a test for when a system is decentralized will be the best way of creating a consistent understanding.</p>A Legal Philosophy Interlude — Principles vs. Standards vs. Rules<p>The task of explicitly building the concept of “decentralization” into law could be approached in various ways, each of which has pros and cons.</p><p>The pros and cons of formulating laws as principles, standards or rules have been discussed extensively in legal philosophy generally, as well as specifically in the context of securities law reform. Although the subject is nuanced, in general it may be said that:</p><ul><li>A principles-based approach is the most flexible and likely to yield consistently sound results, but is slow and provides little ex ante certainty to market participants.</li><li>A standards-based approach is slightly less flexible while still having many of the advantages of a principles-based approach, but provides more clarity and predictability — though still typically will require extensive and costly legal analysis (the “Howey test” being a great example).</li><li>A rule-based approach is the most clear and provides the most ex ante certainty with the lowest transaction costs, but therefore must also be the most conservative and probably yield many ‘false negatives’ — i.e., proscribing activity that would be considered legitimate under a more principles-based or standards-based approach.</li></ul><p>The best legal systems combine the strengths of all three approaches to the law. U.S. securities laws provide an excellent example of this tripartite strategy. For example:</p><ul><li>Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ’33 Act) exempts from SEC registration requirements “transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering”;</li><li>standards and practices about the meaning of “public offering” developed over some decades, through court opinions, regulatory action and consensus of the legal profession; and</li><li>in 1982, the SEC implemented Regulation D as a bright-line, non-exclusive “safe harbor” defining some clear circumstances in which a securities offering would not be deemed a “public offering” — such as a sale only to accredited investors.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that, in this evolution from principles to standards to rules, the rules do not override the standards, and the standards do not override the principles. Instead, all three forms of law remain available to market participants, who may select among them depending on their needs and risk appetite. A market participant who is highly risk-averse or cannot afford (in time and/or money) the costs of a very bespoke approach will opt to take advantage of the bright-line safe harbor rule. A more sophisticated market participant can, if they so wish, retain advisors to help them structure an offering that is legally compliant when considered in light of the deeper principles and policy considerations embodied in the statute.</p><p>My contention is that it should also be the same way with determining the law around “decentralization.” First, we need a flexible, rich and nuanced jurisprudential standard for assessing when a system may be sufficiently decentralized. Then, Goodhart’s law notwithstanding, there should also be a clear, bright-line “safe harbor” encompassing a subset of systems for which it is particularly obvious that they are decentralized, and market participants who wish to do so should be able to follow the conservative path set out in that safe harbor without fear of legal reprisals.</p><p>In this article I will attempt to propose both a more flexible standard and a bright-line safe harbor for assessing whether a blockchain system is decentralized as a matter of law.</p>A Taxonomy of Blockchain Power Forms<p>In order to determine whether a blockchain system is “decentralized,” we must first itemize the various potential forms of power over a blockchain system. Only if control over each of them is “decentralized” should the system as a whole be considered to be clearly and indisputably “decentralized” as a matter of law.</p><p>1. Validation Power</p><p>Validation power refers to the ability of persons participating in or relying on the network to read and validate its data. Aside from certain read-permissioned enterprise blockchain systems, the validation power of most blockchain systems is decentralized because the blockchain data is freely accessible to anyone through the peer-to-peer network and uses a cryptographic scheme that enables any person with the right software and understanding to independently verify the validity of state changes by running the data through cryptographic checks. Decentralization of validation power also requires that all relevant software code be publicly available for review and operation.</p><p>Since decentralization is not all-or-nothing, some blockchain systems may decentralize validation power better than others. A blockchain system with serious “state bloat” may require such a large amount of data to be downloaded and validated, or the state transition rules may be so computationally challenging, that only enterprise-grade computer systems are up to the task. The validation power of such a blockchain system is still decentralized, but not as decentralized as in a system that is more lightweight and can be affordably and quickly validated by consumer-grade equipment. Validation power on the system with heavier state should be considered to be less decentralized than on the system with lighter state, but may still be sufficiently decentralized for purposes of the law.</p><p>2. Consensus Power</p><p>Consensus power refers to the ability of persons to write data to the blockchain. To write data to the blockchain is typically a two-step process: (1) a properly formed proposal to add a block must be made; and (2) that proposal must be accepted by the other nodes on the network in accordance with the consensus protocol embodied in the software client(s) those nodes are running.</p><p>Because Step 2 (accepting blocks) is essentially automatic and passive, Step 1 (proposing valid blocks) is the primary vector for potential “attacks” on the system. Thus, most protocols permission the power to propose blocks:</p><ul><li>In open proof-of-work-based systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.x, block production is permissioned by the protocol’s requirement that valid block proposals be accompanied by a hash meeting certain criteria, which can only be generated by running real-time computations on expensive computer hardware. Yet, anyone who has such hardware can propose a block— they do not need to be accepted into the network based on identity.</li><li>Delegated-proof-of-stake blockchains such as EOS and Cosmos protect against sybil attacks by only allowing a finite number of identified block proposers who are elected to serve that role. Their permissioning is identity-based and election-based.</li><li>Direct proof-of-stake systems use a stake-weighted random block proposer and validator function, which allows them to have an indefinite number of potential block proposers whose incentives are secured by their stakes. Overall permissioning takes the form of having put up stake, and per-block permissioning takes the form of randomness.</li></ul><p>Since the power to propose blocks is, in one sense or another, permissioned, it is also scarce and therefore valuable. Therefore, the circumstantial prerequisites of block proposal power may be analogized to ownership of the “means of production” within traditional capitalist economies — a “means of block production,” as it were.</p><p>When a single person or group of affiliated persons controls a very large percentage of the means of block production, that person or group also controls the consensus power of the network for most practical purposes, because the blocks proposed by that person or group will outpace those proposed by a minority of block producers and will be accepted and added to the blockchain automatically by the other nodes on the network in accordance with the consensus rules. This gives rise to the notion that consensus attacks on a blockchain, such as the notorious “double spend,” are possible.</p><p>The possibility that some person or affiliated group of persons could dominate consensus power reveals that, at least in the short term, the integrity of all blockchain systems depends on an honest “majority” assumption. Depending on the architecture of the protocol, “majority” may mean different things — in some cases even control of less than 50% of the means of block production can effectively provide control over the blockchain system. For example, on the EOS protocol, an honest majority means 2/3rds of block producers are honest, so control of 34% of the block producers would be enough to credibly threaten a consensus attack.</p><p>For a blockchain system to be considered legally decentralized, the consensus power, and thus the means of block production, should be decentralized. For example, on EOS, 2/3rds of block producers should be not only honest in practice, but also unaffiliated such that the honesty of each must be and can be tested separately. If it turned out that 2/3rds of EOS block producers were all entities owned by the same parent corporation (or were otherwise closely affiliated — for example, operating under a joint venture agreement providing for shared governance and incentives), the consensus power on EOS would not be decentralized.</p><p>Decentralization of consensus power may be less important technically and economically than it is legally. It has been persuasively argued that consolidation of hashpower in proof-of-work systems is unlikely in itself to result in consensus attacks, because the block producers, although powerful, have strong incentives to preserve the value of their capital by maintaining the integrity and neutrality of the system. This could be considered a reason why decentralization of consensus power is not important in assessing when a system is sufficiently decentralized as a matter of law.</p><p>For purposes of the law, however, this pragmatic consideration has limited implications. Regulatory law is paranoid and proactive. Thus, it does not merely seek to punish bad behavior by the powerful after they have abused their power, but should impose disclosure and compliance obligations to prevent harm by those who are particularly well positioned to inflict it. For example, under SEC rules, directors and officers of public corporations are not only required to disclose their bad conduct, but are required to disclose their structural conflicts of interest and lawful self-interested transactions.</p><p>From a purely legal standpoint, regulations or heightened duties of disclosure and care should apply to affiliated miners or other types of block producers who dominate the consensus power of a network to the point where they could inflict significant damage if they wanted to, even if they have good incentives and in practice have not (so far) abused their power. Thus, consensus power should always be considered in assessing decentralization.</p><p>However, in systems with otherwise good cryptoeconomic incentives (such as the non-repurposable sunk capital costs assumed by PoW ASIC miners), concentration of consensus power may be the least worrisome form of concentration of power. Thus, it may be that there can be significant concentration of consensus power, but the system as a whole may still be decentralized if there is competition for the means of block production and the persons who own the means of block production do not also possess a significant amount of other forms of power over the system.</p><p>3. Protocol/Client Power</p><p>Protocol power refers to the ability of persons to define or influence the blockchain system’s protocol.The protocol is comprised of various rules and procedures, including rules and procedures for determining which version of the blockchain is considered canonical, the circumstances under which new tokens can be minted, the validity and ordering of transactions, the range of allowable scripting logic and other matters defining how the blockchain system should operate.</p><p>Client power refers to the ability of persons to change the code of the software clients run by nodes on the network. Client power is closely related to protocol power, because the protocol must be expressed and implemented in the code of the software clients. People who wish to transact on the network must either download and run these clients or (via APIs) route transactions through others who have done so.</p><p>Protocol power and client power are theoretically separate. In Bitcoin, BIP 0014 introduced a distinction between the Bitcoin protocol and the dominant Bitcoin client, Bitcoin Core — a distinction that is expressed by creating a separate versioning scheme for the protocol. In practice, however, protocol power and client power tend to blur. For example, the Bitcoin Wiki’s entry on protocol documentation states that “[t]he Bitcoin protocol is specified by the behavior of the reference client,” and the reference client is defined as Bitcoin Core.</p><p>Although nodes on Bitcoin and Ethereum are in fact using a variety of clients, each network has a clear dominant client — Bitcoin Core in the case of Bitcoin and Go-Ethereum (Geth) in the case of Ethereum. Developers for these “core” clients have the most funding and influence. Maintainers of the minority clients tend to make conforming changes from the core client without significant political debate. I am unaware of any past situation in which the maintainers of the minority clients, for political or philosophical reasons, affirmatively refused to adopt a protocol change that was implemented by the maintainers of the dominant client. Accordingly, for purposes of testing decentralization, I will discuss protocol/client power as a single form of power.</p><p>Protocol/client power tends to be permissioned. For example, only a few individuals have “merge authority” over the official code repositories for Bitcoin Core and Geth. These persons are typically referred to as “core ‘developers,” and I will adopt this terminology going forward. Most of the time, core developers are not expressly acting agents or fiduciaries of any other person in pursuing their core development work, meaning that they can make changes to the client at their discretion. On the other hand, those individuals may also be funded by other sources of potential centralization — for example, by a “Foundation” which controls all or most of the capital generally available for funding development. These funding relationships may create agency-like pressures on core developers even if there is no formal or legal agency relationship.</p><p>Because protocol/client power is held by core developers, such power may superficially appear very centralized. However, there are at least two very important checks and balances on such power: (1) the clients for most blockchains (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) are open-source software; and (2) with certain exceptions (such as Tezos), the core developers do not have the power to push a client update to the nodes running the client on the network or otherwise compel persons running nodes to adopt a client update.</p><p>The combination of these two factors means that the broader community of people running nodes on the network — including miners, cryptocurrency exchanges, hobbyists, dApp providers and others, who for simplicity I refer to collectively as “users”—also have power. The users must (again, with certain exceptions, such as Tezos) voluntarily and affirmatively accept any new version of the client, and (in theory) have a viable alternative to doing so: They can continue to run the prior version of the open-source client, or can modify the new version of the open-source client to remove any changes that are objectionable and run that modified version. I refer to this countervailing power as “user power,” which is analyzed in a separate section below.</p><p>The nuances involved in measuring protocol/client power do not end at pointing out the balance between core developer power and user power. Even without taking user power into account, client/protocol power may be more decentralized if the core developers receive funding from various unaffiliated sources (rather than a single Foundation) and the commit process involves a complicated multisig scheme where keys are held by unaffiliated individuals.</p><p>The existence of multiple clients, while it has not to date been a significant catalyst of protocol politics, may operate as a subtle constraint on the discretion of the core developers, since if the maintainers of another client that has substantial popularity dissent, there is a risk of a contentious protocol fork and thus also a contentious network/chain fork.</p><p>Fear of potential legal liability for causing users to lose funds, though it has yet to be tested by the courts, likely operates as a similar subtle constraint, which core developers have sometimes expressed being conscious of. Core developers will also tend to care about their reputations, which would be harmed by bad conduct or mistakes.</p><p>Just as protocol/client power can be less centralized than it superficially appears, user power may not be as effective of a counterbalancing force in practice as it is in theory. The damage users can suffer from a contentious protocol/network fork mean that those who would like to dissent from a protocol/client upgrade must weigh the value of their dissent against its cost. If the name of the system and/or ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency are trademarked and that trademark is owned by, say, a Foundation, that Foundation has very potent protocol/client power, because it gets to decide legally which version of the protocol/client can use the trademark.</p><p>Accordingly, only protocol/client upgrades which are either extremely objectionable to a minority-in-power of users, or are (weakly or strongly) opposed by a majority-in-power of users, will fail to be adopted. Moreover, core developers are free to bundle protocol/client changes together so that users who object to one aspect of the changes will still accept the new version because they agree with other aspects. Finally, many users may be uninformed or apathetic — the classic ‘free rider’ problem — yet, unlike passive stockholders in a corporation, do not have ‘representatives’ advocating for their interest in a fiduciary relationship. These types of factors subtly constrain user power and make user adoption of a client upgrade, by itself, an inadequate measure of protocol/client consensus and legitimacy. Thus, in systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, core developers’ power is checked by user power only in extreme cases, which is not as good for decentralization as if user power were a potent check on core developer power across the full spectrum of potential protocol/client changes.</p><p>Arguably, separation of concerns — separating the governance mechanism from the upgrade mechanism — could deliver better decentralization of protocol/client power. As noted above, Tezos is dissimilar to Bitcoin and Ethereum inasmuch as it allows protocol/client updates to be ‘pushed’ to users, which in itself would seem to be an indicator of centralization. This might make Tezos look more centralized, but Tezos has other checks on protocol/client power — including a less clear division between core and non-core developers and a token-voting mechanism for approving client upgrades. However, the Tezos approach has other disadvantages and has sometimes been described as plutocratic, because it shrinks the class of “users” (as I have defined it) to token holders only, and thus risks sacrificing the possibility of richer political debates accompanying a proposed protocol/client change. For more on this issue, see under “User Power” below.</p><p>4. Economic Power</p><p>Economic power refers to the ability of persons to affect token price through the funding of research and development or token trading activity.</p><p>Although economic power may sound complex and difficult to measure, in practice I believe the main sources of economic power are ownership/control of a sizable percentage of the blockchain system’s native token and ownership/control of capital that was raised and set aside for research, development and/or marketing purposes by selling the token in an ICO, IEO or other similar investment scheme.</p><p>An example of a blockchain system with highly concentrated economic power would be MakerDAO, because the Maker Foundation has sold MKR tokens to investors, controls the capital from such sales, controls a substantial percentage of MKR tokens and through such MKR tokens controls parameters of the system that can auction new MKR tokens at any price. An example of a system with somewhat more decentralized economic power would be ZCash, where the development fund is co-governed by a non-profit Foundation and a for-profit technology company, which are legally required to be unaffiliated under the terms of their agreements, and the spending of the fund is managed by a board which is additionally required to have representation that is independent from both the Foundation and the technology company. (Incidentally, the ZCash trademark and logo are also jointly owned by the Foundation and technology company.)</p><p>Of all the forms of power over a blockchain system, economic power is the most potent, because it overlaps with the other forms of power. In proof-of-stake systems, economic power may overlap substantially with consensus power. If a person with substantial economic power over a proof-of-work system also has substantial consensus power through ownership of mining ASICs, that person may have much greater control over the system as a whole than would an ordinary dominant miner. Economic power representing control over capital earmarked for the system may also overlap with protocol/client power, since ordinarily he who controls the purse strings for funding the protocol and client also controls the protocol and client themselves. In systems with on-chain governance, economic power may also overlap substantially with both user power and (more directly than through funding mechanisms) protocol/client power.</p><p>Accordingly, in any legal test for determining decentralization, economic power should be assessed the most stringently of any of the forms of power over a blockchain system. Thus, while a relatively high concentration of consensus power may be tolerable in a system like Bitcoin while still asserting that Bitcoin is legally decentralized, a similarly high concentration of economic power should not be as tolerable.</p><p>5. User Power</p><p>User power refers to the ability of persons who do not have a significant amount of consensus power, protocol/client power or economic power to influence or resist those who do have a significant amount of such power. If user power is very strong, then even if the other forms of power are somewhat more concentrated than one might hope, the system may still be decentralized.</p><p>In systems without formal governance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, “user” can have a very broad meaning, and includes, for example, token investors, token holders, companies running dAPPs, hobbyist node operators, small-scale miners, non-core protocol/client developers, other developers or professionals who make their living advising about the system or businesses or governments that use the system as part of their infrastructure.User power primarily takes two forms: (1) moral/reputational rewards and punishments effected through social signalling; and (2) adversarial forking. There are other forms of user power— such as the power of token holders to sell tokens and thus adversely affect price or the power of dApp devs to migrate their users to another blockchain system — but there are also significant costs to such types user power, and, more importantly, not all types of users share those types of user power in common.</p><p>Even the relatively brief histories of Bitcoin and Ethereum provide some excellent examples of how powerful users can be. In Bitcoin, the threat of a user-activated hardfork, made credible through a joint exercise of user power and protocol/client power over Bitcoin, was instrumental in activating SegWit on terms different from those struck under the so-called “New York Agreement” by a small group of persons having substantial consensus power and economic power over Bitcoin. This has rightfully been touted as a watershed moment revealing the power of users (see here, here and here). The arguable success and persistence of various adversarial forks from Bitcoin (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, et. al.) is likewise a testament to user power in another form — since users who dissented from the triumph of “small-blockers” could fork away and start a system intended to cater more to the payments use case. On the Ethereum side, the persistence of the original Ethereum blockchain as “Ethereum Classic” after TheDAO hardfork shows that user protest to chain reorganizations decided by those with significant protocol/client power can be effective.</p><p>In systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, user power depends on the ability of a wide group of unaffiliated community participants to coordinate with one another. In general, it will require that the protocol/client is fully open source and that core devs do not have the ability to push updates to the client, so that adoption of client changes is voluntary and the threat of an adversarial fork is credible. Ideally, to make the threat of a fork effective, ownership of the brand and ticker symbol for the blockchain should be ‘up for grab’ by users, but other forms of decentralized brand ownership (such as the co-ownership arrangement by two independent organizations observed in ZCash) may also be effective. Other factors, like full nodes being easy to run, and a wide variety of unaffiliated, well-funded businesses being included in the user base, can be very helpful in bolstering decentralization through user power.</p><p>However, there are also constraints on user power in systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum — see above under “Protocol/Client Power” for a discussion of some of them. Arguably, Ethereum may have much less user power today than it did at the time of the ETC hardfork, because the dApps built on Ethereum are interdependent. Accordingly, in all but the most egregiously offensive exercises of protocol/client power, major dApp developers, who otherwise could operate as a source of independent user power, will tend to value staying on the same fork as one another more highly than asserting their individual political views.</p><p>In systems with formal on-chain governance, user power can assume additional forms, but they tend to belong to only to one category of user: the token holder. In delegated proof-of-stake systems, token holders have voting rights and the analysis of user power can become very complicated.</p><p>For example, if token holders can appoint block producers through their user power, consensus power is less centralized because it is constrained by token holders much more directly than Bitcoin users can constrain Bitcoin miners. However, if in such a system economic power is also very concentrated, then most users may actually have less power over consensus than they would in a system like Bitcoin, because a voting-minority is much more ineffectual in a system of formal governance than a vocal moral-minority can be in a system of multi-polar governance. If economic power happens to be concentrated in the hands of those holding substantial consensus power, the formalism of the system can lead to endless rent-seeking under the guise of formalist legitimacy. Similar pros and cons apply to on-chain governance of protocol/client development.</p><p>Although the analysis of user power is very complicated, in general it may be said that the broader and more diverse the base of “users” and the more power they have, the more likely a system is to be decentralized under the law.</p>A Flexible Test for Decentralization<p>A flexible test for decentralization would consider all the forms of blockchain power referred to above as factors, would assess each factor in light of the detailed facts and circumstances of a particular blockchain system, and would decide whether the system is sufficiently decentralized for legal purposes based on a kind of fuzzy logic about the extent to which each form of power is decentralized and how each form of power relates to the others in each specific case. This is, in effect, a form of lawyerly voodoo, but such tests — the Howey test being an example that is particularly notorious in the blockchain community — are common in the law, and can yield very good results and a degree of predictability as good judges consider cases and build up a body of precedent.</p><p>Here is my first stab at a flexible, rich legal test for determining whether a blockchain system is legally decentralized:</p><blockquote>General Statement of Test. An open network system is sufficiently decentralized if that system is an open network system and control over that system is widely distributed among independent persons.</blockquote><blockquote>Open Network System. An open network system is a peer-to-peer network of free open-source software clients which send, receive, validate and record data states on a distributed ledger in accordance with a protocol that is enforceable and verifiable by operation of the software clients.</blockquote><blockquote>Detailed Statement of Test. In general, sufficient decentralization will be found if, in light of all facts and circumstances, either:</blockquote><blockquote>(1) no single person or group of affiliated persons controls the open network system or the consensus, economics or software protocol/client of the open network system; or</blockquote><blockquote>(2) if any person or group does control one or more aspects of the open network system, control over other aspects of the system is widely distributed among independent persons in a manner that substantially limits the controlling person’s or group’s ability to interfere with or alter the open network system or other persons’ use and enjoyment of the open network system.</blockquote><blockquote>Rebuttable Presumptions to be Used in Applying the Test</blockquote><blockquote>(1) There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons owning or controlling more than 20% of the native tokens of an open network system, or who own or control token-sale proceeds the fair value of which exceeds 20% of the market capitalization of such token, has or have control over the economics of the open network system.</blockquote><blockquote>(2) There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons owning or controlling enough of the means of block production to violate the ‘honest majority’ assumption applicable to the open network system has or have control over the consensus of the open network system.</blockquote><blockquote>(3) There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons controlling a software client used by more than 50% of the nodes on the network has or have control over the protocol/client of the open network system</blockquote><p>This will typically be a difficult test to meet. And it should be a difficult test to meet. The purpose of finding that a blockchain system is sufficiently decentralized as a matter of law is to declare that since no person controls the system, no person is legally responsible for it and it is not subject to regulations, such as securities laws, that would ordinarily apply in similar circumstances. For this, the blockchain system must essentially be an un-owned, public commons. To qualify as such, it should truly exist for the benefit of and under the control of the public, rather than predominantly serving the interests of any specific person or group. Since power is subtle and omnipresent, a test of power must be rich, probing and comprehensive. One could analogize the difficulty of passing such a test to the difficulty of passing a “strict scrutiny” test under constitutional law.</p><p>However, the test is also very flexible and allows for balanced, fact-specific reasoning. Thus, under this test, a judge would be free to consider very nuanced check/balance dynamics such as those I raised in the previous section. For example, a judge would be free to declare that Bitcoin is legally decentralized even if there are facts in evidence showing that ASIC ownership is highly concentrated. After all, the judge could be persuaded that the power of any substantial ASIC owner would be checked by users through the threat of an adversarial fork or massive sale of BTC.</p>A Bright-Line “Safe Harbor” for Decentralization<p>Although a broad, conceptual test like the one set forth in the prior section will be the most flexible, accurate and complete method of determining whether a system is legally decentralized, I believe it would be insufficient by itself. Participants in blockchain systems should have more ex ante certainty about how the law applies to them than can be afforded by a complex, “fuzzy logic”, multi-factorial test. Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to propose a bright-line “safe harbor” identifying a subset of systems that are clearly decentralized based on simple facts (or so likely to be decentralized based on those facts that it is not worth regulators’ or judge’s time to undertake a closer inquiry).</p><p>Like other safe harbors (for example, the SEC’s “Regulation D”), reliance on such a safe harbor should be non-exclusive — i.e., anyone who wishes to adopt less conservative assumptions should still be free to prove decentralization through the broader, looser, conceptual test set forth in the prior section. It may also be necessary to define different safe harbors in different contexts — for example, a different safe harbor for considering decentralization under the Bank Secrecy Act than the Securities Act of 1933.</p><p>Here is a simplified version of the safe harbor I have proposed in the context of the securities laws. The full version of my proposal can be found here, and my open letter to the SEC explaining the rationale behind the proposal was published here.</p>♦Conclusion<p>I have done my best to efficiently set forth a reasonable starting point for legally testing when a blockchain system is sufficiently decentralized. However, it is only that — a starting point. A great deal more work is needed by a great many people to gain confidence in testing the existence and effects of decentralization for legal purposes.</p><p>Both the flexible test and the safe harbor set forth above in this article are available here. I have no illusions that I have developed a perfect test, and thus would highly encourage anyone interested in this issue — including but not limited to lawyers and coders — to ‘fork my legal code,’ as it were, and suggest alternatives and improvements. Only through such a collective effort will we will arrive at a satisfactory understanding of decentralized blockchain systems under the law.</p>ENDNOTES<p>I suggest reading these sources to better understand how decentralization affects the application of law to blockchain systems:</p><p>William Hinman: “Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic)”</p><p>Hester M.

  <p>propaganda in the age of Trump.</p>♦photo by Annie Spratt, via Unsplash<p>author’s note: this essay was originally written in March 2018 for a different, now-defunct platform — the text had been edited slightly from the original to reflect developments since then, and at the point of my moving all my writing to Medium in January 2019.</p><p>As of April 2020, I have further split this essay into two segments, Part I and Part II. This split was always a natural one and should probably have happened at the start, as a little over half the essay is theory, with the remainder application, but, as it was my first ever Medium post, I did not want to alienate readers, of whom I probably had none, by forcing them to read two pieces instead of one.</p><p>However, I believe I now have a large enough profile for this not to be a problem. The essay is in the form it should have been all along and ought to make for a better, more structured read.</p><p>Readers can also rest assured I have not edited the essay in any way since the republication in January 2019. In April 2020, I only restructured it, as described.</p><p>Enjoy.</p><p>*</p><p>**</p><p>*</p><p>continued from Part I …</p><p>Different Technologies, Different Memetic Systems, Different Outcomes</p><p>I have repeatedly claimed that technology in particular created the environment for centralized and strongly one-to-many memetics. We need to dig deeper into what the technology in question actually achieves and how it achieves it. Or, in our lingo, what the dynamics of different memetic systems are, and how these are affected or even created by different technologies.</p><p>The late nineteenth and early twentieth century saw a dramatic turning point in the history of memetics. Whilst systems of ideas certainly travelled by art, architecture, and religion, industrialised memetics had flourished ever since the printing press and had played a supporting role in every movement with any intellectual component since. But the late nineteenth century and early twentieth saw the emergence of three technologies that would centralize memetics after four hundred years of its relatively distributed evolution. Print media, radio, and television.</p><p>Unlike previous methods of memetics, these were strongly one-to-many, and were orders of magnitude more powerful than what came before. I have made the vague claim of ‘power’ throughout but am now in a position to define it: they sent a stronger and more encapsulating signal to more people, more often. The ideas propagated by television, for example, the strongest of the three, would reach a vast audience in a more arresting and sensually enveloping way than any competing system. This took the place of radio, which had been dominant for weaker versions of the same reasons and had taken the place of print media, which had been dominant for weaker versions of the same reasons still. The broadcast would also be completely coherent across millions of people who would all receive exactly the same message at the same time. It would more than likely reach the audience in isolation, and repeatedly; over and over again, every single day for a person’s entire life. This combination of factors meant that the message to be adhered to (being told what it is acceptable to think) would therefore generate exactly identical personal and interpersonal reinforcement far faster than any many-to-many system could possibly hope to overcome.</p><p>What happened over the past 150 years or so was the replacement of one centralized and strongly one-to-many memetic dynamic with another which was even stronger and even more centralized. But the next technological development to set its sights on media was the Internet. It has already proven far more powerful than these three ‘broadcast’ media, despite barely getting started. But crucially, its memetic dynamic is fundamentally different. It is strongly many-to-many, and has hence provided a way to overcome the personal and interpersonal resistance to competing propaganda that legacy media has simply never had to compete against before.</p><p>What I claim as the ‘power’ of the Internet has all sorts of instantiations: we can access the Internet whenever we want on smartphones, whereas TV and radio is scheduled. We can engage with others consuming the media simultaneously and at vast scale, be it on messaging services, comment boards, or sometimes as an intrinsic part of the medium itself, such as reactions on Facebook and retweets on Twitter. We can also engage directly with the creators and distributors of the media; launching a tweetstorm is a far more effective method of expressing your disgust than yelling at the TV. This is the essence of many-to-many: ideas are no longer only being broadcast, nor only commented on by other broadcast sources. Anybody can spread or critique any idea over a variety of media, can respond directly to disseminated ideas, and can form networks to distil and evolve ideas organically and without any central source.</p><p>Centralised propaganda has no hope of competing against this. It can’t instil personal resistance anywhere near fast enough to tackle what is constantly emerging from the network, and it can’t instil interpersonal resistance really at all, because it turns out people like having a platform to express their own ideas, and they don’t even need to use their real names. This Medium page is a perfect example. I like writing it. And in the previous place I posted this essay I pretended to be French. Go me. The success of the Internet is intertwined with the process by which memetics is being decentralized. We are returning to an era of distributed memetics.</p><p>What on earth does any of this mean? Readers with mental alarms for calling the ‘mainstream media’ sources of propaganda and not defenders of freedom and justice may have sensed this coming for a while now, but the clearest thing it has meant so far is the election of Donald Trump.</p><p>It’s not even the fact that Trump won the election that is interesting here; it is the technological mechanisms that allowed this to happen, and the role legacy media played. In short, legacy media had no clue what was happening and still mostly doesn’t. One might say that Trump pwned them and continues to pwn them day after day. To be clearer, Trump utilized the strongly many-to-many memetic dynamic of the Internet to brilliant effect, whereas Clinton relied on the twentieth century paradigm of one-to-many propaganda broadcast. The result, when understood properly, was frankly hilarious. Regardless of the merits of the candidates as candidates, Clinton’s campaign was probably the worst ever, and Trump’s the best (‘best’ as in ‘effective’, not ‘righteous’).</p><p>Why was Clinton’s campaign so ineffective and Trump’s so effective? That Clinton’s was ineffective is straightforward: it was built around broadcasting platitudinous propaganda, which wasn’t even good platitudinous propaganda. It had no central message other than: vote for me, I’m qualified or, occasionally, don’t vote for him, he’s crazy. With a powerful many-to-many memetic competitor around, this is almost certain to be a disaster because the audience no longer has insurmountable personal and interpersonal resistance. They can instantly go on the attack against terrible propaganda. To reinforce the point that this is not essentially linked to political outlook, consider that this is exactly what Pepsi discovered a while back with its Kendall Jenner debacle. In the television age, no matter the personal ambivalence or even anger towards this message, the lack of sufficiently powerful many-to-many memetic competitor to challenge it would have led to this ad being accepted — whatever it was embarrassingly trying to tap into beyond ‘please continue to buy Pespi, k thnx’. In the Internet era, many-to-many memetics rapidly outflanked and destroyed the source of the propaganda. It is bad enough when you don’t understand the memetic environment you inhabit, but when you have an opponent who does understand it, things can easily hilarious. This is basically what happened in the election: the Clinton campaign was Pepsi, and the Trump campaign was Black Lives Matter. Clearly, politics are almost completely irrelevant. What is relevant is the appreciation of the medium, and an embracing of its memetic dynamic.</p><p>Trump is the first ever social media candidate. It is easy to dismiss the ‘social media’ prefix as indicative of divisive tweets, fake news, and so-called data breaches, but it is difficult to understand the deeper cultural and technological shift that is really implied: the Trump campaign had an extraordinarily mobile and reactive feedback loop for the production of effective propaganda. The Clinton campaign was based around the assumption of the effective memetic dynamic of legacy media, meaning that its propaganda was centrally crafted and centrally distributed. And then that was it. That was the end of the process. Moreover, this took months to plan and execute. There were professionals, committees, budgets, and apathy. Trump mostly outsourced the production and distribution of propaganda to a kind of decentralized collective intelligence. He could A/B test material in real time, and could tap into and amplify whatever rose to the top of his enormous network of meme production. Hence Pepe the Frog, which started as nothing but a joke, ends up being retweeted by Trump himself, and fawned over by legacy media or, in other words, amplified. The frothing up of jokes on /r/politics about Clinton’s health following the pneumonia non-story made it into Trump’s prepared debate remarks.</p><p>That this strategy was working was in some sense perfectly measurable, and hence the election result predictable and not surprising at all. Consider this analysis of the Twitter exchange following the third debate. Readers are encouraged to explore for themselves, but the graphic I have pulled out below is a visualization of the strength of engagement between and amongst the most influential Twitter accounts following the final presidential debate. The bigger the name the greater the influence and the thicker the line the greater the engagement.</p>♦graphic from John Swain’s Medium post<p>What we see here is that all the biggest names are on the Clinton side, but that there are vastly more connections across a greater range of sizes and more engagement on the Trump side. This is exactly what you would expect in a contest between incumbent centralized and challenger distributed memetics. Propaganda emerges from broadcast by authorities: big names, few of them, broadcasting to vast amounts of small names with no engagement. Propaganda emerges from a network: names of all sizes except the very largest engage frenetically. However, if you only consider the legacy media’s coverage, it is totally unaware of this novel phenomenon — memetics existing outwith itself — and considers Clinton the overwhelming favourite.</p><p>The result? Well, as those data scientists rather presciently wrote: “There is a common perception that Hillary Clinton is winning the election comfortably. The assertion that there are a large number of bots ‘supporting’ Donald Trump plays to this perception by suggesting that the noisy support for Trump is not real. Based on what we observed in the Brexit election where there is a larger ‘hidden’ support for one side over the other, we would advise some caution over thinking the election is already won by Hillary Clinton.”</p><p>That the legacy media was dead set against Trump ended up playing perfectly to his hands, as did Clinton’s second line of attack: don’t vote for him, he’s crazy, precisely because neither really understood what was going on, whereas Trump did. A military metaphor is apposite: with their experience and resources, Clinton and the media would have dominated any traditional conflict, but they didn’t even begin to understand the enemy’s weapons and strategy in this conflict, given how technology had recently advanced. Dominating the legacy broadcast bandwidth could translate to something like immensely powerful artillery. But when the enemy invents Blitzkrieg, the Maginot Line is immediately useless. Two examples:</p><p>Firstly, the media endlessly reported on Trump’s tweets. The intention was to show him up to be an idiot, because many (probably most) of the tweets were and continue to be stupid. This was a deadly strategic error because the purpose of the tweets was not to put forward a political argument for critique, but to A/B test propaganda. All that is required to execute this strategy and enhance the potency of the feedback loop is exposure. Thank you very much, legacy media. Notice also the distinctly twentieth-century attitude on display here, evidently wedded to the memetic dynamic of legacy media: this approach would have made sense in 1980 had Trump penned a controversial op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. But it makes no sense at all on the Internet. Nobody seems to have told Clinton or the legacy media this, but nobody cares about the actual content of a tweet for more than 30 seconds. They are ephemeral, tongue-in-cheek, and decidedly unserious. The etiquette is to playfully rebut with a witty but equally unserious comeback. It is basically geographically remote hyper-scale bar room banter. If you go beyond 140 characters and to try to debate political science, you lose. Brevity is the soul of wit, not self-righteous fact-checking.</p><p>This also demonstrates pretty dramatically where the memetic power really lies at the intersection of the Internet and legacy media: legacy media, which has total top-down control over what it broadcasts in a strongly-one-to-many memetic dynamic, was manipulated into reporting on the memetics of the Internet.</p><p>Secondly, the ‘basket of deplorables’ comment. In any prior campaign, this would have simply been considered foolish, apologized for, and forgotten. Four years prior, Romney had a moment much like this which was embarrassing, but effectively a non-event in the long run. However, in the hands of the Trump campaign this was immediately turned into a meme — which still exists to this day. This could never happen in a centralized propaganda machine. I’m With Her took years to pull together. Deplorables took hours. And yet the average person probably would not understand the reference to I’m With Her today, whereas this discussion is arguably inextricably bound up with the very meaning of the word ‘deplorable’ in contemporary English. This is the difference in propagandistic capacity between the two systems, regardless of funding or institutional support. The phrase has its own Wikipedia page. Notice that the subsections listed are: Clinton’s Campaign, Trump’s Campaign, Trump’s Supporters. But no Clinton’s Supporters. Clinton’s supporters did not operate a many-to-many network of distributed memetics. Trump’s did.</p><p>I will mention an example which came in 2017, long after the election, but is perfectly indicative of the features of manipulating legacy media reporting and rapid and mobile decentralized feedback and reorganization. High off the hilarity of tricking the Clinton campaign into lecturing Americans about the dangers of racist frogs, there followed a period of time after the election during which roughly the same group pwned the legacy media so badly that it was manipulated into believing and that the OK sign and milk were secret symbols of a Nazi insurgency in the United States. The network did not do this to win an election or even to purposefully achieve anything at all; they did it because they thought it would be funny, and they were right. Just let that sink in: distributed memetics in the Internet age is now so much more powerful than any existing system of centralized memetics that it can co-opt the entire centralized apparatus just to get it to unwittingly broadcast jokes about itself.</p><p>A final indication of how all this related to the election, which is so visually vivid that it almost constitutes a meme in and of itself, is that Clinton would often appear with celebrities on stage, whereas Trump always appeared alone. In the era of strongly one-to-many legacy media, Clinton would have won this exchange. This is what I think she and the Democrats thought they were saying at the memetic level: All the cool and influential people like Clinton, so you should like Clinton too! But in this era, celebrities of this kind are redundant. They tell you what to think (i.e. they broadcast propaganda) and they do not engage. They are puppets of the centralized machine who may have exaggerated personal influence, but are puppets nonetheless. When they wander out of bounds they are quickly destroyed and replaced. Trump on the other hand engaged in a vigorous and frenetic fashion. On Twitter, at the rallies, and in interactions with legacy media. With that backdrop in mind, this is what Clinton’s choice actually said at the memetic level: Clinton needs unqualified celebrities in order to even fake engagement; Trump is the celebrity and he is engaging. Clinton lost this memetic battle because she didn’t even know she was in it.</p><p>Where Do We Go Now?</p><p>As with my insistence on political outlook being largely irrelevant to the past development of memetics, I think it will be largely irrelevant to its future development also; technology has no ideological affinity. The only sense in which political ideology is relevant, I think, was Clinton’s positioning within the Democratic Party, but I think that the personalities of the two candidates were far more important than the ideas they supposedly represented. The Democrats are far more closely aligned with the memetic dynamic of the twentieth century media complex; Republicans have some influence at the fringe, and also have their own conflicting outlets on outlying but stable cultural terrain, but on the whole I do not think this is a controversial proposition. Within the Democrats, Clinton could not have been more emblematic of ‘the establishment’, and so of course would rely on and be supported by the establishment mechanism of running a political campaign. Trump, on the other hand, is a maverick media personality who had no real ties to the mainstream political infrastructure and who, to some extent, certainly understood all of this to an almost infinitely greater degree than Clinton. This too, I do not think is controversial: Trump has one of the best intuitive grasps of the media of any political candidate in history, for better or worse, and Clinton has none at all. The arithmetic holds up.</p><p>But there is nothing essentially ideological here. It was a question of background and affinity to technique. Clinton could have embraced the strongly many-to-many memetic dynamic of the Internet and abandoned the dying strongly one-to-many legacy media complex. She just didn’t. I suspect Sanders probably would have done so to far greater (infinitely greater?) effect had he been the candidate. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez arguably did precisely this just two years later. But of course, in the Democratic primaries in 2016, the dying one-to-many legacy media complex had far greater sway than in the general election and Clinton relied on this to defeat Sanders, who was certainly a far better candidate. Maybe that rush of power gave her false hope for the general election. Who knows? The legacy media certainly does not know. They have absolutely no clue and moreover are still, two years later, spasming in outraged denial whenever they aren’t denouncing satirical Nazi symbolism or elucidating Facebook’s business model.</p><p>I noticed something very odd and, on reflection, alarming, following the election. I wonder if the reader did too; it became popular amongst a decent proportion of intelligent and well-educated people to signal their total incomprehension of events as a virtue. The more you couldn’t explain anything, the more righteous you must be, like a kind of piety to the prior memetic dynamic. I found this to be true particularly amongst pundits who never considered themselves part of the legacy media and took delight in dancing around the edges of allowed opinion so as to demonstrate their intellectual curiosity and originality. But they had still relied on the legacy media both to grant them a platform to access an audience, and to define the facts and the boundaries of acceptable interpretations of these facts in order to then have fun dancing around them.</p><p>This is all very, very strange. An important quality (perhaps the only important quality) of being educated and intelligent is to stress-test belief and seek out new knowledge. You only have real knowledge if you can both predict and explain things. If you cannot, especially if your existing toolkit has dramatically failed, then you need to pipe down and find better tools. And yet here were people holding up their broken tools to prove their inherent goodness. Of course I can’t explain this! I’m not a racist sexist homophobe!</p><p>I believe that what was really happening here is that a decent proportion of these tools had previously reliably come from legacy media, and since legacy media had abjectly failed in its fake role of reporting facts, these people were simply confused. The holding up of the tools was perhaps a demonstration less of righteousness and more of victimhood. Legacy media still did a fantastic job in its real role of broadcasting propaganda, but what happened in the election is that the distinction between the facts and the propaganda was so dramatic that, for the first time ever, the façade became simply untenable and the audience was left wondering what had been done to their default explanatory tools.</p><p>My favourite example from the public sphere was this Recode Decode interview. The whole episode is worth listening to, but at around 7 minutes, we hear Marc Andreessen, professional baller, silencing a shocked and horrified audience of inherently wonderful and righteous Californians, thinkers of the approved thoughts to a tee, by pointing out the obvious truth that the only media outlet that covered the election by reporting facts rather than broadcasting propaganda was Breitbart. Which is not to say that Breitbart is not propagandistic — of course it is — but it was the only major outlet whose propaganda corresponded reasonably well to the facts. If you read Breitbart you had an accurate idea of what was happening. If you read pretty much anything else, you did not.</p><p>There was and still is a great deal of chortling clustered around the Breitbart crowd over the false confidence the Democrats had entering the election and felt safe and free to broadcast. It is not hard to find YouTube montages of leftist pundits and politicians saying that Trump will never, in a bajillion years, be President, and compilations of major media outlets’ predictions on the day of the election: usually in the 90–95% range of a Clinton victory. But I think this faction misses the point too. They won a political victory, yes, but the victory was not fundamentally political. It was a better riding of a monumental technological and cultural wave of change. Next time they might lose. If Cruz had run against Sanders, they probably would have, and they have in fact since lost the House due to Democratic mobilisation with a far more decentralised approach than usual.</p><p>The shade of politics that is relevant is, again, not sourced in ideology, but in cultural dynamics. The Democratic Party has the potential to suffer more from this shift because it is more closely aligned with the dying regime. It faces a kind of political innovator’s dilemma; the change required will be painful and costly in the short term, but is necessary in the long term and will become more painful the longer it is put off. One might think of Wal-Mart only taking ecommerce and Amazon seriously after it was too late to do anything about it. Bizarrely, at the same time, there are a variety of less institutionalized movements, which are clearly largely ideologically aligned with the Democratic Party and which seem to understand all of this almost perfectly. I have already praised Black Lives Matter on exactly this account. It’s a strange situation; it’s as if Amazon had been borne among the junior ranks of Wal-Mart executives.</p><p>But what the Democrats, their followers, and their memetic apparatus need to do right away is stop blaming absolutely everything on racism or fake news, or at least stop expecting that these complaints will be taken seriously. Strongly many-to-many memetics means that they no longer have to be taken seriously. There is greatly minimised interpersonal resistance to laughing at these claims. But the dilemma still exists because it is hard to let go of techniques that have worked for so long, especially if there is some truth to the claims. Of course racism exists and is more prevalent amongst those who voted for Trump than those who did not, and of course the Russians bought a vast array of targeted Facebook ads in an attempt to influence the election. But this is like trying to interpret the fall of Communism solely through the lens of dialectical materialism. But capitalism exploits the working class! Great. That something is true does not mean that it is relevant. Angrily repeating surface level truisms is futile when the problem at hand lies in the broken foundations of the entire explanatory system.</p><p>The explanatory system for politics of centralized memetics is broken. The break is irreversible because it is powered by, and is an inevitable consequence of, the Internet. Memetics is becoming distributed and the equally exciting and terrifying potential of the Internet is in wondering what other centralized organizations can become distributed next; terrifying if you are part of the dying centralized power structure, exciting if you are part of the distributed network replacing it. If distributed memetics in its infancy can outwit the entire centralized legacy media complex and win the Presidency, what can it achieve as it grows? Is there a system to check its power? Ought there to be? Can there be? And what other power structures can be targeted?</p><p>I don’t really know, and at this point I don’t believe that anybody really knows. But we are all about to find out. Buckle up.</p><p>With thanks and credit also to Situational Assessment 2017, by Jordan Greenhall, and Collective Intelligence and Swarms in the Red Insurgency, by Gustavo Montes De Oca.

  By Genesis Node on The Capital<p>Ever wanted to know why the media and ‘economists’ get it so wrong about Bitcoin? Here’s the Genesis Node point of view on some of the most fundamental topics that regularly appear about Bitcoin in the mainstream media, which are typically biased or poorly presented.</p>♦Photo by Elijah O&#39;Donnell on UnsplashBitcoin is private and can be used by criminals and terrorists<p>This is a favourite of the media and hostile regulators. The fact is that Bitcoin operates using the most transparent, verifiable, and traceable accounting ledger that has ever existed. It is true that identity verification is not always required to create a wallet and send or receive transactions so in this regard there is a level of masking that is provided, however, blockchain forensics is a new and emerging capability that could help to track and trace any funds being used for illegal purposes. Danish police made the news in 2017 when they traced criminals through their Bitcoin transaction activity. It is worth remembering that the current banking system is still the most effective means of laundering money in the world with an estimate of $3 Trillion being laundered through the US system annually, so it seems somewhat hypocritical for lawmakers, media and financial services firms to lay the ‘Bitcoin is used by criminals and terrorists’ argument at the door when the current system is guilty of much worse.</p>♦Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash<p>There are other cryptocurrencies such as ZCash, Monero, and the newly developed MimbleWimble protocol that underpins Grin and Beam, which use privacy features to obscure the sender and the recipient. There is certainly a theoretical case to be made that these protocols would be more effective at money laundering, however again, transaction volume analysis suggests that any illegal activity funding taking place over these networks is incredibly small if at all present compared to the volumes being transacted through USD.</p><p>At a more philosophical level, here we can also return to whether censoring money is an attractive trait. Ultimately, in a free society, an individual ought to have the ability to transfer value for whatever means and ends they desire and any attempt to monitor, trace or prohibit this can be viewed as censorship…any society where a nation state tries to impose censorship and de-platforming upon its citizens is a society where the citizens desperately need the means to transfer value as required, unencumbered.</p>Bitcoin mining wastes energy♦Photo by American Public Power Association on Unsplash<p>This is a particularly sensitive topic and one which the recent trend of climate change activists are sure to latch onto. The truth is that yes, Bitcoin energy consumption is huge, roughly the same as the annual consumption of energy in Ireland or the Czech Republic. The equally huge counter to this that is an uncomfortable truth is that a large percentage of this energy consumption uses green/clean or renewable energy, estimated between 30–70% clean. The range is so high as data is very difficult to verify and as such, allows biased narratives to be deployed by the media.</p><p>Further to the country comparisons, it has been reported that the US military alone is the 58th largest consumer of energy in the world — where is the media outcry against this energy consumption?</p><p>Whilst that seems a lot, let’s consider some other data points:</p><ul><li>The USA Christmas lights consume more energy annually than some developing countries at around 6.63 billion kilowatt-hours whilst countries like El Salvador uses 5.35 billion kilowatt-hours per year</li><li>The streaming of X-Rated videos from the internet globally is believed to consume as much energy as countries such as Belgium, Bangladesh, and Nigeria contributing c4% of greenhouse gas emissions globally and could rise to 8% of global emissions by 2025</li></ul><p>The above are simple examples but the oft used phrase is “we could use that energy for something else.” The challenge here becomes a question of libertarian ideology as there is no royal “we” to centralise and co-ordinate energy consumption globally, ultimately if a user pays for the energy they consume and the market is willing to produce and supply it then what that energy is used for is entirely up to the discretion of the consumer.</p><p>The incentives of the Bitcoin network align so well that they promote efficient deployment of capital and operational resources by Bitcoin miners. In other words, Bitcoin miners locate their operations in parts of the world that offer the most cost-effective access to energy and to this date there is no market whereby energy consumers pay more/less for the end, usage of their electricity and until a market develops, which ensures that Bitcoin miners need to pay a higher rate for electricity then they will continue to consume at the market rate. Typically, this is either through use of green or renewable energy sources, which explains why Iceland, with its abundance of geothermal energy, is a key global Bitcoin mining centre.</p><p>It is often the case that unused electricity is deployed for use by Bitcoin mining entities, by ‘unused’ we refer to electricity that is generated by a power station, typically through hydroelectric power but an excess capacity is created over and above the required demand so the electricity is lost as it transmits throughout the network, eventually going unused. In this instance, mining companies set up their operations in remote locations in countries such as China and strike deals for excess energy directly with the energy provider themselves. So whilst a popular argument is — “but the human race could use that energy to much better effects” in many cases, much of it is already going to waste, and it cannot be transmitted for use over vast distances anyway. In a somewhat philosophical view, one could counter-argue that such ‘lost’ electricity is actually turned into a commodity money (Bitcoin) and sent globally over the internet making its utility, production, and shipping costs infinitely superior to other global commodities.</p><p>In an example of well-aligned incentives a Canadian mining company ‘Upstream Data’ recently developed a product that allows oil drillers to attach a Bitcoin mining rig to their methane gas flares in oil and gas fields to convert the excess energy burned off to power a mining rig and re-use some of the energy by-products of drilling that would have otherwise been lost — incentive alignment works.</p><blockquote>As Saifedean Ammous, author of the Bitcoin Standard writes in his research blog:</blockquote><blockquote>“Everything in our lives is related to energy. Transportation, manufacturing, cooking etc. requires energy. Thus, efficient energy production is essential to our everyday lives. Bitcoin incentivizes efficient energy production and therefore sets the correct incentives for the energy system as a whole.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Bitcoin is a serious alternative to the current financial system. Bitcoin has the features to be a qualified, stateless, world currency since it is censorship-resistant, permissionless, and trustless and since it provides instant settlement. The network is open and censorship-resistant through proof of work. Essentially, Bitcoin is a common good from the people for the people.</blockquote><blockquote>The correct incentivization inherent in the Bitcoin protocol and the importance of Bitcoin as an alternative to the financial system justify the massive use of energy for mining.”</blockquote>Bitcoin can’t be used to buy coffee (micro-purchases)♦Photo by Clay Banks on Unsplash<p>Anyone using this argument is focussing on the wrong metrics and not comparing like for like and even worse, being dragged into the somewhat fanatical and disingenuous world of the white paper title outlining that Bitcoin was intended to be ‘peer to peer electronic cash.’ Over time, Bitcoin has developed and grown to becoming more akin to a form of digital gold, and to an extent, is a ‘heavy’ digital asset to use as it takes longer than others to confirm transactions on the network. So whilst this comment is partly true as it could take an hour or more to confirm the transaction, it is wrong to compare Bitcoin transaction speed and scalability to that of the Visa, PayPal or Venmo networks.</p><p>Essentially Bitcoin is a network for final settlement — it probably is not important to use the Bitcoin network to record your coffee transaction on the most immutable and transparent ledger…for ever.</p><blockquote>As Bitcoin and blockchain researcher and thought leader Nic Carter states, Bitcoin is best thought of as a large container ship transporting expensive goods over long distances rather than the local postman delivering letters and parcels over the final mile.</blockquote><p>When humans began to deploy fiat or paper money for use in an economy in place of a specie backed currency such as the gold standard, this can be referred to as a ‘Layer 2’ technology. Use of precious metals in direct exchange is layer 1, the addition of a 1:1 backed paper is the second layer making portability much easier. Layer 2 or 3 solutions on top of Bitcoin such as the Lightning network, may well deliver the scalability in Bitcoin that many are asking for so it can be used for micro-purchases. Even a bi-metallic standard equivalent digital asset protocol that is less energy intensive than Bitcoin and serves as a ‘Silver’ or a ‘Copper’ to Bitcoin’s gold could develop.</p><p>Ultimately there is a cost to write transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, in future, this may rise, and as such, these transactions may be pooled and netted off on a less frequent basis in a similar way that central banks settle balance of payments deficits today.</p><p>In summary, comparing Bitcoin to Visa, PayPal and Venmo is the wrong comparison to make at this point, but over time, Bitcoin may well have additional layers of technology to solve the scalability challenge, and this may also extend to the inclusion of some form of privacy.</p>Bitcoin isn’t backed by anything / has no intrinsic value♦Photo by Jacek Dylag on Unsplash<p>Since 1971 and the complete separation from the gold exchange standard, the US dollar has not had anything backing it. Fiat currency is an established medium of exchange, however, in some countries, it does not serve its purpose well as a store of value or a unit of account due to hyperinflationary challenges. However, if we set these to one side, the notion that fiat currency is backed by anything is a severely misguided notion. It is true that governments mandate the use of fiat currency and as such, they ‘back the use by Law.’ This does not give fiat currency any real value, however, and if the government and central bank mismanage the economy, they undermine the value of the currency and cause inflationary challenges as we saw in countries such as Argentina, Zimbabwe and many others throughout the 20th century.</p><p>Money is a collective belief system and anyone who wants to argue that fiat currency is ‘backed by fundamentals’ is essentially saying, they don’t really understand how money works, they trust central banks and governments because they haven’t researched or analysed any other potential system, their belief systems, frameworks, and mental models allow them to shortcut thinking and analysis of this nature by buying into the notion that ‘the gold standard failed’ and that we now live in a modern banking world. These arguments will ignore the failures of old that are creeping back into the system today and may very well lead to a Roman Empire style collapse of the global economy. We know for certain what the monetary policy and scarcity of the Bitcoin network will be for the next 120 years — we have no idea what any central bank or government may do to monetary and fiscal policy from one week to the next.</p><p>If anything, Bitcoin is ‘backed’ by the laws of mathematics and code and unlocking these laws costs time, resource (both human and capital), and energy. Whether Bitcoin has any value is determined by the market forces, and the Austrian economics school theories of Mises and Menger with their notions of subjective value theory and the regression theorem of money — ultimately we view Bitcoin as a Veblen good, and it has only ever served the purpose of value transfer.</p>Bitcoin could be hacked♦Photo by Clint Patterson on Unsplash<p>Hacking Bitcoin is next to impossible. It has been in existence for 10 years, and any kind of threat or attack that exists that could disrupt it has already been attempted. It is reported that eccentric millionaires have even paid teams of hackers $1m over the course of a year to hack the network, and they have not been able to yield any success.</p><p>When we discuss hacking Bitcoin, there are two obvious options:</p><ol><li>To hack the software itself</li><li>To undertake a 51% attack</li></ol><p>Hacking the software itself is next to impossible as a result of the verification and mining consensus rules any attempt to alter the software will be rejected by each miner running an up to date version of the software and similarly any attempt to process a fraudulent transaction will be detected by each node and rejected.</p><p>People often wonder what makes the Bitcoin blockchain secure, and it is often said that a key risk to Bitcoin is the fact that it is software and software could just be hacked, if not now, then in the future with a quantum computer. The reality is that the Bitcoin blockchain is secure as a result of the multiple different failsafe mechanisms that guard against attack, the energy, and computing power used to continue the longest chain of transaction records and the game theoretical nature of the outcome of such an attack.</p><p>To unpick this further, Bitcoin uses complex and advanced cryptographic techniques to guard against a 51% attack. That is the idea that if enough miners grouped together 51% of the total mining resources, then they could unpick the blocks one by one and change the history on the digital ledger to move transactions to other accounts that they hold the private keys for. Such an attack is virtually impossible as the size, cost, and complexity of the attack would require a large number of nation states to work together — a level of cooperation which has never happened in history aside for coalition forces during world war 1 and 2.</p><p>To firstly gain access to the necessary computing power and energy required to undo the confirmed transactions would be no mean feat and would effectively result in a split or a fork of the chain as the history and record would now be different from the original. The actors would then need to undertake the attack all the while being watched and monitored by the other 49% who would continue confirming blocks on the original chain. This means that for the attack on the original chain to be successful, the attackers would also need to amend all the new blocks confirmed every 10 minutes since the attack began — otherwise, the attacked chain of the network would have no value. So the attacker would then need to continue spending money on computing power and energy to catch up to the rest of the 49%, which would be a long drawn out process and would likely bankrupt the malicious attacker. It is estimated that a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network would cost an attacker almost $600,000 per hour.</p><p>So, in summary, the incentive to launch a 51% attack and change the ledger is just not present. Similarly, any actor attempting to exploit the code or vulnerabilities in the network will have their attack rejected as each node runs a copy of the Bitcoin client and as such, any attempt to make a change to the code will be rejected by the network as all the other nodes will be running a copy of a different software.</p><p>Another popular example the media likes to use is that Quantum computing would break the Bitcoin private key encryption — this is akin to saying that you don’t need to worry about ageing because someone will invent time travel before you die. Quantum computing is at least 30 years away and the current claims regarding quantum computing are overstated. That said, the entire Bitcoin development community are already considering how to respond to quantum computing threats and how to embed quantum resistant cryptography into the core software so by the time a legitimate quantum threat exists it is highly likely that a legitimate quantum resistant defense will emerge and the entire Bitcoin code, network, and mining equipment will shift to adopting quantum resistant technologies.</p>Bitcoin is too volatile to be a store of value♦Photo by Claire Satera on Unsplash<p>We are only 10 years into its lifecycle, so speculation and large holders could manipulate price movements, however, it is important to remember the concept of how commodity money goes through various stages of development. Bitcoin has successfully transitioned from being a collectible to the early stages of a store of value. Once more liquidity comes into the Bitcoin network, then it will be harder for large holders to manipulate the price. At some point, these holders will sell and take their profits to spend on whatever they please. Those coins will then be available on the market for new entrants, and in turn, these individuals may well hold for a long time to watch their value increase and more liquidity comes into the system, again, at a certain point, these people will sell their holdings. The pattern will continue, and there will be severe price appreciations and declines, however, these will become less severe as liquidity increases — once this happens, the store of value stage will be complete, and Bitcoin can then progress to becoming a Medium of Exchange and a Unit of Account.</p><p>So at present, volatility attracting new market entrants all the time, however over the long term, the rollercoaster needs to settle into a more traditional, long term market cycle for institutional investors to feel comfortable allocating a significant portion of their assets into it.</p><p>For others around the world though, Bitcoin already operates as a store of value in countries where governments and money have failed. Countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Turkey have all seen appreciations in Bitcoin purchases, and despite price declines from c$20k to $3k, this has been a better place to store wealth than the local currency.</p>Bitcoin is not regulated and governments will just kill it♦Photo by Sebastian Pichler on Unsplash<p>Regulation doesn’t solve problems entirely. There is no government in the world that can actually regulate the Bitcoin network. Governments can take action around the edges of the network, but even officials within the US Government finally recognise that they cannot stop the Bitcoin network or Bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Governments are, however, able to regulate the edges of the network such as the fiat on/off ramps which are typically subject to ‘know your customer’ regulations and ID checks. Governments are also able to regulate activities such as Bitcoin ownership and Bitcoin mining if they wish. Some governments have banned Bitcoin mining as an activity, and others have gone as far as to outline that only the state is allowed to provide Bitcoin mining facilities.</p><p>What is clear is that as a protocol, Bitcoin cannot be shut down. Governments do not have the ability to stop it or come anywhere close to killing it. What regulators are looking at and in particular, US regulators is the introduction of investment-friendly vehicles. These will serve as fiat on/off ramps and will allow institutions access to Bitcoin. A key concern is the notion of custody, who will hold the private keys to access the funds on the Bitcoin network? There are proposals in place at present, and it won’t be long before a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) exists so in some form or another, a regulatory framework will emerge for Bitcoin and the entire cryptoasset industry.</p>Bitcoin has no CEO♦Photo by Hunters Race on Unsplash<p>That is exactly the point. The decentralised nature means the network is upgraded by consensus and any miner that disagrees with the update can choose to ‘fork’ and continue a separate chain. Not having a CEO means there is no single person or entity that can choose the direction and design of the protocol without vigorous debate with the whole community first. A CEO can be called in to testify in government hearings or pursued for mismanagement of funds — without a CEO the Bitcoin network becomes an entity that is not subject to the normal laws of power, control, coercion, intimidation, manipulation, and corruption — this is one of its greatest assets.</p>Bitcoin is the first and first doesn’t always mean success<p>Bitcoin is the 5th iteration since 1990s of a digital money, and it is the first to fully succeed in generating a system that removes centralised 3rd parties and creates digital scarcity. Bitcoin draws upon other previous protocols such as eGold and Hashcash and implements it in a fully decentralised way.</p>Bitcoin is opensource so it could just be copied/forked and improved<p>The game theory involved in creating a fork of the Bitcoin code is such that any fork is unlikely to take a significant amount of value, network, or mining power away from the core BTC code. In 2017 a disagreement about transaction scaling ensued where one group wanted to maintain a low block size at around 1 Mb per block, and another group wanted to increase the block size which would, in turn, increase the throughput and speed of transactions. In principle, the idea seemed logical however an entire debate and discourse erupted around the broader risks and challenges that ‘big blocks’ present. One key issue is that the mining ecosystem would no longer be possible for single and small entities, rather it would start to require a more industrial size and scale — this would put control of mining operations more in the favour of large, server farms and corporations who could afford the CAPEX set up and open running costs of such a huge operation. To maintain decentralisation the original chain was maintained whilst a splinter group forked the Bitcoin blockchain and continued transactions using bigger blocks. This was called the Bitcoin Cash or BCash chain. Not long after, further divisions occurred within the BCash community and this chain then split into BCash ABC and BCash Satoshi’s Vision. Needless to say, all of these actions have been almost catastrophic for these chains as they now have next to no value being transferred over them and the mining rewards and incentives are not there as the value of the coins on these chains is very low — the low hashpower as a result also opens up these chains to a 51% attack. The hourly cost to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin is estimated at $600,000, the equivalent for BCash is $7,500 per hour.</p><p>It is by studying the outcomes of chain forks that the beauty of the Bitcoin network, game theoretical reward mechanisms and the in built self-reinforcing incentive mechanisms that one can really appreciate the brilliance of the system.</p>Conclusion<p>If you have managed to stay focussed and read through to this section then you deserve a medal! But more importantly, you should now be able to see how and why the media gets the coverage so wrong. The cornerstone of so many articles is put in the wrong place and often intentionally so to present a biased view of ‘why Bitcoin is a failed experiment’ without informing readers or viewers that there is a different viewpoint. For many, Bitcoin is just too complex to understand and they are happy to accept the word of elected officials at the Treasury or Government regarding what money is and how they should interact with it. Typically, economists find it hard to reconcile that commodity money and Austrian economic principles may actually be a better option than the fiat, state-controlled, centrally managed monetary system that is in place globally which they are likely to have studied for 10+ years and committed a significant portion of their time and energy into contributing to. For these people, the truth that Bitcoin is the most effective form of money the world has ever seen is too painful to accept and as an American writer, Upton Sinclair once said,</p><blockquote>“it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it.”</blockquote><p>About us: Genesis Node is an executive training organisation focussing on helping businesses and individuals to understand Bitcoin, digital assets, blockchain, smart contract technology, how they fit into the world and how they might disrupt existing operating models.

  <p>TL:DR; ATO treats forks as creating a “new asset” causing unexpected tax burdens for any Australian taxpayer holding cryptocurrencies in future.</p>♦Background<p>I got a nasty surprise when preparing my 2017/2018 tax return. I had sold my Bitcoin Cash as fast as possible, and gotten around to selling other minor forks just before the close of the financial year. The ATO then decided that those sales were (1) assets under 12 months old, and (2) a cost-basis of 0. The result was that they wanted 48% of the amount in tax; over twice what I was expecting and had set aside!</p><p>In Australia, you (generally) pay Capital Gains Tax on the difference between the purchase (“base price”) and sale prices, but you only pay half of the amount if you held it for 12 months or more.</p>The ATO’s Reasoning<p>The ATO reasoned that a fork creates a new asset valued at zero and the new asset is the one whose rules have changed. I can see how they arrived at this, and am kicking myself for not getting involved earlier: having a real technical expert involved might have avoided the shallow understanding which lead to this.</p>A Split is Not a New Asset<p>The idea that a new asset is created is the base misunderstanding, and to see why, we need to go beyond simplifying nomenclature like “wallets holding bitcoins” and “tokens” and understand what’s actually happening.</p><p>Bitcoin is a network of independent nodes, each maintaining its own ledger attaching amounts to keys which can spend them. When I say “I own 1 bitcoin!” what I mean is that all up-to-date nodes on the network have a current entry in their ledger which indicates that 1 bitcoin can be spent using a secret key that I hold. Normally the bitcoin protocol ensure that over time, nodes will come to consensus the contents of their ledgers. This controlling an entry in this consensus of ledgers is what bitcoin actually is, and all bitcoin is: this is what people mean when they say “bitcoin is unbacked”.</p><blockquote>Consensus that I control an entry in the ledgers is the asset, because that’s what bitcoin actually is.</blockquote><p>Bitcoin has value because people respect these ledger entries as currency, and as long as the network is functioning normally I can use it to send an instruction to update the ledgers which will spread through the network and eventually be entered in all the ledgers (in particular, the one trusted by the “recipient”).</p><p>What did change with the Bitcoin Cash fork was nor normal though: One (larger) part wanted to update the ledger rules to allow a new appendix with each entry, the other wanted to update the ledger rules to simply expand the allowable number of entries. The network split into two irreconcilable parts which no longer talk.</p><p>My key didn’t change, or even gain any additional capabilities. The consensus of ledger entries I controlled split into two groups, but an asset split is not a taxable event. If I own gold and split it into different isotopes, that is not a taxable event, does not change its cost basis, and does not change its acquisition date.</p><p>Over time, the market decided that ledger entries of the smaller group (now called Bitcoin Cash) were worth less than those of the larger group (now simply called Bitcoin).</p><blockquote>When the ledgers split into two groups, the asset (lines in the ledgers) split. This is not a taxable event.</blockquote>The ATO’s Workaround I: Asset Valuation<p>Once they decided to treat it as a newly acquired asset, the ATO instantly had a new problem: how to value the new asset? If you gain an asset, you have to pay income tax on it! Yet clearly the user did nothing, and hitting them with a random tax bill seems unfair (especially if they couldn’t spend it before the price dropped precipitously). To work around this, they chose a value of 0.</p><p>The first taxation officer I spoke with declared that they chose a value of 0 as it was the most favorable to the taxpayer, the second insisted that the value of 0 was a “matter of fact”.</p><p>You could actually trade Bitcoin Cash before the fork (though you had to send your Bitcoin to an exchange to do so), and there were various other future markets available. I agree that the market was far too easily manipulated and shallow for this price to be a reliable signal, but it’s clearly not zero. Picking 0 is unlikely to draw immediate ire from taxpayers (though see below!), but it’s very hard to defend: as a tax payer I certainly can’t decide to value “hard to assess” assets at 0!</p>The ATO’s Workaround II: The Technical Test<p>When deciding which was the new asset, the ATO chose a technical test: the one one whose rules hadn’t changed was the original asset, and the one which had was a New Asset. This often gives the same results as you’d expect if you assumed a “market” test (i.e. biggest market-cap fork is the original, or the one with the original name is the original).</p><p>However, it reflects a lack of understanding of how cryptocurrencies work. For all the talk of “immutable ledger”, they change the rules with some regularity. I can think of five bitcoin rule changes, but there were more and we anticipate another one this year (2020).</p><p>In particular, while Bitcoin Cash was forked by changing a consensus rule (making it a New Asset according to the ATO), this was a mere technicality: two weeks later Bitcoin also changed, as they locked in the Segregated Witness soft fork. As this change was opposed by Bitcoin Cash proponents, it was necessary they fork first[1]. It could be argued that at the time Segregated Witness activated, the Bitcoin Cash protocol was more similar to the original rules than Bitcoin itself was!</p>Absurdities That Follow<p>If you assert 1+1 = 3, things tend to break down badly. The results here are the same: by asserting that a new asset is created, you create a bunch of new problems:</p><ol><li>If you held Ethereum across the Ethereum Classic Fork, Your Cost Basis is 0.<br>Ethereum became a New Asset on July 20th 2016. This was confirmed verbally by the current chair of cryptocurrencies at the ATO. This means that if you sold Ethereum since then you probably didn’t pay enough tax, and if you sold it before July 20th 2017, you’re not entitled to a capital gains discount. Surprise!</li><li>Bitcoin may have become a New Asset at the first halving.<br>Greg Maxwell once told me that a number of miners tried to continue to grant themselves 50BTC rewards after the first halving. Their fork quickly petered out, but it’s easy to argue that their fork was following the original rules, and thus Bitcoin is a New Asset. If true, and you held it across November 2012, your cost basis is now 0, and no capital gains discount is available if you sold before November 2013.</li><li>Bitcoin may become a New Asset on any Soft Fork.<br>Since any rule change can create a fork, you may find yourself holding a New Asset, with cost basis 0 and no CGT discount until 12 months after the fork (unless, of course, it forks again!), should some fool decide to do so. It’s unclear whether you need to be aware of the fork, or how serious it needs to be, but it would be an interesting business model to offer the ATO a contract to create such a fork to create a taxation windfall!</li><li>Bitcoin will become a New Asset on any Hard Fork.<br>Experience has shown that any Bitcoin hard fork will be controversial; if the original chain is continued (as expected), Bitcoin becomes a New Asset with cost base 0.</li></ol><p>In these last cases, you have no control over whether this happens, creating massive taxation risk.</p>What I’m Doing About It<p>Clearly, if we want people to actually hold or use cryptocurrencies in Australia, these rules are impractical. Given they’re wrong on a fundamental level, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on a Private Ruling and objections. At the end of 2019 I engaged a law firm for further research; their professional advice was that it was going to be expensive, and difficult.</p><p>Reluctantly, I have folded on this. It seems the only hope for reasonable outcomes in future in Australia would be legislative change.</p><p>[1] Technically, they had to change to implement replay protection, otherwise in theory they could have waited for the soft fork and then mine an invalid segwit tx to fork off afterwards. That would have been an impractical method, however.</p>♦

  ♦Illustration by In Bitcoin We TrustYou have to educate yourself properly to get the most out of Bitcoin.<p>The economic crisis currently affecting the world was long awaited. It highlights the flaws of a monetary and financial system that is widening the disparities between rich and poor.</p><p>The decisions taken by the Fed in recent days clearly point in that direction. The Fed is going to print more than $8T in defiance of all American citizens, who will be hit hard by what will be a real currency devaluation.</p><p>Bitcoin was created following the previous crisis in 2008 to offer citizens around the world an alternative.</p><blockquote>Bitcoin is our best alternative for opting out of a system that no longer works after 49 years of experimentation.</blockquote><p>Don’t be fooled, the current system is nothing more than an experiment like all the other economic systems of the past.</p><p>Current events clearly show that it no longer works.</p><p>Sooner or later a better system will emerge. That system is Bitcoin in my opinion. A system with a monetary policy that truly respects its users. A system that gives you the opportunity to live on your own terms so that you choose to save rather than spend.</p><p>That’s what Bitcoin is all about: giving you the right to choose a better life in the future.</p><p>Bitcoin’s inflation works for you while the US dollar’s inflation works against you. You need to understand this fundamental notion to protect your future.</p><p>A future that can be better with Bitcoin. Better for you, but also better for others.</p><p>This is another benefit of Bitcoin that allows you to get richer, while helping others to do the same. Bitcoin protects both your individual interests, but also the collective interests.</p><blockquote>While the richest 1% benefit from the fiat system by demanding more and more money from the Fed and the U.S. authorities, we citizens have only Bitcoin to protect us.</blockquote><p>If you want to understand the importance of Bitcoin for the future, you need to inform yourself properly.</p><p>With the wrong inputs, your outputs are bound to be wrong as well. In order to make the best possible decisions for your future, you will need to educate yourself as best you can.

  <p>By Ross Ulbricht</p><p>On December 10, 2019, I wrote the following (see here):</p><blockquote>“A drop below the beginning of wave 2 (around $4,200) would invalidate the impulsive count of wave (5) because wave 4 cannot overlap wave 2 ...This would indicate a much greater likelihood that our second scenario is playing out.”</blockquote><p>Since then, the price of bitcoins has dropped down to ~$4,000, fulfilling the above requirement. With the bullish count invalidated, the picture is becoming clearer. The cycle-degree bull market — from Bitcoin’s beginning to the ~$20,000 peak of late 2017 — is over. We are now in the last wave (wave ⓒ) of Bitcoin’s first cycle-degree bear market (the largest yet). Figure 1 shows the five primary-degree waves up (①, ②, ③, ④, ⑤) in wave I along with the three primary-degree waves down (Ⓐ, Ⓑ, Ⓒ) in wave II, with the end of wave II estimated.</p>♦Fig. 1<p>Estimating the extent and duration of wave II is difficult and imprecise. There is no limit to how low it can go (except $0) because wave I started at $0. And there is no hard limit to how long it could take. However, corrections will often end in the price range of the previous fourth wave of one less degree. That was wave ④ from back in 2014. Its price range was $175–$1,240. The two previous bear markets (of primary degree) reduced prices by 86% and 94%. An equivalent reduction by wave II would take prices to $2,800 or $1,200. Wave Ⓐ of II reduced prices by 84%. An equivalent reduction by wave Ⓒ of II would take prices to $2,200.</p><p>In terms of duration, if wave Ⓒ lasts as long as wave Ⓐ, it will end around June or July 2020. However, waves (c) of ② and (c) of ④ (not labeled in Figure 1) were considerably larger than their respective (a) waves. If wave Ⓒ of II conforms to this pattern , it could drag on into 2021.</p>♦Fig. 2<p>Figure 2 shows a closer view of wave II to date. Wave Ⓐ brought prices down to $3,200, and wave Ⓑ brought them back up to nearly $14,000. Wave Ⓒ should bring them to new lows below $3,200, completing wave II. I have tentatively labeled the move from the end of wave Ⓑ to the low near $7,000 as wave (A) and the counter-trend rise above $10,000 as wave (B). The low near $6,400 is not the end of wave (A), but is rather wave (b) of (B) in a pattern called a “running flat.” So now, we are in the final wave (c) of Ⓒ of II. A break below the major low of $3,200 will be a solid confirmation of this, at which point we will be trying to determine when the final low is in. This will be a major buying opportunity. If the price rises above the peak near $14,000, we will have to reevaluate our interpretation, but at this point that seems like a very unlikely scenario.</p><p>As noted before, the end of wave II will be accompanied by extreme pessimism and possibly antagonism toward Bitcoin on par with the extreme optimism that accompanied the end of wave I. It will take fortitude to buy in such an environment, but the rewards as wave III takes prices to new highs will be well worth it.</p>♦

  <p> Some years ago, anthropologist and Wall St Occupant David Graeber wrote a history of Debt in which he debunks the “myth” of barter. In his telling, barter never exists in human history – Any transfer of property is the result of an exploitative power relationship, therefore ownership is theft, debt is slavery, and socialism is the answer.</p>
<p>In short, Graeber was questioning Adam Smith’s thesis that the division of labor leads to the voluntary exchange of surplus goods, which leads to the emergence of money. Chartalism vs Metallism.</p>
<p>George Selgin debunks Graeber’s “debunking” by pointing out that barter is an unstable system, and any population that engages in barter will quickly progress to monetary exchange or perish from unmatched needs. Anthropologists rarely encounter barter societies in the wild because it’s a temporary state.</p>
<p>Here we are in the time of coronavirus, where preppers and hoarders have emptied store shelves and I’m forced to violate social distancing to trade toilet paper for distilled water from a neighbor. Barter is back. Will TP become the new store of value, or shall we starve?</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>In California, anti-gouging laws prevent retailers from raising the price of goods to meet heightened demand. Six months ago, Clorox disinfecting wipes averaged $3 a can. Today, it’s illegal to charge more than $3.30 even though I would gladly pay twice that. </p>
<p>This isn’t barter; it’s demonetization. Dollars no longer serve as an accurate unit of account for Clorox wipes, especially since no amount of dollars can buy wipes that are out of stock. This is the point where essential items should gain intermediate commodity status and evolve into money.</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>Except that can’t happen. The FBI has a Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force that prevents enterprising citizens from providing much-needed liquidity on scarce products. It&#8217;s illegal to even source them from elsewhere. My mother tried to buy a box of Chinese KN95 respirator masks for my brother’s hospital, but the masks were seized by customs at the border. </p>
<p>Even in the brief historical periods where barter may have existed, it was never really barter so much as bilateral monopoly. Do you think tribal chiefs allowed members to freely negotiate with hostile tribes? Of course not – some of the earliest traded goods were women and children. </p>
<p>So Graeber was wrong. Power isn’t the ability to assert ownership over property. Power is the ability to control how others assert ownership over property.</p>

  ♦Photo by Brandon Wong on UnsplashDon’t take your rights for granted. If you care, defend them.<p>Governments the world over have long sought to cripple the assurances of consumer encryption. They back it up with strong, emotional reasoning. They pull on the heart-strings by illustrating how encryption tools allow global pedophile rings to organize their operations and distribute their content. A disgusting thought. Or they imbue the populace with fear, illustrating how a terrorist cell might use this technology to organize an attack, safe from the prying eyes of the brave men and women tasked with “protecting our freedoms”.</p><p>Leveraging a world thoroughly distracted and frightened by the Coronavirus, the US Federal Government is now using the shock doctrine to try their hand once more at undermining this technology. Called the EARN IT Act, a fittingly dystopian doublespeak, the proposed law relies on a sleight of hand to form a law-enforcement run committee responsible for regulating online platforms, ultimately granting it the authority to unilaterally undermine encryption (while not explicitly saying this). The legislation had been circulating for a while with apparently little chance of passing. That is, until the pandemic opened the legislative buffet. Now it’s looking like it might just pass after all.</p><p>So, what’s the big deal?</p>The Long Game<p>Government has a history of attempting to undermine encryption tools harnessed by everyday people. Clearly visible attempts reached a crescendo with the Crypto Wars of the early 1990s, before they were forced underground into the controversial operations of today’s NSA. But they’ve never lost sight of the prize: a window into the activities and thoughts of everyone in the world.</p><p>In 1991, Phil Zimmermann invented an encryption program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). We will explore a little more how this works later, but briefly it allowed for two things: end-to-end encryption, meaning individuals could obscure messages to each other such that the intended recipient was the only person able to read it; and digital signatures, meaning the author of a message could certify that they themselves created it. Governments, particularly the US, had been keeping close control of encryption programs because of their military usefulness: if they met certain criteria they were legally defined as munitions. Zimmermann had written quite the program, the first major consumer challenge of these controls, and soon he was the target of a criminal investigation for “munitions export without a license”.</p><p>Zimmermann was never formally charged, but his creative defense set the groundwork for a vital legal precedent for our online lives. He published the PGP source code as a book, meaning that global distribution was protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (the one about free speech, for those unfamiliar):</p><blockquote>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</blockquote><p>Tying the use of encryption programs to the US Constitution, ensured that it was upheld as a basic legal right. While Zimmermann never had to defend formal charges himself, his defense was integral to two later legal cases that established the legal precedent.</p><p>Since then, the US government has continued to take pot-shots at encryption, but largely focused its energy on the clandestine activities of the Deep State. Attempts to change the status quo have been largely unsuccessful, with the Fifth Amendment (the right not to self-incriminate) used to set the precedent that a suspect can’t even be forced to reveal a password. But privacy advocates shouldn’t be taking victory laps: the CIA was recently revealed to have owned a major distributor of government encryption software, Crypto AG, which it had used to spy on foreign governments for decades, by inserting vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the NSA has illegally conducted widespread mass surveillance of the American population, after leveraging new capabilities granted to it under the Patriot Act. For exposing these crimes, Edward Snowden is forced to hide in Russia. On the bright side, he also revealed that these agencies still have no way to break PGP.</p>The Principled Objection<p>It was around the time of the Crypto Wars that the cypherpunks came to prominence. Timothy C May was early, writing The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto in 1988. He predicted nothing short of a revolution arising from the technologies he could see being developed. He foresaw that a technology like PGP was just around the corner, and that this would herald the rise of a sovereign online individual. An individual able to act entirely anonymously, in a world where reputation was tied to verifiable pseudonymity rather than government identity. He foresaw that the state would try in vain to stop such progress, but championed a principle that needs no argument among free people: liberty.</p><blockquote>“Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures.” — Timothy C May, The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto</blockquote><p>More directly concerned with privacy, Eric Hughes wrote A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto in 1993. He made the case that “privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age,” defending that privacy is something humans have always been able to rely on finding. Before the electronic age, “people have been defending their own privacy for centuries with whispers, darkness, envelopes, closed doors, secret handshakes, and couriers.” But with the dawn of communications technologies gaining traction as he wrote, it was foreseeable that without defending the assurances encryption offered, this important element of a society was in danger.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hal Finney, who would go on to receive the first ever Bitcoin transaction 15 years later, identified in Politics vs Technology that there was a tendency among the cypherpunks to prematurely celebrate victory and avoid the political. He astutely drew attention to the fact that cypherpunks harnessing such simple tools as text and communication protocols, could end up in jail if participants didn’t engage the political sphere. And indeed, this is what we see now in the high profile cases of Julian Assange and Ross Ulbricht.</p><blockquote>“The notion that we can just fade into cypherspace and ignore the unpleasant political realities is unrealistic … Have people forgotten the PGP export investigation? Phil Zimmermann hasn’t. He and others may be facing the prospect of ten years in prison if they were found guilty of illegal export. If anyone has any suggestions for how to escape from jail into cyberspace I’d like to hear about them.” — Hal Finney, Politics vs Technology</blockquote><p>It is with Hal Finney in mind that we push back, both in principle and in regulation, against encroachments on these hard-fought liberties.</p><blockquote>“Fundamentally, I believe we will have the kind of society that most people want. If we want freedom and privacy, we must persuade others that these are worth having. There are no shortcuts. Withdrawing into technology is like pulling the blankets over your head. It feels good for a while, until reality catches up.” — Hal Finney, Politics vs Technology</blockquote>You’ve got something to hide<p>People have been trained to see privacy as malicious. But as Eric Hughes put so simply in A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto, “privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.” If one tries to make the argument for privacy to someone who isn’t particularly concerned by it, the common response is to observe that they “have nothing to hide”. While this speaks volumes of the comforts and security people have been offered in life, it betrays a lack of concern for the multitude of scenarios where someone might have something to hide. What’s legal is not necessarily what’s moral; indeed, laws are often changed by the activities of people doing that which they are not supposed to be doing.</p><p>Take same-sex relationships, for example. There is an increasingly clear consensus in most Western societies that these relationships should not be oppressed by the state (even while there is disagreement on whether they are culturally acceptable). While recent legal victories to this end have been celebrated as examples of the system allowing for real freedoms, it’s often forgotten that these victories would not have come to pass if people did not have the ability to privately break the law. What’s also forgotten is that these relationships and religious freedoms remain forbidden in large swathes of the world. A successful attack on encryption would move societies closer to that hypothetical world where every single law is 100% perpetually enforceable. Would-be offenders would know they have a guaranteed jail term for crossing the line, so in the present example, same-sex relationships would rarely happen in the first place. This is the Big Brother argument: the very act of mass surveillance changes behavior and suppresses the human will. Some might like this idea, but many would see a tragedy in it: how would these relationships come to be legal if so few had ever experienced one? It would be astonishingly naive to suppose that no other such cases are out there, still pending the official stamp of approval.</p><p>“I have nothing to hide” is also an attitude that betrays an assumption of guilt: the opposite of a legal tradition that presumes innocence until proven otherwise. The EARN IT Bill is playing a clever positioning game in its name, leveraging this assumption. It implies that the government gives people their rights, and they must therefore earn the right to privacy, but this is the wrong way around. If one charitably assesses the purported goals of democracy, it is the process by which a citizenry chooses which liberties they might forgo for the collective. Government does not have the power to grant people the right to privacy. They already have it. Rather, people have the power to surrender that right.</p>Privacy and secrecy are not practically separable<p>People half-sold on the argument for privacy technology, often attempt to delineate between privacy and secrecy. Their argument is that you have a right to privacy in the sense that you can close the door to the bathroom when you’re using it. But you don’t have the right to secrecy — if you’re suspected of doing something nefarious behind that closed door, they argue that bursting in would be in service of a “greater good”, and that the ability for our enforcers to do so is a critical capability.</p><p>The people making this argument appear to intuitively understand the importance of privacy technology, but have been so deeply compromised by the narrative that they can’t see the flaw in such an attempt at bifurcating between privacy and their definition of secrecy. For the two cannot be practically separated. In the connected world, either all the information you’re sending is able to be snooped, or none of it is. This is a fundamental, practical limitation. But once a secure communication is complete, nothing is stopping an individual from divulging a secret from that communication. The answer to this conundrum isn’t spying, it’s old fashioned police work.</p><p>The “greater good” argument can also be turned on its head, particularly when it comes to the state. One of the strongest cases for encryption is accessible human resilience in the face of tyranny. As most people sit at home, locked up with their liberties suspended for the “greater good” in the face of the Coronavirus, it should be increasingly clear how easily tyranny can be leveraged against people in the modern age, despite the assurances they’ve told themselves about how democracy fixes this. This is true even if one charitably grants that the current response is justified. Today, the average person’s fragility is strikingly clear. Their capacity to conduct activities in secret if needed ought to be obvious, not just in principle, but in the increasingly likely case that they need it.</p>The Fallout<p>Putting aside the philosophical reasons that one might care to protect encryption, it’s arguably the practical implications that make a stronger, more immediate argument. A successful attack on encryption undermines the fundamentals of many tools and practices we have come to rely on.</p>A sly, roundabout attack on encryption<p>The EARN IT Bill requires that all online platforms comply with a list of as-yet undefined “best practices”, that will be created by a commission of 19 people controlled by US Attorney General William Barr and law enforcement agencies. These committee members will have the power to unilaterally define and enforce criteria that online platforms must meet in order to retain legal protections from criminal and civil liability for user-generated content under Section 230 (47 U.S.C. § 230). Typically Orwellian, they’ve even managed to word it such that encryption might be theoretically nullified without mentioning the word:</p><blockquote>“This bill says nothing about encryption. Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” — EARN IT Bill co-sponsor Sen. Blumenthal</blockquote><p>So, you ask, if the criteria are yet to be drafted, and the Bill makes no mention of encryption, what’s the cause for concern here?</p><p>To those paying attention, this is transparently the latest in a slew of attacks on encryption that have ramped up dramatically in the past year. The primary indicator is to observe who, exactly, is expected to be involved in this commission:</p><ul><li>In December, Senator Lindsey Graham (co-sponsor of the current bill) threatened tech companies that “you’re going to find a way to do this or we’re going to do it for you,” with regards to routine surveillance.</li><li>US Attorney General William Barr, who will ultimately be running the commission with the ability to approve or veto anything, has attacked encryption so consistently during his term that it’s increasingly become his MO.</li><li>And the VP at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) was strikingly transparent in a hearing of the Bill, saying that he wants every message sent on the Internet to be read by government-approved scanning software, with findings reported to law enforcement. By implication, the companies operating as the pipes and platforms for the Internet in effect wouldn’t be able to securely encrypt anything.</li></ul><p>As the EFF points out:</p><blockquote>“You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys. The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is just another way to break end-to-end encryption. Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others.”</blockquote>A primer on encryption<p>To understand why attacks on encryption are so damaging, it’s important to have a base level of awareness about how encryption works. To dramatically oversimplify, encryption is the process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.</p><p>Early encryption followed a method known as symmetric key cryptography, meaning both the sender and receiver required the same knowledge to obscure and reveal a message. For example, a symmetric encryption algorithm might require iterating each character by one place in the alphabet. ABC would be encrypted by moving to the right and becoming BCD. The recipient could decrypt it by reversing the same algorithm: moving each character by one spot to the left and arriving back at ABC. Think of it like a sender and receiver sharing a post box to which they both have an identical key. The sender opens the box with his key to deposit a message, and the recipient uses their identical key to retrieve the message from that same box in order to read it.</p>♦Source<p>Recently, encryption has been employed asymmetrically, known as public-key cryptography. Rather than having a single point of failure as in symmetric key cryptography (where both sender and receiver have the same key), everyone has their own unique private key from which they can derive a public key. We needn’t go into the technical here, so to simplify, this public key can be seen as an address that can be published publicly. A sender can encrypt a message to the recipient’s public key, and only the recipient can ever read it by using their private key. To use the post box example again, it’s like everyone having their own box which only they can open, but they can share the address with correspondents. PGP, discussed earlier, was an early example of this being used at a consumer level, and it is still rather successful.</p>♦SourceYou use encryption every day without knowing it<p>At a pragmatic level, attacks on encryption threaten the most basic technologies you’ve come to rely on, for both the meat-space and internet economy. These should be increasingly obvious if you consider the needs of all the individuals around the world working from home under quarantine.</p><p>End-to-end encrypted messaging and voice calls allow for distributed teams to securely discuss sensitive topics. It ensures that important documents can be verified as coming from who you think they’re coming from, and that those containing sensitive material — such as claims on your health plan — haven’t been exposed to malicious actors. That little padlock icon you see in the address bar of your browser is telling you that your connection to the server hosting this blog post is secure. It verifies that the information rendered on this web page has been sent from the server you think it was sent from, without a malicious actor injecting code or other content in the middle, or snooping on your credit card details.</p><p>Beautyon has even pointed out that an attack on encryption would be game theoretically stupid for America in today’s connected world:</p><blockquote>“The men advising Trump can demand that encryption has back doors in America, but they cannot demand that anyone anywhere else follows her. This would mean that only US web sites and services are vulnerable; the entire US internet would be globally recognized as an unsafe zone for e-commerce. It would be a disaster for the tech sector of the US.”</blockquote><p>The central, practical problem with attacking encryption is that it introduces a fundamental weakness in this infrastructure. What these actors want is something known as a backdoor: an intentional exploit, known to law enforcement, that can be selectively used in the course of an investigation. Leaving aside the unearned trust that law enforcement will not abuse such access, the most obvious problem is that other bad actors will find these exploits. Even without the intentional addition of weaknesses, the pace and magnitude of these exploits is already growing at a concerning rate: just look at how malicious actors are able to gain access to Amazon’s Ring cameras, or how almost half of America had their social security numbers exposed by Equifax.</p><p>While the arguments above should all be considered of utmost importance, here’s the real kicker: even with a backdoor, law enforcement won’t be able to achieve their goals. These laws are futile for their purported aim. Encryption standards are open source and broadly distributed. If you need to use it, you’ll be able to. The end result is mass surveillance of average citizens in exchange for trivial improvements to the efficacy of law enforcement. The EARN IT Bill, enforceable at the platform level rather than targeting encryption programs themselves, only violates those who don’t think they have “anything to hide” and thus don’t bother to find alternatives. If the government forces a backdoor into iMessage, for example, those that wanted to would still be able to send encrypted messages with a little more effort. They would simply encrypt messages on their computer before copying it over to the communication application. The recipient would also have to take a little more effort to decrypt the message, but the result would be the same. Those snooping on iMessage would just see what appears to be a long string of random characters. If a group is sophisticated enough to run a global pedophile ring, they’re going to do this. But if you’re telling your friend that you’re going for a cheeky second run in violation of your quarantine quota, you might not bother to encrypt it and soon get a knock on the door.</p>Rise up<p>Security researchers often argue that the government shouldn’t be in the average person’s threat model. The argument is that you’re probably not important enough for them, but if you are, then they will always get you anyway — so what’s the point. They point to Julian Assange, a heroic activist against tyranny, detained and tortured in London. Aaron Swartz, who wanted people to have access to the research they had funded, driven to death by DoJ bullying at the behest of academic publisher JSTOR. This case is particularly jarring amidst the Coronavirus crisis, as JSTOR has been seeking brownie points by temporarily allowing open access to a limited subset of its database. Ross Ulbricht, set up with egregious false accusations, dropped before trial, to sway the jury’s perception. These are the sorts of online actors who know many of the best practices for covering their tracks, but they are hunted relentlessly by the full scope and fury of the state.</p><p>Yet these same people also demonstrate the exact activities that should be a rallying cry for why encryption is so important. Maybe stories of child abuse can pull at your heartstrings (and obviously one shouldn’t diminish these stories: it’s the purest evil), but the same tools in the hands of a principled, independent journalist can be harnessed to expose the child abuse rampant among the world’s most powerful people themselves, as with Jeffrey Epstein’s network. Maybe the specter of terrorism is a strong argument for you as to why such powerful tools shouldn’t be in the hands of the layperson. But without encryption, Julian Assange’s Wikileaks might never have been able to pull off the clandestine operations required to expose the Obama administration’s role in arming ISIS. If terrorism is such a threat, it might be beneficial to understand exactly who’s involved.</p><p>This argument — not to bother evading the government — is defeatist, but it is also incorrect. These attempted abuses of our liberties, and the government’s role in feeding the problems they profess to solve, demonstrates that the government should be the centerpiece of everyone’s threat model. The cynical nature of the EARN IT Bill demonstrates that they are one of the greatest threats to human life and liberty.</p><p>The second- and third-order effects of a successful attack on encryption are poorly understood and dramatic. Honest citizens will lose their liberties while the worst people will continue to find workarounds. There’s a counter-intuitive rationale to expect that the fight against child abuse can actually be more effective by strengthening encryption, not undermining it, as it serves to protect investigative journalists and encourages whistle-blowers with stronger assurances of anonymity.</p><p>It’s an intellectually lazy mental shortcut to think that attacking encryption would magically improve things. If anything, it will make things worse.</p><p>Encryption is antifragile. Encroachments by malicious actors will only strengthen the need for it, and the assurances that its developers seek to offer. It also forces knowledgeable users to broaden the scope of their threat model. Using free and open source software like PGP and Signal, the everyday person can build a web of trust including people who can verify the software they’re using and certify who they’re communicating with. Begin to do the hard work. Fight for your right to privacy.</p><p>Sincere thanks to Alex, Thib, hodlonaut, Max Hillebrand, Matt Odell and Hass McCook for their help with this piece.</p><p>If you want to learn about responsible Bitcoin custody for your fund, exchange, or other vehicles, have strict LP and risk management requirements, or otherwise appreciate a trust-minimized profile, we’d love to talk.</p><p>Please email us at custody@kn0x.io</p><p>Knox</p>♦<p>Privacy isn’t free was originally published in Knox Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>VP Mike Pence, asked by CNN&#39;s Wolf Blitzer if the the U.S. was slow in reacting to the coronavirus outbreak: &quot;The reality is we could have been better off if China had been more forthcoming.&quot;</p>
<p>&mdash; Peter Nicholas (@PeterAtlantic) April 1, 2020</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>China lied about their numbers. </p>
<p>Ohhh, I am so mad. The local stores have been out of toilet paper for four weeks. I asked why they didn’t restock in greater quantities; the stockers said their shipments had been calibrated to China’s Numbers. Health care workers don’t have protective gear – turns out our Strategic National Stockpile was downsized according to China’s Numbers. Hospitals, facing immediate bankruptcy, are forced to reduce physician pay and furlough staffers – a key component of their annual budget hinges on, what else, China’s Numbers. </p>
<p>Turns out China’s Numbers are a lot like LIBOR, a reference rate that serves as a keystone for the entire economy. The US Surgeon General, CDC, World Health Organization, are still advising us not to wear masks. Mask effectiveness models undoubtedly based on China’s Numbers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The medical community made &#8212; interpreted the Chinese data as: This was serious, but smaller than anyone expected. &#8211;Dr. Deborah Birx, Deep State Department</p></blockquote>
<p>This is stupid, but remember Russia? They spent a few rubles buying Facebook ads in 2016, and set off a butterfly effect that hacked our election, undermined democracy, and placed a Putin puppet in the Oval Office. </p>
<p>Initially, no one believed the DNC’s excuse that Russia had thrown the election. Even Mark Zuckerberg said the idea was crazy. But a constant drumbeat of establishment figures chanting nonstop about Russian hackers and Russian disinformation campaigns, and anyone who disagreed was accused of being a Russian shill. It turns out if you bleat nonsense for long enough, people&#8230; well, people still aren’t dumb enough to believe it, but they’ll accept it. They’ll pretend to see the Emperor’s clothes to avoid being canceled.</p>
<p>So even Trump had to play along, acknowledge the Russia narrative.</p>
♦Billboards at the Moscow airport
<p>Anyone could appreciate the value of having a general-purpose scapegoat. Vermont’s power grid went down – blame Russia! Yahoo suffered a major data breach – definitely Russian hackers. Experian loses everyone’s social security number – Russia again!</p>
<p>If China didn’t exist, we’d blame Iran for lying about their numbers. Or Russian disinformation campaigns. </p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>The real victims in all of this are not the COVID-19 patients who will die, but the journalists hoodwinked by public health officials. Excuses are now acceptable substitutes for results. After multiple generations of rewarding failure, we’ve come to believe that everything will be fine as long as we can blame someone for our oppression.</p>
<p>And maybe this works in the West. Maybe if the virus had originated in Germany, we could cry foul and demand another century’s worth of reparations. But it didn’t, and we can’t. Strange, that the Marxist countries that celebrated class struggle refuse to recognize our victimhood.</p>

  <p>There currently is a glaringly huge incentive problem in blockchains. It is worth experimenting with new chains and technology, but in order to do so, each chain needs its own token. And whenever a token is involved, human greed inevitably takes over and even the most well-intentioned projects turn into marketing-driven price pumps. What I propose here instead, is a viable way to allow for new experimental chains to be linked to Bitcoin in such a way that speculation is largely taken out of the equation. The one caveat? It won’t be able to act as a store of value like Bitcoin.</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>t.co/EnjKbtXK38</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@SomsenRuben</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>Back in 2014, one area of exploration was the decentralized two-way pegged sidechain. If it were possible to trustlessly move coins from one chain to another, then Bitcoin’s 21 million coin limit could be used as a base upon which all experimentation takes place. This was once thought to be possible through the use of SPV proofs, but was quickly abandoned due to being insecure.¹ Perhaps in the future zero-knowledge proofs can reliably provide this functionality, but as of today, the closest thing we have are Drivechains (a somewhat controversial idea which relies heavily on miner incentives and UASF) or trusted federations (e.g. Liquid or Statechains).</p><p>This brings us to the one-way peg — burning bitcoins in order to receive tokens on another chain. Burning one bitcoin would be equal to receiving one token (preserving the 21M limit), and moving back would be impossible. Projects have done this in the past (e.g. Counterparty), but they only allowed burning for a limited period of time, after which speculation would still run rampant. What I propose here instead, is a perpetual one-way peg (P1WP), meaning users can move to other chains at any time they want.²</p>♦As Sam once said: “There’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo… and it’s worth burning your bitcoins for.”<p>From a value perspective, the main thing to notice is that this makes BTC the superior speculative asset, since you always have the option to convert it. Anyone who thinks that one of these new P1WP sidechains might be better than Bitcoin, should therefore logically still prefer to hold BTC. This means speculating on the new asset is near-pointless³, and Bitcoin’s network effect is retained as new technology gets developed on top of these sidechains.</p><p>If a new sidechain does well, more and more people will want to burn their coins.⁴ If it doesn’t do well and dies off, it only affects those who were brave (or foolish) enough to use the sidechain. They will have burned their BTC for what is now effectively a worthless token. The key here is that in either scenario, Bitcoin holders are strictly positively affected, since their coins increase in value when others burn theirs.</p><p>But why would anyone be willing to burn their bitcoins? There can be only one reason: there is an immediate need to use that token to pay for transaction fees. The token essentially reflects the current demand for block space on the sidechain. You can think of Bitcoin as an orchard and the token as apples. You only buy apples when you are hungry (for block space), not because you think someone else will pay more for them next week. Apples are a bad store of value. If you want to invest in the future of apples, you invest in the orchard (Bitcoin).</p>♦No, that man with the cool sunglasses is not Bitcoin Core developer Sjors Provoost (I think)<p>The inability of moving back to the Bitcoin blockchain (other than trading with someone) essentially means the sidechain tokens will never be an appealing store of value, but every other use case becomes possible without needing to introduce yet another highly speculative token. Think colored coins with privacy features (enabling federated BTC two-way pegs), experimental smart contracts, DAOs, DeFi, or any of your other favorite buzzwords.</p><blockquote>Ironically, the P1WP actually realizes a famously misleading marketing claim Ethereum made at launch: it’s just “gas” and not competing with Bitcoin as a store of value.⁵</blockquote><p>While the P1WP can function on a sidechain with its own independent consensus algorithm, it makes a lot of sense to utilize Blind Merged Mining (BMM), since that’s another mechanism that synergistically ties it to Bitcoin.⁶ BMM essentially outsources the act of mining to the Bitcoin miners without requiring them to validate the BMM blocks. Anyone can create a BMM block and have miners include it in a block by paying them a regular Bitcoin fee. Since this transfers all the fees in the BMM block to miners, this increases the PoW security of the Bitcoin network.⁷ My fully functional design for bringing BMM to Bitcoin can be found here.</p><p>So there you have it. If your chain is not trying to be a store of value, you have no more excuse. You don’t need to issue a new speculative asset — all you need is the perpetual one-way peg.</p><p>Thoughts? Comments? Join the discussion on Twitter or Reddit.</p>♦Is he looking determined or about to cry from having sand in his mouth? I can never tell.<p>¹ The general issue was that 51% of all miners could create a fake SPV proof and take all the coins, which would be particularly problematic if the sidechain has low security and stores many coins.</p><p>² Adam Back entertained the idea back in 2013. Note that a perpetual peg means that the parent chain needs to be continually validated in order to witness when new coins are created through the burning process. SPV proofs are also an option, but less secure.</p><p>³ If too many bitcoins are burned or demand drops, it’s possible for the token to become worth less than one bitcoin. Consequently, if demand picks back up, the token will go back to being worth one bitcoin. This is an event that can still be speculated on.</p><p>⁴ While extremely unlikely, it’s even possible that the new sidechain is so popular that everyone moves over, making this essentially an opt-in hard fork.</p><p>⁵ First finish reading this article, then see the picture below these footnotes.</p><p>⁶ There is a theoretical problem where the Bitcoin blockchain gets reorganized after a burn, causing unbacked token inflation. BMM makes this impossible, because a Bitcoin reorg would also mean the BMM chain gets reorganized.</p><p>⁷ This may prove to be crucial in light of the subsidy decreasing and the block space market needing to compensate and generate a higher fee income for miners.</p>♦The Ethereum foundation had the right idea, despite their “speculatory oopsie-daisy” in terms of execution.♦

  <p>By Ross Ulbricht</p>♦<p>Every time a block is added to the Bitcoin blockchain, the miner who discovered it is rewarded with new bitcoins according to a schedule set up when Bitcoin was first launched. The reward started at 50 bitcoins per block and is cut in half every four years, eventually reaching zero. The next halving is set to occur in May 2020, reducing the reward to 6.25 bitcoins. This has led to speculation about how this event might affect the value of bitcoins.</p><p>The reasoning goes that, if the rate (or flow) of new bitcoins being added to the current total stock of bitcoins is reduced, then the value of all bitcoins should increase. This so-called “stock-to-flow ratio” is a measure of how hard a currency is (how hard it is to debase through inflation). The harder a currency is, the better it functions as a store of value, which is one of the essential properties of money.</p><p>This sounds reasonable, so we should be able to look at how the value of bitcoins changed after the last two halvings and see the effect. The block reward halved from 50 to 25 bitcoins on November 28, 2012 and again from 25 to 12.5 on July 9, 2016. In both instances, the value of bitcoins as measured in U.S. dollars (the biggest market for bitcoins at those times) increased dramatically, by more than ten-fold.</p><p>It sounds like an open and shut case. We have an hypothesis — that an increase in the stock-to-flow ratio will lead to an increase in value — that has proven correct in both instances that it occurred. Now all we need to do is load up on bitcoins before May 2020 and watch the profit roll in. Before you do, let me point something out.</p><p>The block reward schedule has been known publicly since Bitcoin’s inception. It is not a secret, so we are not the only ones who know there will be a halving in May 2020, nor are we the only ones who know what happened to the value after the last two halvings. Everyone knows. Therefore, to profit from this knowledge, you must buy in before everyone else who is hoping to profit from it.</p><p>“No problem,” you might say. “I’ll just buy in a few days before the halving and beat everyone to it.”</p><p>That’s great except there is nothing stopping everyone else from doing the exact same thing! It is a race to be first all the way back to the present day. The name for this is “discounting,” and the idea is that all publicly available information about an asset is already factored into its current price.</p><p>“OK,” you say. “Then why did the value rise after the first two halvings? Everyone knew about those too, so the halvings should not have had any effect.”</p><p>Did they have an effect? Those halvings occurred during a truly spectacular bull market in which bitcoins rose in value 75% of the time (see here). With those odds, it is more likely than not that both halvings would occur during an uptrend just by chance. In other words, we can’t say that the stock-to-flow hypothesis was validated, so we can’t use it to predict what will happen this next time around. However, that does not mean the value won’t rise, or that it will fall. It just means that if it does, it probably is not due to the halvings.</p><p>What we can say about the upcoming halving is that it can be used by bulls to justify being bullish, just as bears can use the discounting hypothesis to ignore it and justify being bearish. Why the bulls are bullish and the bears bearish in the first place is another question entirely and one I address here.</p>♦

  <p>The madness of this world became obvious in an instant. Everything is
changing way faster than most of us ever imagined — but I’m not
worried. To the contrary, I’m weirdly optimistic — because of Bitcoin,
and because of you.</p>

<p>You probably don’t know me; I probably don’t know you. And that’s
perfectly fine. However, I know some of you — and I believe that I
know some of you quite well, even if we have never met or met only
briefly. I have read your writings, watched you debate each other, saw
the things you’ve built, and listened to your voices for countless
hours. I don’t care if you identify as a bitcoiner, or as a maximalist,
or as a pre-/shit-/multi-/whatever-coiner. I don’t care if you fell down
the rabbit hole years ago or if you just got the first glimpse of the
honey badger den. I don’t care about your political beliefs, sexual
orientation, gender, religion, age, and countless other qualifiers that
might be used to put you in a box. The fact that you are here, reading
this, thinking about Bitcoin, caring about Bitcoin, is enough for me.
That’s why I’m bullish. Bullish on Bitcoin, and bullish on bitcoiners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bullish on bitcoiners.”</p>

  <p><cite>Matt Odell</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin’s implications are so far-reaching, the innovation so profound,
it boggles the mind. The inter-disciplinary nature of this beast
attracts minds from countless areas of expertise: computer science,
cryptography, mathematics, physics, economics, finance, trading,
engineering, the list goes on and on. Bright minds, extraordinary
characters, strong opinions, contrarians, idealists trying to change the
world — all those and more make up the loose collective we might call
bitcoiners.</p>

Honey Badger Don’t Care

<p>Don’t get me wrong: Bitcoin doesn’t need you; it doesn’t need any of us.
It’s incentive systems have a way to make sure that Bitcoin will be
fine, even if the set of people working on it and using it changes
completely. It will be fine, just as it is now as the whole world grinds
to a halt.</p>

<p>The current crisis — and the financial repercussions that will
inevitably follow — will make it obvious that we need Bitcoin more
than Bitcoin needs us. Again, don’t get me wrong: we must not be
complacent. We must continue to care, continue to build, continue to
educate, continue to proselytize, continue to argue, continue to debate.
We find ourselves at the forefront of a battle of ideas, and in this
battle, complacency kills.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ask not what bitcoin can do for you, but what you can do for
 bitcoin.”</p>

  <p><cite>Adam Back</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can contribute by coding, writing, educating, discussing,
recording, creating, or simply hodling — great. But make no mistake:
Bitcoin is bigger than all of us. And, dare I say it, the current
failure of the legacy system is bigger than Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Yes, Bitcoin has the potential to fix many of the underlying issues of
our corruptible and broken systems. But we will need a plethora of
freedom-enabling technologies to win this war; tools that empower the
individual by default, by offering strong privacy guarantees,
encryption, and the freedom to use these tools without restrictions.</p>

Shill Lightly

<p>As this global pandemic sweeps through the globe, with hundreds of
thousands infected, tens of thousands dead, and millions of people out
of a job, priorities shift from trivial to existential. While difficult,
it is more important than ever to stay humble and shill lightly. It is
all too easy to alienate friends and family by offering an enthusiastic
Bitcoin lecture every time you sit at the dinner table. While enthusiasm
is laudable, I strongly believe that Bitcoin will be understood by
everyone as soon as they are ready — be it out of necessity or out of
curiosity. Yes, the timeline just got accelerated. But this is still a
marathon, not a sprint. And it might be one of many marathons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the facts of history is that battles do not stay won. Those
 that matter have to be waged again and again.”</p>

  <p><cite>Stanley Knowles</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The powers that be will neither step away willingly nor silently. And
since the battle for self-sovereignty and freedom is one that matters,
it will have to be waged again and again.</p>

Protecting An Idea Whose Time Has Come

<p>Bad actors will continually try to undermine Bitcoin, as they have tried
in the past. Unfortunately, we have good reason to believe that this
will continue. And, unfortunately, we see the trend of undermining and
maiming technology everywhere we look. If we look at the internet, for
example, we see various interest groups waging war against net
neutrality, politicians introducing nation-wide firewalls, websites
geo-blocking content, people getting arbitrarily deplatformed,
demonetized, or banned.</p>

<p>They say that nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. I
believe that Bitcoin’s time has come, and in hindsight, it will be
obvious to everyone. Before it becomes obvious, however, swathes of
people will try to distort what Bitcoin is and the ideas it represents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ideas change the world, but they do it by assuming shape, they do it
 by taking concrete form.”</p>

  <p><cite>Stanley Knowles</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Bitcoin’s form is quite concrete since its inception, it is an
abstract, intangible form, making it exceptionally hard to grasp. It
will take some time until Bitcoin is as ubiquitous as the internet is
now. This time — this window of confusion — will be used and abused
by lawmakers and charlatans alike. However, it is also a window of
opportunity. An opportunity to sharpen our tools, to prepare for the
flood, to ship the future faster than they can ban it.</p>

They Are Always Wrong

<p>Undoubtedly, there are plenty of people who don’t want Bitcoin to
succeed. They will do everything in their power to prolong the
inevitable. They are wed to the current system, gaining from its
inherent imbalance. Some are close to the monetary spigot, or willfully
ignorant, or enemies of freedom in general. Others are outright evil,
aiming to become the foot that stomps on your face, forever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They told us not to wish in the first place, not to aspire, not to
try; to be quiet, to play nice, to shoot low and aspire not at all.
They are always wrong. Follow your dreams. Make your wishes. Create
 the future. And above all, believe in yourself.”</p>

  <p><cite>Joseph Michael Straczynski</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will continue to tell us that what we are doing is a pipe dream,
that what we are aiming for is impossible, that we can’t operate outside
of the current systems. They will restrict our freedoms: our freedom to
transact, our freedom to save, our freedom to remain private. They will
tell us that certain kinds of mathematics and software are illegal. They
will continue to justify mass surveillance by trying to sell us the
illusion of safety. And they will continue to be wrong.</p>

<p>Speak up. Be outraged. Use alternatives. Build alternatives. Don’t
settle for the status quo — we can do better. Bitcoin is what we make
of it, and I can’t imagine a better set of people to realize the full
potential of this grand idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is nothing better to be on a shared mission with extraordinary
people who can be radically truthful, and radically transparent with
 each other.”</p>

  <p><cite>Ray Dalio</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stay vigilant. Stay radical. Stay true to yourself. As the world is
grinding to a halt, and the fall of Rome becomes more likely than ever,
strong characters, sound principles, and truthful conduct are
imperative.</p>

<p>The stage is set, the drama is unfolding, and as the crescendo comes we
must not give in to tyranny. The path will be twisted and bumpy, and I’m
honored to walk it to the end, with you on my side. We got this.</p>

<p>This is the famous opening statement of Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty published by Carl Schmitt in 1922. This statement offers the fundamental axiom of how all sovereign power functions, and how the sovereign exception found in emergency legal decrees allows for any sovereign to overcome and dispose of the law. In the essay the political theology of crypto I explain how cryptography negates the possibility of the sovereign exception through the banishment physical and identifying power, which thereby erodes all forms of contemporary state and legal power. I have also wrote an essay on how the metaphysical tensions between any sovereign and any subject will always result in a power dynamic that where the sovereign decision will always over come any law in times of sincere crisis or emergency, and how cryptography negates this form of power. In this essay I would like to expound more deeply upon the explicit theology of bitcoin, its formula of power, and what it means for the fate of humanity in these darkest of times.</p>



Bitcoin as Subjectivity



<p>While bitcoin is inherently an object of war, it is also an object of art. Art because it is only an expression&#8211;an object of non-tangibility, and subjective individual human values according the society we live within. However, through a Hegelian synthesis of art and war; bitcoin spills out from the noosphere as a damnation of all fiat currencies of the world of flesh and steel, and the redemptive answer we seek to rescue and restore law, economy, and order from these crises forced upon them. Through the power of cryptography, and the systems of truth that it demands; Bitcoin expresses a form of truth that no human, institution, or organization is any longer capable of anywhere the physical realm or legal jurisdictions. </p>



<p>This artistic power of war that bitcoin harnesses comes from a totalizing deterritorialization and reterritorialization (in the Deleuzian sense of the word) of the global order through the initiation of a new plane of immanence based upon cryptographic power. This plane of immanence is the renewal of a nomos (law, customs, or social cohesion) of humanity with the internet at its organizational core, and truth as the form of legitimacy. It is a novus ordo seclorum where truth, not authority, becomes the renewed source of legitimacy for all people everywhere. Through the exchange of the legitimacy of power through the sacrifice of authoritarian decrees for the truth of what is, bitcoin inverts the sovereign formula of power. </p>



<p>Both Schmitt and Agamben, two of the leading scholars on the philosophy of sovereignty, define sovereignty as a boarderline concept that is traced throughout the theory of the state. Both conclude that sovereignty finds its foundation in the authentic decision that IS the sovereign exception of the law (also know as &#8216;a state of emergency&#8217; or &#8216;sovereign crisis&#8217;), not the norm. Schmitt surmises this as, &#8220;&#8216;All law is situational law.&#8217; The sovereign produces and guarantees the situation in its totality. He has the monopoly over this last decision.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is of great importance because it is through the sovereign exception found in emergency decrees all state law is doomed to the fascism inherent to it. There is no bearing or trace of truth in the sovereign exception; only the raw authoritative power that will justify any legal exceptions. The great father of the theory of the state himself, Thomas Hobbes surmised this in Leviathan rather flippantly as;</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Auctoritas, non veritas facit legem (authority, not truth makes legitimacy)&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Schmitt, whom is among the most esteemed of legal scholars on Hobbes and his theory of the state, further surmises this point of how authority functions within the sovereign exception:</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The exception, which is not codified in the existing legal order, can at best be described as a case of extreme peril, a danger to the existence of the state&#8230; It is truly a matter of extreme emergency and how the emergency can be eliminated&#8230; From the liberal constitutional point of view, there would be no judicial competence at all. The most guidance the constitution can provide is to indicate who can act in such a case&#8230; He [the sovereign] decides if there is an extreme emergency as well as what must be done to eliminate it. Although he stands outside of the normally legally valid system, he nevertheless belongs to it, for it is he who must decide weather the constitution needs to be suspended in its entirety&#8230; Whether one has confidence and hope it can be eliminated depends on philosophical, especially on philosophical-historical or metaphysical convictions.&#8221;</p><cite>Carl Schmitt, Political Theology p. 7</cite></blockquote>



Bitcoin as Philosophical Conviction



<p>Bitcoin is the philosophical cognition of a world that has lost its nomos, where truth no longer a fact, but an opinion of power. Only in a world where seditious guile rules opening, where money is but a tool for the politically powerful, does bitcoin present its radical antithesis to the current paradigm of law, order, and sovereignty. It is the fulfillment of a crypto-anarchist critique of state, money, and legal power. </p>



<p>It is this philosophical conviction&#8211;particular the philosophical-historical  cognition of what cryptography is, how it was developed for total war, and what its development throughout the concourse of human history means; that we find a categorical imperative from which the sovereign exception can be totally and completely eliminated. Through the linguistic form that is cryptography; a demand is created that can only be answered in binary form of &#8216;yes, yes,&#8217; or &#8216;no, no,&#8217; and nothing else. It is a formula of true / false statements of output ownership protected by the magnanimity of cryptography, which creates the timechain of bitcoin, and the fulfillment of bitcoin&#8217;s oath to the cryptography that concretes it. </p>



<p>The sovereign legal form glitches out before naked truth and the total silent obligation that is the secret of all state power, arcana imperii: </p>



<blockquote><p>“The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them. For the right men have by nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by no covenant be relinquished.”</p><cite>-Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan</cite></blockquote>



<p>A world that has lost its nomos is a world where no sovereign power, institution, or government can offer even the most basic protections or assurances that comprises of the dignity of life. While the law is suppose to be the fulfillment of the most basic promise of the social contract by the sovereign, we have entered into a territory where no such promise exist. The law today is little more than authoritarian approvals, appeals, rules, and decrees; lacking even the most basic contractual functions. Through the broken oaths of sovereign powers everywhere towards the most basic aspects of the social contract; all people everywhere have been forsaken, the truth of their laws and their justice corrupted in every way.  </p>



<p>In this darkest of nights however, there is a spectacular gem of truth from which light gleams and points towards our exit from this hollowed and damned place. Bitcoin and the cryptographic breakthroughs that it has ushered in over the last decade offers us a totally new and novel strategy of human organization that breaks out of the sovereign form and can restore law, order, and economy to their rightful places. As Foucault warned us, &#8220;In political and social theory, we still have not cut off the king&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bitcoin and cryptography is a form of power that is beyond any physical force and the brutishness of any form of authoritarianism for the very real truth it must contain in order to function, and the very real protection that the cryptography it contains offers. Bitcoin is the premonition of an idea whose time has come; of a humanity that is ready to rise to its task of the abrogation of the statism, and to restore the political to its rightful place at the forefront of any law. </p>



<p>Bitcoin is a new form of political, economic, and moral organization that raises truth to being the only sacrosanct of any law. It is the philosophical cognition of a world that understands the insipid greed of men, and the infinite vice that is power. Bitcoin has enables a new form of digital organization that banishes the prattling lies of men, and demands the proof of any claim. Bitcoin does this through returning truth to its preeminent place as the foundation of all social contracts, and the meaning of truth in such agreements through the cryptographic formula of verification. </p>



Bitcoin as Political Theology 



<p>At the very end of Political Theology, Schmitt of all people, provides us with an anarchist&#8217;s critique of any sovereign decision by the very virtue of what any decision by a sovereign power must be and how it is decided:</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every claim of decision must be evil for the anarchist, because the right emerges by itself if the immanence of life is not disturbed by such claims. This radical antithesis forces him of course to decide against the decision; and this results in the odd paradox where Bakuin, the greatest anarchist of the nineteenth century, had to become in theory the theologian of the antitheological, and in practice the dictator of an antidictatorship.&#8221; </p><cite>Carl Schmitt, the final paragraph of Political Theology</cite></blockquote>



<p>It is this radical antithesis that has us also decide against the decision as well. We are products of the late 20th century; grandchildren of the spectacle society where all forms of life that would not be subjected to the machine were liquidated long ago. Now under the grimace of the total corruption of law, the complete looting of the treasuries of all peoples by political and corporate oligarchies everywhere from &#8217;emergencies&#8217; of their own creation; we find the reason for us to rise against, and choose to reclaim that which is only ours. This the reactivation of the political as the struggle for life, and the right to die trying; opens the truly political (polis) once again. </p>



<p>We understand how Bitcoin makes for the oddest of paradoxes; with anarchism becoming in theory the greatest form of &#8216;capitalism&#8217; against all states, and in practice, a dictatorship of privacy and pseudonymity which unrelentingly will not give itself to anyone but the individual. </p>



<p>Bitcoin rings with a thunderous crack, “Vires In Numeris” and becomes more powerful and fervent with each seeker that we convert. It is a political theology that restores truth as the final weapon against a system of lies, fear, and exploitation to renew the nomos of humanity, and for us all to discover that there is still a political to be claimed, but only for those who are willing to take the risk. </p>



The Revolutionary Truth Hidden in Bitcoin



<p>Having witnessed the twilight of humanity befall idiotic and empty slogans under the barbarism of statism&#8217;s vacant chanting of idiotic lies; the spectacle has envelopes all. In all of its grandeur of stupidity and lobotomization, state capitalism has fused with the totalitarian eye of the internet; idiotically  unaware of the beast it was unleashing, the prophecy it was fulfilling. </p>



<p>From the very outset, we can see the fundamental contradiction between the idea of sovereignty and the functions of cryptography. Cryptography is completely unanswerable to any sovereign power, as it lack the capacity to understand anything beyond its binary language of true or false, nor does it capitulate to any form of violence. The only laws that cryptography understands are the laws of mathematics which animates their functions.</p>



<p>By the very nature that no sovereign power can overcome the laws of mathematics that animate cryptographic systems, it points to the very nature of what crypto is and its hidden encrypted meaning. There is no emergency, war, pandemic or crisis that can stop bitcoin. Now there is only the real state of emergency to be introduced, and the final struggle in which we take our rightful place as the owner of ourselves, our political systems, and our wealth for those whom we hodl in common. </p>



<p>This is the political theology of Bitcoin, the radial promise of a machine of truth that can only speak in a binary of true or false, documenting its own claims of just that. From the outset of the creation of the timechain of Satoshi&#8217;s; Bitcoin has been nothing more than a mechanization of truth-telling of what address owns what bitcoin, and how many joules of energy were used to produce those bitcoins. </p>



<p>With each block that is built on the bitcoin timechain, it resounds and echos louder and louder against the backdrop of man and his fallen world of lies, deception, and deceit. Only in a time where man has become an insipid beast of guile and sophistry, where politicians and gangsters openly fraternize and discuss how to rape the world with no consequence to themselves, does the theology of bitcoin and the promise it cointains move from revolutionary to messianic. </p>



<p>There is no long any government anywhere that can offer the same promise as that of Bitcoin does. There is no central bank, no commodity form, no currency, no &#8216;crypto&#8216; outside of bitcoin that can offer the same assurances or security as bitcoin. The theological promise of bitcoin is that there will never be more than 21 million coins, and that there is no way to alter the supply schedule, or know exactly who owns what outputs. It is a new social contract based upon the inverted form of the sovereign dictum, with truth&#8211;not authority&#8211;being the legitimate maker of the law that is bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain.  </p>



<p>In a world where governments across the globe have promised to create infinite monetary units, swore everlasting loyalty to corporations and melomaniacs before their own citizens; the only thing left to do is refuse their broken social contract they call law, and create new ones better and more fitting for our times. Through the power, glory, and grace that is bitcoin, and for the magnanimous promise that Satoshi Nakamoto has delivered to us; bitcoin is the theological answer to the crises of our time. Its heliotropism directs us towards a world where we use cryptographic systems to verify the truth of all things, and utilize such a power to renew and recreate our systems of liberty and justice for all.</p>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s promise of a money that does not change for the light and transient causes of mortals, nor bend to the callous and pathetic will of politicians around the planet has given us a light to follow in these darkest of times. It is the oath of the cryptographic machine to itself, and its total intransigence to change for any crisis, emergency, or state of exception. Though this most wonderful and theological of tasks, Satoshi Nakamoto has created the machine of economic redemption that we need to renew our world, to free ourselves from the chains of debt and bondage that governments around the globe have forced on to all of us. It is a method to renew the social contract to its original form, and what the promise of a social contract under the rubric of truth really means.</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every man having been born free and master of himself, no one else may under any pretext whatever subject him without his consent.&#8221;</p><cite>&#8211;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract, 1762</cite></blockquote>

  ♦<p>A small group of computer illiterate politicians, driven by fear and images of dying people have thrown the United Kingdom into chaos. They did this on the evidence of a thirteen year old computer programme written in the C language that has no comments, and that no one has seen or audited to ensure it’s basic assumptions are correct. This tragic event, which has cost the United Kingdom billions, is a perfect example of why critical software must be open source and open to peer review before it is accepted for any purpose where human life is at stake.</p><p>The mindset and approach needed in life critical software is the same mentality that is needed in super high uptime software, where methodical, slow, evidence-based improvement cycles are employed, and where features are added only when it is proven that stability, compatibility and the veracity of the results are absolutely guaranteed.</p><p>This is not a new approach in software. Mission-critical systems and applications where life and death are at stake opt for professional software vendors who are very conservative and focused on stability and reliability.</p><p>These systems have uptimes (the amount of time a system is available without interruption) measured in years. Visa’s recent downtime shows they are not running systems built to this high and exacting standard, and certainly, the COVID-19 event shows that the source code being open to peer review is critical before any decision is taken based on a software model.</p>♦<p>The Imperial College pandemic predictor software isn’t an operating system, but the principles of fault tolerance and careful extension apply to it nonetheless. NASA provides a useful context here. NASA’s software fault tolerance requirements are very strict. When astronauts are involved, their lives are at stake. “Break stuff”, “I’ll comment it later, it’s old software”, in that context means “Kill People”. The software simply must work every time, as described, no compromise, no guesswork, no exceptions. There are no “do overs” or roll-backs or excuses. Guaranteed performance is possible in software, because everything about the systems, including the hardware, can be known in advance and thoroughly tested.</p><p>High fault tolerance software development has been going on for decades. It is a very well understood discipline, and the practices, methods and mentality are also established and known to work. This is why regular satellite launches work exactly as expected every time. People take them for granted, but there is a culture behind the processes that make regular flawless space launches possible that needs to be applied to any situation where life is on the line, if it is to serve everyone as is expected. It is not unreasonable to expect pandemic prediction software to never have an error in its operation. This expectation is already understood to be achievable in Air Traffic Control systems, where once again, lives are at stake.</p>♦shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/fm-atm.html<p>With the COVID-19 event, lives and money were at stake. If an incorrect over prediction of loss of life (which has just happened) is used as the basis of policy decisions, irrevocable loss to the economy will result. Interruption of services across the country can cause a cascade of further losses and unintended consequences for tens of millions of people and billions of sterling. If it is possible to build a prediction model that is reliable, that should be the goal, and no compromise should be acceptable. Certainly, no advice should ever be taken on the output of udaudited code, that has never been subject to peer review or seen by any expert software developer.</p><p>It is also clearly possible that a peer review process with that end in mind can be done; it is already successfully done in Linux and many other software projects including Bitcoin.</p><p>Pandemic prediction software is not a social network or chat app. It is a mission-critical software project that must have the same integrity and soundness as NASA spacecraft mission software.</p><p>The vast majority of software tool builders are not held to the standards that NASA and Mission-Critical, High Availability systems are held to; it is a special discipline that most people are unaware of. Participants who are not even software developers at all have no clue about this specialist field, let alone the expert field of software that isn’t life or death fault tolerant itself; that field is two times removed from them, and is not a part of their thinking at all. And this is exactly what has just happened to the British government, who were bamboozled into believing a single expert and his 13 year old undocumented code that has never been subjected to rigorous peer review.</p><p>If you like the content and feel so obliged to send some love via BTC donations you can do so at the address below:↴</p>♦♦

  <p>Trigger warning: Racism ahead.</p>
<p>By now you’ve probably seen this NYTimes article describing the horrific state of affairs at a New York City hospital. Patients dropping like flies, nurses reduced to wearing trash bags, refrigerated trucks brought in to house the overflowing dead. I was struck by the cognitive dissonance &#8212; my brother’s hospital across the city was nothing like that. His hospital admitted many COVID-19 patients, but few have been severe cases and none have died. Today Hillary Clinton (SHE’S TOTALLY RUNNING YOU GUYS) ordered pizza for everyone, and the hospital workers had a pizza party. </p>
<p>I wondered if NYT was making shit up to advance some political agenda, as they are wont to do. But then I remembered that my brother’s hospital serves a white neighborhood (New York City has over 60 hospitals). Elmhurst Hospital (the one featured in NYT) is smack-dab in the middle of an Asian community in Queens. And by Asian, I mean Southeast Asian – Thai and Vietnamese. </p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>Yet Thailand and Vietnam have had surprisingly few COVID-19 cases, and only a handful of deaths between the two countries. </p>
<p>In a Fox News column, former CDC Director Tom Frieden points out that over 40% of Americans are Vitamin D deficient. Vitamin D contributes to immune function by regulating cytokine production, so respiratory infections are more severe in those who are deficient. (Look, I know it’s Fox News, but there’s substantial peer-reviewed research backing this up.)</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>Our bodies produce Vitamin D proportional to the amount of light penetrating the skin, and light penetration is inversely proportional to melanin density. UV rays decrease as you move further from the equator, which is why Northern Europeans evolved to have fair skin. Agriculture further reduced Vitamin D intake and increased demand for UV-induced production. Polar populations (eg. Inuits) consume a diet of fish and meat – foods rich in Vitamin D – therefore they retain a darker complexion despite getting the least sunshine. [1]</p>
♦Boris Johnson tested positive for COVID-19, but he&#8217;s practically translucent so he&#8217;ll be fine.
<p>When sun people transplant to cloudy New York, a Vitamin D deficiency ensues. This is only a theory, and I’m sure there are many confounding factors. I’ll update this post as I find more evidence either for or against.</p>

These seven years are gone, spent in some of the many concrete and iron tombs that dot our countryside, spent struggling to make sense of fate and searching for meaning within the pain.</p><p>How were your last seven spent? Did you spend them in a way that reflects their scarcity and value, or were some of them wasted? How will you spend the next precious seven?</p><p>Even in prison I am faced with the same choice. Will I carry resentment or forgiveness in my heart these next seven? Will I succumb to despair or find ways to grow and flourish despite the confinement?</p><p>Every moment of every day, the choice is ours to choose life as it is, or pretend it is or should be some other way. It may be painful. It may be infuriating. It may seem utterly hopeless and ugly, but in this moment it is all we have, and we can love it if we so choose.</p><p>Choosing to love that which is unlovable transforms it, as it transforms you. It is proof that love is boundless and the highest of powers.</p><p>These next seven, I pray that we can transform a cold and dehumanizing system — one that has consumed far more than I have lost — with the power of love. I have yet to meet a person in the system — whether guard or prisoner — undeserving of love. We are all fully human, broken in our own ways, yet broken in the same way: by a lack of love.</p><p>Love does not throw life away. Love does not crush those beneath it. Love does not turn a cold shoulder or hold a grudge. Love is patient and kind. It seeks to understand and heal. Love is the key to our salvation, yet it cannot be forced or reduced to a system of rules. Love happens in that moment when you see the deep suffering of the world but keep your eyes open, when you are called to be brave and do what you can, to open your heart to others.</p><p>Love is — in my opinion — how we must spend the next seven. It is the highest value and it does not cost a thing. How will you spend the next seven?</p>♦♦♦

<p>Can we stop presenting this as a binary option? Let’s be honest about which people are actually gonna die. I&#8217;m not talking about the old or infirm. I&#8217;m talking about the subset of the population that live in dense urban outposts, the ones who commute by public transport in subterranean ant tunnels. By day, they’re cheek-to-jowl in open-plan offices, each inhaling the exhaust fumes of the next. At night, they cluster into highrises like bats in a cave. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extreme measures to flatten the virus “curve” is sensible-for a time-to stretch out the strain on health infrastructure. But crushing the economy, jobs and morale is also a health issue-and beyond. Within a very few weeks let those with a lower risk to the disease return to work.</p>
<p>&mdash; Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) March 23, 2020</p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>See? Not you. You bugged out months ago to your sprawling estate in the Hamptons. You’ve never set foot in an open office; you’ve got your corner suite in Greenwich. And even if you do contract the virus, you’ll be fine. Virologists refer to infectious diseases as “poor man’s disease”. Cuz rich people don’t die from viral infections. </p>
<p>You think Prince Charles or Sophie Trudeau are gonna die? Pfft. Cancer, now that’s a rich man’s disease. Cancer doesn’t care about wealth. That’s why everyone cares about cancer.</p>
<p>So your chances of dying from COVID-19 are veritably nil. But in an economic recession, YOU have the most to lose. In absolute terms, that is. Why should your stock portfolio suffer for the shitty life choices of others?</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>Then again, maybe you’re one of those bat-colony people. The ones who live and work in close quarters with proles. Maybe you don’t want your Grandma or anybody else’s Grandma killed by a virus. Maybe you know someone who tested positive for COVID-19, or you follow someone on Twitter who tested positive, or maybe you’ve enjoyed a movie starring someone who tested positive. For you, it hits close to home. This shit is real.</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>Then you see this Oxford study that says coronavirus may have already infected half the UK population. And WSJ says we’ve been overestimating the fatality rate. And look, New York just saw a decrease in the number of new confirmed cases. Coincidentally, doctors have been instructed to stop testing patients unless the patient requires hospitalization. The assumption is that New Yorkers have all been infected already. Maybe that was the peak. Maybe the disease has spread far and wide, and we’ve all developed herd immunity.</p>
<p>Soon, instead of reporting on every tragic death, the papers will begin telling triumphant stories of patients who fought the virus and made a full recovery. Deaths become statistics. You scroll through Twitter and no one’s talking about COVID-19. Toilet paper and hand sanitizer are back on store shelves. Election season regains dominance over national attention. One day, like a miracle, the virus disappears. </p>
<p>And then you realize that this was never about saving lives versus the economy. There was never really a choice at all. Civilizations around the world have spent thousands of years telling stories of angry vengeful gods, unseen and unpredictable forces, stories written by the rich and powerful persuading the proletariat to stay scared and docile. It was never about coronavirus. It was all just a bunch of fanciful storytelling to make you soft and pliable, numb to the fact that you were gonna kneel before zog no matter what.</p>

<p>Last week, a coterie of the biggest tech platforms announced that they would be teaming up to combat misinformation about coronavirus and the Covid-19 illness it causes.  We’re from Google and we’re here to help &#8212; the most terrifying words in the English language.</p>
<p>Sure enough over the weekend, blogging site Medium “helpfully” removed a longform post by an armchair epidemiologist who was a bit too optimistic in interpreting COVID-19 data. </p>
<p>The underlying data was correct – it was his opinion that was wrong.</p>
<p>The post (which now reappears on Zerohedge, whose Twitter account was also helpfully banned for COVID-19 misinformation) concludes that school closings and stay-at-home measures do more harm than good, and that we should all calm down and stop the hysteria.</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>Look, I sympathize with cities like New York where hospitals are inundated and they really need everyone to comply and shelter in place. At the same time, censorship doesn’t work. Half of Americans already distrust media coverage of coronavirus; censoring alternative viewpoints is only going to make that worse. When you censor someone, they instantly go from armchair epidemiologist to SILENCED WHISTLEBLOWER.</p>
<p>Censorship is the ultimate vindication that you’ve spoken truth to power. Remember that Google diversity memo? The author was fired after publicly criticizing the company’s reverse-discrimination efforts. After the fallout, James Damore took to Twitter using the handle @Fired4Truth and republished his document at Fired4Truth.com. No, Damore wasn’t fired for telling the truth – he was fired for causing a PR nightmare. But just as everyone is the hero in their own story, every censored voice is the silenced truthseeker in his own narrative.</p>
<p>If your spouse asks you whether her dress makes her look fat and you answer truthfully, you’ll be sleeping on the couch for the next two weeks. And no, you weren’t banished for “truth” – even though it might feel that way! – you were banished for causing marital discord.</p>
<p>And so, the Evidence-Over-Hysteria post wasn’t removed for factual (in)correctness, it was removed because it racked up several million pageviews and encouraged people to question mandatory shelter-in-place orders. Instead of censoring disruptive posts, it might be worth pondering why people are so skeptical of prevailing narratives in the first place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compiling a list of the official misinformation from press &amp; state.</p>
<p>&#8211; Flu is more serious<br>&#8211; Travel bans are overreacting<br>&#8211; Only Wuhan visitors at risk<br>&#8211; Avoiding handshakes is paranoid<br>&#8211; Virus is contained<br>&#8211; Tests are available<br>&#8211; Masks don&#39;t help</p>
<p>What else?</p>

  <p>this is your brain on central banking, regulatory capture, and financialization.</p><p>Allen Farrington &amp; Sacha Meyers</p>♦photo by Roberto Júnior, via Unsplash<p>The everything bubble has popped. In the end it wasn’t PE ratios that imploded under their own stupendous highs, nor the conceptual insanity of negative rates triggering bank runs. The Euro didn’t fall apart (yet) and there was no hyperinflation (yet). It was an “exogenous shock” wot done it. We encourage readers to read this phrase with maximal eye-rolling sass, and to recall when we discuss the kind of macroeconomic macrobullshit that got us into this mess, which works perfectly well in every conceivable circumstance other than contact with the real world.</p><p>This puts us in a tragicomic position. In order to deal with this horrifically dangerous “exogeny”, we seemingly need to go into overdrive on the exact same measures that made us vulnerable in the first place: we need to print money like there is no tomorrow and throw it at everything that moves. That is literally the plan. That’s how we deal with emergencies now.</p><p>Money printer go BRRR</p><p>This essay is about the bizarre reaction we have noticed from a solid majority of the professional commentariat to the effect that this is the inevitable result of capitalism run wild. We are not sure what these people mean, or even think they mean, by “capitalism”. If they mean, “the regime of political economy dominant in the West since 1971 and particularly acute since 2009”, then they are correct on a technicality, but they are abusing the word. If “capitalism” means anything, that meaning ought to at least include the notion of preserving and growing capital. It can include other nasty bits and bobs, for sure, but it must at least include this.</p><p>The preservation and growth of capital is not happening, nor has it happened since before the dominance of the regime now misleadingly bearing this name. And so, it is somewhat concerning that people are lining up to both defend and attack “capitalism”, when the object of discussion could hardly be further from any worthwhile meaning of the word but is rather better described as: boosting aimless consumption, primarily with uncollateralised debt, by destroying the price signals for capital and depleting its stock. This may well be necessary for the sake of public health — we are not doctors, nor experts in biology, epidemiology, virology, or any similar field, and so we do not deny the merits of such an approach nor offer any views on their likely effectiveness. We just beg for the proper economic analysis of why we are in this position, and do our best to provide it.</p><p>This is your brain on central banking, regulatory capture, and financialization. This is not capitalism.</p><p>Money Is A Story</p>♦photo by Josh Appel, via Unsplash<p>There is a vast literature on the question of ‘what is money?’ We present a simplified version for the purpose of establishing enough key points to keep the discussion moving along. Our account is by no means exhaustively wide nor exhaustively deep, but it is correct enough within the realms of what we cover. Readers looking for a more thorough treatment are encouraged to bookmark Shelling Out by Nick Szabo, Andreas Antonopoulos’s talk The Stories We Tell About Money, or for a longer, more academic read, The Theory of Money and Credit by Ludwig von Mises, and The Ethics of Money Production by Jörg Guido Hülsmann. But for the time being …</p><p>Money is a story. It is a story of what work has been done on credit that is yet to be redeemed. It is the Schelling point for universal credit. It is an IOU that everybody is willing to redeem (primarily because everybody is willing to redeem it) and hence that at every instance of its transfer is re-ordained with the ascription of economic value to work actually performed. Note that money is not a social construct, a collective delusion, or any other such denigration that snidely implies that nothing about money really matters and we could reinvent it all tomorrow if we wanted to. Money may be a story, but the qualities of the story matter a great deal. The truer the story, the better.</p><p>By ‘true’, we ought to mean that the process of transferring money has, and is trusted to have always had, the characteristics of censorship resistance and integrity assurance. We can think of this in cryptographic terms, as there is a ready analogy to be made to ensuring the security and validity of network communications. Transferring money is sending a message through the network of economic exchange. It is ‘censorship resistant’ if Alice knows her message is to Bob and only Bob; it is not diverted to Charlie, nor is it destroyed. It is ‘integrity assured’ if Bob knows the message is from Alice and only Alice; it is not really from Charlie, nor also to Dorothy, nor really from nobody at all.</p><p>When money is printed — whether this be bank notes or lines in a database — this is violating integrity assurance. It is equivalent to the printer extending themselves credit on the unwilling, and mostly unknowing, behalf of everybody. No work has been done that anybody is willing to redeem. No economic value has been created, or contracted to be created, to match the token now in circulation. Bob does not know his message of value transfer is from Alice and only Alice; it is not from anybody. The issuer has executed a man-in-the-middle attack on the structure of economic exchange.</p><p>And note this isn’t an old man yells at cloud rant against money creation in general in which we insist all economic activity must be conducted with gold. The money created by credit extension can be perfectly legitimate if the risk of the maturity transformation is priced freely by interest, borne by the equity holders of the lending institution, and mitigated with collateral they understand. But it is not if the risk is priced by political expediency, borne by nobody, and collateralised by everybody. It also doesn’t hurt to have the lenders know and consent to what is happening with their deposits, rather than suffering from the collective delusion that their funds are ‘in the bank’.</p><p>We will return below to the implications of taking the latter course of action. For now, bear in mind as we continue that money is universal credit and that its supply in a free market is a reflection of the reality of how much valuable work has been done. As Oliver Wendell Holmes put it,</p><blockquote>“We must think things not words, or at least we must constantly translate our words into the facts for which they stand, if we are to keep the real and the true.”</blockquote><p>There may be valid social or political reasons to compromise the censorship resistance or integrity assurance of money. Fighting a deadly virus might well be one of them. But there will be consequences; people will believe a story that simply isn’t true, but will act as if it is. We are currently living through the mother of all such consequences.</p><p>Stocks And Flows</p>♦photo by Anders Ipsen, via Unsplash<p>Another decent definition of money is the most liquid form of capital. Although this is rather a circular definition, as ‘liquidity’ is traditionally conceived of as a measure of how quickly and easily an asset can be converted to ‘money’. It still tautologically works, as money can be converted to money in zero time and with zero difficulty, but it deserves to be padded out. We can say that money is the most salable asset: the asset that emerges with the property of being the most widely accepted in exchange for other assets, not to be consumed, but to retain value for later exchange. Note that, in a barter economy of only consumable goods, money adds little value beyond the administrative: it becomes easier to calculate exchange rates. Where money adds immense social value is in calibrating the exchange rates of goods that cannot be consumed, but rather are used to create consumable goods, or are used to create goods that are used to create consumable goods, and so on.</p><p>This all points to a higher analysis; money itself is not the most important aspect of capitalism. Nor is trade, nor markets, nor profits, nor even assets, but capital. ‘goods that are used to create consumable goods’ are a form of capital, but really, we mean something less tangible than any of the former; a kind of economic potential energy stored in the transformation of materials into higher and higher forms of complex good, but always ready to be rereleased to work again the same process of transformation. Seen this way, capital is not any particular thing or even behaviour — it can exist only as an emergent property of a social system in which the exchange of shares of ownership of private assets is seamless.</p><p>Capital is a stock. Its dimension is currency. It exists (and in theory could be measured) at any instantaneous point in time. Money and assets are also stocks, meaning they too can be measured at any point in time. But the numbers alone cannot have any independent meaning because they are dependent on the unit chosen to measure the dimension: Dollars. The number will be different in Euros, Yen, or Bitcoin.</p><p>Such measures as ‘revenue’, ‘profits’, and with a little leeway even ‘trade’ are flows. Their dimensions are currency over time. There is no such thing as instantaneous profit. Profit happens over time. This means that the numbers representing profit, and all flows, are sensitive to changing the unit measuring the currency, and the unit measuring the time. To avoid confusion on this account, we will assume Dollars per year as a default, but will at various points toy with this concept to make different points clear.</p><p>This might seem like semantics, but the distinction is key as follows: you need stocks to create flows, and you need flows to replenish stocks. Our entire analysis of how bankrupt (morally as well as factually) our financial system is can more or less be derived from the appreciation that this simple maxim is not widely understood. What does it mean more practically?</p><p>“The economy” is an aggregation of businesses, which are helpfully split into financial and nonfinancial (we hate the expression “the economy” and will endeavour not to use it unless avoiding it would be unbearably clumsy. It is a noun when it should really be a verb, because the way it is used refers to a flow, not a stock). Financial businesses oversee the allocation of liquid capital by matching the preferences of contributors of capital with regards to perceived risk, timeframe, and so on, with nonfinancial business projects with appropriate characteristics. Nonfinancial businesses turn liquid capital into illiquid capital — higher and higher forms of complex good — in an attempt to satisfy a perceived customer demand. If they make revenue, they are correct in a demand existing for such a good or service. If they make a profit, they have satisfied this demand efficiently; they have produced more than they have consumed. Profit is both payment to the providers of capital, and the opportunity to reinvest without requiring further external financing.</p><p>Nonfinancial businesses cannot create either revenues or profits without first being provided with capital. This might be as simple as saying that you can’t sell goods without first buying them or making them, and you can’t pay for the raw materials before you have made a profit unless you first have financing. Or it might be more complicated, but also more obviously linked to wealth creation, in that you need to buy a machine (a higher order capital good) that takes raw materials as an input and churns out something more complicated and more valuable. Clearly you don’t want the machine for its own sake; you want it for what it will produce. The machine has to be purchased with liquid capital, and then exists as illiquid capital. It can be liquidated if desired (i.e. sold for cash), but its primary value is as a form of economic potential energy. It is a stock that creates flows.</p><p>You need stocks to create flows, and you need flows to replenish stocks. You need financing to start a business, and you need profits to maintain one. Profits are required to pay back the financing, and will eventually give the business owner the ability to eschew financing entirely and maintain the business’s capital requirements sustainably and internally. This is as true for a single business as when aggregated to “the economy”.</p><p>The health of a single business, and the health of the aggregation of all businesses, should not be measured by ‘growth’ in revenue, or in profits, or even in capital, but in the ratio of profits to capital. The rate of return. And ideally, it should be (geometrically) averaged over a very long time — not only can no meaningful investment take place over a single year (accruals-based accounting exists in the first place to give at least some useful information over shorter time periods) but the length of credit cycles will obscure what is really happening over as long as ten or twenty years. A high rate of return is a high flow to stock ratio. If all the flow is reinvested, it will be the rate of increase of the stock, and reflect the meaningful growth of “the economy”.</p><p>Recall once more the ‘dimensionality’ argument: the ratio of profit one year to profit the year before is not even ‘growth’. It is an ‘increase’. Return on capital is a growth rate. Its units are one over time. Economic wellbeing and sustainability can only be sensibly measured with aggregated return on capital. Unsurprisingly, this is not at all how anybody does so …</p><p>‘GDP Growth’, And Other Useless Metrics</p>♦photo by Fleur, via Unsplash<p>Widespread misunderstandings of money and capital, and of stocks and flows, come together to form a dangerous cocktail with GDP growth. In understanding how GDP is commonly discussed, and why that discussion betrays a stunning ignorance of money and capital, we will be in a position to evaluate the crisis we now face. This section marks the middle of the essay: the turning point between theory and practical analysis.</p><p>As we see it, there are (at least) three problems with ‘GDP growth’, all of which have some bearing on the crisis we now face, and which we will discuss in turn: i) the ‘economic wellbeing’ it claims to measure is in fact unmeasurable, ii) the ‘economic wellbeing’ it claims to measure is politically and socially irrelevant, and iii) it is not a ‘growth rate’ at all.</p><p>i) the ‘economic wellbeing’ it claims to measure is in fact unmeasurable: GDP is the total monetary value of goods and services produced in a region over a period. If somebody says “the economy” grew by 2%, they likely mean that the quantity of goods and services produced increased by that amount. Of course, not every quantity grew by exactly that amount. Some might even be shrinking. What matters is the total monetary value. When there is one fewer unit of A, costing $1, but one more unit of B, costing $2, GDP still increases by $1.</p><p>So far so good. This certainly seems ‘measurable’, so what’s the problem? Over time, human ingenuity comes up with new or improved goods and services. When that happens, there isn’t merely one more of A or B. There is something else entirely: C. GDP, which so far tracked how much the production of A and B increased, now also tracks C. Given enough time, demand for A, B, and C might disappear, so that GDP only consists of X, Y, and Z — none of which existed when records started. How can we then say that ‘the economy’ grew when it doesn’t make more of what it used to?</p><p>The unsatisfactory answer is that when C was invented, it had a market price which could be compared to those of A and B. In that way, the comparison stands. But this exchange rate between A and C only came into existence after C was invented. Beforehand, no amount of money could buy C. Innovation expanded our opportunity set so that capital could be allocated to the production of something new. The price of C only reflects the opportunity cost of its production and consumption after its discovery, not the value embedded in the discovery itself. There are no exchange rates to the future.</p><p>The value of discoveries compounds over time. A practical illustration of long-term ‘GDP growth’ makes its nonsensical nature plain. According to GDP, individual Vietnamese on average earn as much today as Americans did in the 1880s. Yet the Vietnamese have the same life expectancy as Americans did in the 1980s. Today’s Vietnamese live in a world of smartphones and penicillin, whereas 1880s Americans lived in an age of candlelight and often-fatal bacterial infections. The monetary value of their income might be considered comparable by economists, but that is because they do not, and cannot, measure the constant improvements brought upon by human ingenuity.</p><p>Economies do not ‘grow’, they ‘change’. And you can’t measure counterfactuals in Dollars.</p><p>ii) the ‘economic wellbeing’ it claims to measure is politically and socially irrelevant: we encourage readers to look into the blog post Democratic Domestic Product by Ole Peters, and the wider Ergodicity Economics research programme of which he is a part. But we will summarise the salient points here.</p><p>GDP growth is the growth in wealth of the average person, rather than the average growth in wealth of a person (the latter is Peters’ proposal for ‘DDP’). GDP growth is a plutocratic measure, that is indifferent to the higher moments of the distribution from which it is drawn. It is entirely possible for the wealth of every single person bar one to go down, while GDP growth goes up. In fact, something not too dissimilar to this seems to have happened in Europe and the US since the financial crisis. GDP keeps on climbing while median measures of income, disposable income, assets, net financial wealth, and more, have gone sideways or even down. The gains have increasingly been concentrated in higher and higher brackets of existing wealth, to the point where, at certain cut-offs, more than 100% of the gains have gone to some upper bracket. In other words, some groups are in fact getting poorer, but other groups are getting richer at a faster rate, such that GDP still grows.</p><p>While there is reason to believe that technological changes and geopolitics have contributed to this phenomenon, we will explain below why we think this can largely be explained by state enforcement of the dominant regime of political economy, and its abject ignorance of the principles of money, capital, and returns.</p><p>iii) it is not a ‘growth rate’ at all: as above, it is an ‘increase’. It is a difference between two flows. A growth rate is a return; a flow over a stock. Moreover, GDP isn’t even the correct flow one would need to compute a relevant return, because it is the aggregation of revenue, not of profit. By religiously focusing on this entirely irrelevant metric, it is almost trivially easy to end up doing both of the following:</p><p>· encouraging profitless revenue, which indicates a real demand, but an inefficient use of resources in satisfying that demand. Capital is one such resource — possibly the most important — hence:</p><p>· encouraging destruction or consumption of capital; or, a short-term high of consumption at the expense of the long-term ability to produce what we might like to consume. Think of a farmer eating seed rather than planting it. His consumption increases, but eventually he loses the ability to consume at all.</p><p>Equally useless without the proper context is stock market capitalisation. Obviously, it is more or less a good thing for stocks to go up, because it means that lenders of capital are getting a return, and companies that are proving the viability of their economic proposition can raise capital more cheaply. But there must be underlying economic success for this to be justified. Individual companies can always see their valuations grow out of line with their fundamentals, either on hype or entirely on merit as their prospects for the future are seen to be improving. But if valuations across the board are marching upwards vastly out of line with rates of return on capital, never mind with increases in cash flows or book value of equity, something is wrong.</p><p>There are two obvious contenders for what might be wrong, and which have the potential to reinforce one another in a deadly spiral: inflation and speculation.</p><p>By inflation, we mean to ignore such bullshit euphemisms as ‘quantitative easing’ and ‘market support’ and to direct the reader’s attention to the simple fact of artificial money being pumped into financial markets to increase prices beyond what reality is doing its best to get them to show. When prices go up because a currency is being debased, that is inflation. It might make a social and political difference if the price increases are in milk and bread, or housing and healthcare, rather than in financial assets, but economically it is irrelevant. It reflects only what the artificial money was first used to buy. Eventually it will dissipate to all goods and services. We will return below to the broader consequences of artificial money being directed specifically to financial assets, but for the time being, we simply mean to point out that the prices are fake. They do not reflect reality.</p><p>By ‘speculation’ we should be clear that we do not mean anything intrinsically negative. Speculation is usually rolled out by financially illiterate opportunistic rabble-rousers as a culprit for the consequences of intervention-induced market collapses, when in fact it is more than likely that speculation was trying to direct prices to reflect reality while artificial money was pushing in the other direction. We mean simply that financial market inflation can induce a certain kind of speculation that is unhealthy. If it becomes clear enough to market participants that the artificial money firehose will not be turned off, this actually reduces the incentive to speculate against the fake signals being provided by inflation and start contributing to inflation instead. In reviewing an early draft of this essay, Nic Carter kindly drew our attention to the large numbers of so-called ‘permabears’ who flipped long around 2016 when they realised this thing wasn’t going to stop.</p><p>Say you are a pension fund that needs an 8% return to meet its liabilities without difficulty. And say that stocks have been inflated to the point that you can in all honesty expect only a 2% return over the long run from here given reasonable assumptions about valuation metrics returning to something sensible at some point. You might be tempted to look for other asset classes that are not so corrupted. But if you are reasonably sure that artificial money will keep pushing prices up for longer than the time horizon over which you would otherwise expect a reversion, then it might actually be sensible to stay invested and get your 8% from inflation alone. This way, those who might otherwise be incentivised to contribute to correcting the effect of price manipulation are actually incentivised to contribute to reinforcing it, if the manipulation is strong enough in the first place.</p><p>When this vicious cycle gets into full gear, the idea of measuring ‘economic wellbeing’ solely by the increase (not growth) in stock market valuations, may be even more misguided than by that of GDP ‘growth’. It is not a returns metric. It says nothing about sustainability and in this specific scenario (the one we have been in for at least ten years) it is virtually guaranteed to be concealing highly unsustainable misdirection of capital, if not its outright destruction.</p><p>What Would Happen In An Economically Healthy Capitalist Society</p>♦photo by Brooke Larke, via Unsplash<p>Lots of things. We will go through some of them relatively quickly as they are more or less common sense and fall out naturally from the above discussion.</p><p>· You would be able to preserve wealth in money. Money is the stored and accepted value of work done in the past, redeemable for goods and services in the present or future. Money should not constantly decline in value. There are considerations regarding the conditions of credit extension and systemic leverage that make the issue more complicated and that we do not want to get into — but, all else equal, over a long enough period of time you would expect the purchasing power of money to increase roughly in line with aggregate return on capital, because the same past work done now has access to a greater amount of goods and services.</p><p>· This means you would only lend capital to risky enterprises because you want to, not because you have to in order to have any hope of preserving your wealth. This in turn means capital would be priced so as to accurately reflect society’s preferences for saving and consumption, and investment projects would be coordinated accordingly.</p><p>· Governments would either run surpluses or it would be acknowledged and accepted that they could institute emergency taxes. Printing money is a stealth tax on wealth that disincentivises holding money, as above. It has the same first-order effect on wealth transfers, but has hidden second-order effects of misdirecting capital due to political expediency and cowardice.</p><p>· Relatedly, governments would (or should) therefore be incentivised to act in the public interest at all times. They should not be beholden to stoking financial market inflation at all costs. They should not be ‘bought’ by Wall Street, nor have their banking laws written by bankers and their airline safety regulations written by unsafe airlines. If that means instituting economically disastrous short-term measures for the sake of public health (and to avert even more disastrous long-term economic results) there should be no wavering and no discussion. It should be done, and prices should be allowed to adjust to reflect the new reality without political consequence.</p><p>· Investment decisions could legitimately include greater social and environmental considerations without risking fiduciary liability. If you are constantly incentivised to increase short term profits, you will consider firing everybody and moving production to China. If you are incentivised to increase long term returns, you can double down on investment in your existing workforce and stomach the costs of more environmentally friendly inputs to production. The latter is clearly a broader social good, but is still easy enough to motivate and justify given the effects would otherwise be worst felt in the local communities where the workforce is based.</p><p>· Individuals and businesses would buy a lot more insurance. Preservation of wealth would be more important than the desperate need to grow it to stay ahead of inflation, and so the prudence of insurance against any and every “exogenous” disaster would be incentivised. Or, rather, it is obviously sensible in the first place, and so it wouldn’t be incentivised against.</p><p>· There would be no bailouts. Nothing would be “systemically important” because disasters — even “exogenous” ones — would be adequately insured against. When a business fails, its (willing) contributors of equity would be wiped out, its (willing) contributors of debt would not make whole, and its remaining liabilities would be covered by insurance. Government could even take a far more expansive role in protecting consumers in such cases given, i) it can afford it, and ii) there is no competing incentive to side with business, nor a moral hazard to side with both but encourage recklessness nonetheless.</p><p>· Company executives would be incentivised by long-term measures of growth in real value, not short-term measures of increases in per-share value. To be clear, buybacks are, in theory, a valuable tool to price capital properly. We do not argue against them in general, but we acknowledge that, in practice, they are often used as a means to enhance the latter rather than the former. We argue below this behaviour is entirely a pathology of the dominant regime of political economy of which this essay is a critique.</p><p>What Has Happened In Real Life</p>♦photo by Hermes Rivera, via Unsplash<p>We have spent the past ten years working on the assumption that the supply and price of money is unimportant, that maximising the increase in GDP and stock market valuations is best for “the economy”, that it doesn’t matter that these numbers do not represent rates of return, and that ‘the average person’ is a meaningful concept whose economic wellbeing we can measure. This is your brain on central banking, regulatory capture and financialization. There is far too much to cover so we will stick to what you might have seen in the news lately.</p><p>Everybody Gets Levered Up The Wazoo: if you can’t save because money does not retain value, then you have to be fully invested. If capital has all been misallocated such that price signals are unreliable and losses are artificially sustained, then any minor advantage has to be levered to achieve a satisfactory return. And if interest rates are artificially low, this might even seem like it makes good business sense.</p><p>If all your competitors are levered to the hilt and you aren’t, even though you can optically afford it, you will be outcompeted. So you have to do it too. You can’t compete prudently in the long run if your competitors spend you to death on cheap capital in the short run. Even if there are no competitive pressures, there will be pressures from shareholders. As with speculation and buybacks above, there are perfectly sensible ways for businesses to use leverage to beneficially affect capital allocation, for themselves and for the market at large. But usually, this is because the company has visibility on likely variations in cashflows and slack to absorb shocks — not despite having no visibility and no slack.</p><p>There are forms of leverage other than debt. You can think of leverage more abstractly as an induced vulnerability to shocks — “exogenous” or otherwise — in exchange for a magnified gain in their absence. The more debt you have, the more vulnerable you are to shocks to cash flow, because you have no choice but to pay the interest. But in many ways, other vulnerabilities to shocks can be even more dangerous. At least debt is relatively transparent: you can infer from the financial statements how much of a shock you can afford. Other vulnerabilities are less inherently knowable. Supply chain decisions can be a form of leverage: to get the absolute lowest costs that can be sweated out your setup, you could choose a single supplier (say, in China) and instruct them to deliver right on time to drive your carried inventory to effectively zero.</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>Being able to seal borders without crippling your economy.

There is no slack. It is exceedingly fragile. Which is more or less what we are seeing now, as Preston Byrne points out above. Not only are entire sectors grinding to a halt because they are operationally levered to the eyeballs towards one specific task and cannot adjust to even mildly different circumstances, never mind a quarantine, but this setup is precisely why we are in these circumstances in the first place. If we could have cut all contact with China in January there would be no crisis whatsoever. For some (cough cough US and UK) this would have been meant a reduction in imported tat. For others (cough cough Italy and Iran) this would rather more seriously have meant risking forfeiting strategic assets financed with Chinese debt under the Belt and Road Initiative.

As is declining to purchase insurance it would really be prudent to hold. If the need to be levered gets desperate enough, many will even consider selling insurance as a way to top up returns, clearly indifferent to the long-term implications of this insanity, because the short-term pressures are too intense to care. The behavioural pull here should not be underestimated. If absolutely everybody is selling insurance, you might want to consider buying some, and yet this takes a special resolve.</p><p>Universa Investments exists more or less exclusively to run this trade. Do you think you could mimic them? Really? You are willing to lose a little bit more every day for ten years, waiting for the everything bubble to maybe, one day, pop? Or will you cave after 2 or 3? Will you get up and dance to the song that never ends? We haven’t seen any numbers but we imagine the past two months have been quite spectacular for Universa. Rumour has it 1,000% in February and 3,000% and counting in March. Not to detract from their genuinely brilliant analysis and essential work for their clients, but we can’t help but feel it is somewhat sad that, bet against absolutely everybody’s desperation, ignorance, and stupidity, is a viable strategy for a hedge fund. That said, it may be sad, but it is true, and we should not downplay or envy the valuable public service of those who pursue such a strategy successfully.</p><p>The Cantillon Effect Is Justified As A Public Good: The Cantillon Effect refers to the phenomenon that debased money is not distributed equally throughout society all at once, but is introduced in a specific place, giving its initial holders illegitimate purchasing power at everybody else’s expense. By the time the inflation washes through “the economy”, those who receive the artificial money last have had reduced purchasing power for as long as it takes them to at best catch up with everybody else. Also, as this is done sneakily, the new money isn’t priced in properly either, giving the Cantillon insiders an additional advantage. This is all rather amusing when you consider the likely hyperbolic response of financial elites and economists to the idea of ‘helicopter money’. For all its flaws, helicopter money is a substantially better and fairer idea than quantitative easing.</p><p>As per the dominant regime of political economy, the artificial money is introduced to the financial sector by means of ‘open market operations’ in which central banks add assets to their balance sheets in order either to boost the prices of financial assets, lower the borrowing costs of corporations, or both at once. This is justified because ‘growing GDP’ and ‘supporting the stock market’ are thought to be legitimate political goals — price signals, capital allocation, and rates of return be damned.</p><p>This means that everybody whose income derives from the face value of financial instruments benefits at everybody else’s expense. There is a decent argument to be made that, actually, the pensions of at least every past and present government employee are entirely dependent on these valuations, which justifies the social and political goal in the first place. But this obscures a crucial point: there is an extremely important difference between benefitting from increases in valuation because your wealth is tied up in those assets, and because your income derives from periodically skimming the value of those assets. Those in the latter position are actually in charge of all of this financialised, regulatorily-captured mess, and yet when challenged will wax lyrical about the savings of all those hard-working men and women in the former camp, pulling on your heartstrings until they snap.</p><p>Those in the latter camp tend to be exceedingly well-off already: bankers, market makers, hedge funds, mutual fund managers; the derivative professional services of each of the above: lawyers, accountants, corporate managers; corporate executives incentivised by options, hence in turn incentivised to buy back stock — not because the stock is undervalued and capital pricing in aggregate will benefit from this decision, but because valuation is not considered at all, and the intention is to temporarily boost the stock price in time for the options to mature and be cashed in. Each of the above makes out like bandits while little old retired schoolteacher grandmas are left holding the bag when markets inevitably collapse and their pensions evaporate.</p><p>And of course, when that happens, who can we expect to go on CNBC and beg Congress for bailouts but precisely the corporate executives, bankers, and the like, whose maintaining of this regime of political economy caused it all in the first place. In dire enough straits, some executive teams will have even have the stone cold cojones to buy back $3bn of stock with more or less the entirety of their company’s free cash flow, take combined options packages worth over $10m marked-to-market in one fiscal year, no doubt boosted higher in time for payday by all these buybacks, and then hold their employees’ jobs hostage in their negotiations for government bailouts:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>BREAKING: United Airlines CEO threatens big job cuts if company doesn&#39;t receive &quot;sufficient government support by the end of March&quot; t.co/uAqJuiXyQb</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@CNBCnow</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>These people’s wealth is determined almost exclusively by how high they can push flows — stocks and rates of return be damned.

Their savings have been stealthily taxed and handed to the already rich, while their everyday costs have gone up to reflect the dissipation of this inflation.

But so are securities backed by mortgages on the properties of apple and orange farmers. Leading up to the last financial crisis, banks selling MBSs were contributing to GDP growth. They were incentivised to do so because their income came from skimming flows rather than growing stocks, and were allowed to flagrantly lie about the risks of doing so by captured regulators. Of course, the products themselves were largely highly toxic — not only did they not create any real wealth, they encouraged the staking of real wealth against synthetic versions of the same underlying toxic assets. Capital was depleted, but only in the very long run, long after the banks had taken their cut and passed on the hot potato (well, most banks).</p><p>But that cut was growth! GDP went up! Bank stocks went up! Bonuses went up! Everything went up until suddenly it went down to lower than where it started. This might seem hopelessly irrational, and in one sense it is. But that is not the sense in which anybody is incentivised to behave in a world in which returns must chase inflation, insurance must be sold rather than bought, and you know full well you will be bailed out if (or when) you blow up. And not this is not just banks: United Airlines is in an arguably conceptually identical position. It financialised its balance sheet (woo hoo growth!) for little reason other than to enrich its executives, blew up (but but but exogenous!), and now wants a bailout.</p><p>Nor is it all banks. It is perfectly possible to run a bank responsibly amidst such insanity. It just takes ethics and guts. Legendary BB&amp;T CEO John Allison wrote an entire book about how flagrantly unethical banking and regulatory practices caused the previous crisis while he ran his bank well, including being subject to a Treasury shakedown to take TARP funds it didn’t need in order to help the likes of Citigroup and Merrill Lynch look less like dangerous lunatics. Readers might see the unfortunately suggestive title of this book and think Allison is solely proposing greater privatisation of gains. It is far more accurate to say he is proposing less socialisation of losses. Amen to that.</p><p>Ever eager to prevent the last crisis (or to be seen to have retroactively and heroically prevented the last crisis) much of the pre-GFC financialization has since been made illegal. And yet financialization continues apace. Imagine what grifting, off-balance sheet, 2010s shenanigans are on the cusp of seeing the light of day!</p>♦Source: US Bureau of Economic Analysis<p>Consider the chart above of finance as a proportion of US GDP. Something is wrong here. Finance certainly ought to grow: if done properly it contributes enormously to societal wellbeing by allocating capital efficiently. This is all well and good. But it should not grow faster than everything else, because it typically charges a percentage fee of the face value of the assets or securities that pass through its allocating hands. For finance to consistently grow as a proportion of GDP, either it is simply upping its take — which might be reasonable within bounds, but raises questions of adequate competition in the sector and of possible regulatory capture — or it is making more and more MBS-like time bombs. It is spinning off flows of toxic financial exposure, of whose values it is taking a cut but not a stake, that don’t actually contribute to real economic returns, and hence to the aggregate growth in the stock of capital.</p><p>Once again, it isn’t just banks. In recent years this attitude seems to have firmly entrenched itself in just about every industry. Credit card income represents 40% of Macy’s profit. Patreon is now basically a payday lender. These aren’t extraordinary cases. They are exactly what you would expect when interest rates are artificially low for long enough: any business with enough customers and enough data on their customers’ purchasing behaviour can very likely borrow at low (fake) rates and effectively lend to customers at higher ones.</p>♦You had a little typo there, Apple, but we fixed it for you<p>This arbitrage can even give them the leeway to make a loss on their actual good or service, furthering the widespread misallocation of capital away from things that can be sustainably profitable and towards facilitating indebted consumption of garbage:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>TheFiatStandard Business model: 1- Find anything to sell, preferably at a loss 2- Borrow from Fed at 2% ir 3- Give credit cards to customers at ~20% ir 4- People are in debt for stupid things they don&#39;t need, but it&#39;s ok because money loses value anyway &amp;amp; 5- GDP number go up</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@saifedean</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>The obsession with GDP growth that fuels financialization also leads us to forget that inventing new things to produce tomorrow is as important, if not more so, than increasing what is produced today.

Since the value of genuine innovation can’t be measured, it tends to be discarded in a world focused exclusively on forever increasing such meaningless statistics as GDP and stock market capitalisations with no understanding of why these numbers ought to go up.

We never even think about what they might have been.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The dominant regime of political economy in the West since 1971, and particularly acute since 2009, has been built on a set of related economic fallacies: that there are no adverse consequences to manipulating the price and supply of money; that economic wellbeing can be measured by increases in flows of revenue rather than the growth rate of profit over capital; that such measures as GDP growth and stock market capitalisation ought to be maximised at all costs; and that the growth rate of the average matters, but not the average growth rate.</p><p>Had we built a capitalistic society on the principles of sound money and long-term returns, a great many institutions and incentives would likely be radically different to what we see today. The structure of economic production would be far more robust to shocks, far more inclusive in its creation and distribution of wealth, and far less corrupting in its rewarding of political cronyism.</p><p>That we have not has led to dire consequences that the coronavirus outbreak has exposed and exacerbated, but which existed nonetheless and, given enough time, would have found another way to explode. The factors we falsely deem to cause economic wellbeing are in fact fine-tuned to accelerate our inevitable descent into ever greater fragility, inequality, extraction, and financialization, and, ultimately, to the total depletion of capital.</p><p>This is your brain on central banking, regulatory capture, and financialization. This is not capitalism.</p><p>Thanks to Nic Carter for edits and contributions</p><p>In addition to those cited, thanks to Ben Hunt, Parker Lewis, and Mark Spitznagel, who did not directly contribute, but to whom we owe an intellectual debt</p><p>You can follow Allen on Twitter @allenf32</p><p>Allen has not yet convinced Sacha to create a Twitter account, so you can only follow him on Medium for now.

  <p>The world you know and love is no more, even if it isn’t obvious to
every one of you just yet. We will look back at this moment in time, the
months we are currently living through, the weeks that will mark the
line between the pre-virus and the post-virus world. One thing is clear:
we are past the inflection point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when
decades happen.”</p>

  <p><cite>Vladimir Lenin*</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the events around the COVID-19 pandemic unfold, the fragility of our
global systems becomes painfully obvious. This health crisis is
triggering a financial one, and if we don’t get our act together, things
will go from bad to worse.</p>

The Legacy System is Crumbling

<p>Both our money and our financial system has fundamental issues. Ruled
from the top down by unelected decision-makers, these structures are not
equipped to handle complex problems. Even worse, trying to fix a complex
system by heavily interfering with natural processes will turn an
annoying mosquito problem into a deadly snake problem (with some frogs
in-between).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move
to higher levels.”</p>

  <p><cite>Albert Einstein</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization is efficient until it isn’t. I’m afraid that most of us
are going to learn this lesson the hard way: one by one, central points
of failure will crumble under the pressure of current world events, and
all we can do is watch our fragile legacy systems collapse (or turn into
Orwellian nightmares).</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting that all “old” systems are obsolete — they aren’t.
I’m suggesting that we are transitioning to a post-virus world, and it
will be impossible to understand what is going on — and how problems
might be solved — if you aren’t equipped to understand and use the
tools of this new era.</p>

A New Type of Thinking

<p>The tools of the post-virus world need to be transparent, open, and
freedom-enabling. Gatekeepers, censors, and arbitrary restrictions won’t
help us to solve the problems we are facing — they will only make
things worse. Information wants to be free, and we will need all the
information out in the open to fight the battles yet to come.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you what kind of tools will emerge. Instead, let me list
some things that are both of the utmost importance and difficult to
understand/accept if you come from the legacy world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bitcoin</li>
  <li>the internet</li>
  <li>social media</li>
  <li>citizen journalism</li>
  <li>memes and misinformation</li>
  <li>open-source and free (libre) software</li>
</ul>

<p>Others aren’t as hard to understand, but equally important: encryption,
open hardware, biohacking, DIY biology, 3d printing, and other forms of
distributed manufacturing.</p>

<p>These tools and the new type of thinking that comes along with them will
lead to different structures, a different way of doing things, different
outcomes. It might seem strange and inefficient at times, and that’s
okay. The important part is that we move away from fragile systems and
central points of failure, building robust, and even anti-fragile
systems for generations to come.</p>

Fragile, Robust, and Anti-Fragile Systems

<p>The world is a scary, complicated, and chaotic place. Our
interconnectedness and interdependence have drastic and unforeseen
consequences, as the current pandemic shows so clearly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Someone ate a bat in China and now you don’t get to retire. Funny how
 the world works.”</p>

  <p><cite>Jeremy Ross</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many systems got centralized over time, moving from robustness to
fragility: the global financial system, various supply chains, large
parts of our media apparatus, and even the money we use daily.</p>

<p>Complex, large-scale problems require organic, bottom-up, emergent
solutions. We, as a society, need to make sure that robust solutions can
emerge, which implies that we need to protect personal liberties and
encourage personal responsibility more than ever.</p>

<p>It would be great if a benevolent ruler could step in and solve all our
problems. Unfortunately, every benevolent ruler transforms into a
totalitarian dictator given enough time. And I hope we can all agree
that we don’t need any more of those.</p>

<p>I would love to end on an optimistic note, but the future ahead will be
dark and bumpy, especially if the legacy world is all you know.</p>

  <p>My brother’s hospital ran out of masks this week because patients kept breaking into storage cabinets and stealing them. So now doctors have to supply their own masks, respirators, and other protective gear.</p>
<p>There have been other reports of hospitals getting burglarized for masks. Why would anyone steal from a hospital? Is this what it looks like when you give up on having a functional society?</p>
<p>We take a lot of cooperative behavior for granted. Left to our own devices, humans have the cognitive capacity to form cooperative relationships with about 150 others. Dunbar&#8217;s number. </p>
<p>Stuff like religion and government enable social scalability so people can collaborate outside of their immediate acquaintances. It’s easier to trust strangers if you believe that some greater force exists to exact justice. The force doesn’t have to be real – Roman banks stored silver in weakly-guarded temples – but the belief has to be universal for societal trust to exist. </p>
<p>We can cooperate with strangers as long as we trust the government to maintain order. When times are good, we play nice and what goes around comes around. In times of crisis, trust runs scarce and government entities step in as the confidence-bearer of last resort. </p>
<p>But now we see that the federal government is powerless to do anything but print money. When the only tool you have is debt monetization, every problem looks like a credit crunch. When people lose faith in the government, they show it by turning on each other. </p>

  ♦Coronavirus cases by county, as of March 13.
<p>Here’s how Trump gets reelected: Declare emergency funding for immediate dispersion. By which I mean, pay people to disperse from dense, disease-ridden cities. A decentralized country is an antifragile country.</p>
<p>Yes, cities are more efficient&#8230; Efficient at spreading disease.</p>
<p>After World War II, there was a huge housing shortage as materials and resources had been diverted to the war effort, and people crowded into cities for defense jobs. The government didn’t care about lack of housing or crowded slums, but they did care about the post-war threat of nuclear attack.</p>
<p>In 1950, the National Security Resources Board received $23 billion (the equivalent of $250 billion today) to incentivize industrial dispersion. Defense contracts were awarded contingent on relocating manufacturing facilities to the midwest. </p>
♦The Pittsburgh Press, Jan 21 1949
<p>Trump could be more strategic about it – provide relocation grants to Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio – places where no one wants to live, but which might swing an election. </p>
<p>At this point, there’s no reason to continue living in a dense coastal city. Employers have enacted mandatory work-from-home policies, and if you live in San Francisco your home probably sucks.</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>Here’s a story of how Tulsa, Oklahoma attracted a bunch of remote workers with a $10,000 bribe. It’s like the Zappos Downtown Project, where Tony Hsieh sunk $350 million in an attempt to build an innovation hub in Las Vegas. Attempts to create an urban hub in the desert, or out in the Great Plains, overlooks the one redeeming feature of these places: Cheap land.</p>
<p>Dense cities are out; sprawling homesteads are in! We spend $20 billion per year on agricultural subsidies so that farmers can grow cheap corn for exports to China. Now that we’re closing off trade with China, let’s reclaim the land and disperse the people, Little House On The Prairie-style. </p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>The original Homestead Act granted 160 acres per household – that’s how much land it used to take to feed a family – but today we have GMOs, chemical fertilizers, and Monsanto. You can feed a family of four on only two acres, and still have room for an in-law unit! </p>
<p>I know, I know. We’ve all grown accustomed to the niceties of urban living. Walkability, cultural capital, fortuitous social encounters. Densely-packed nursing homes where we can dump off our elders. Division of labor taken to a ridiculous extreme. </p>
<p>Cities are unnatural. Back in our hunter-gatherer days, humans were about as densely populated as bears. Maybe Darwin will run its course, ravage the cities, and weed out those with an affinity for vibrant arts scenes. When it&#8217;s over, only the antisocial losers will remain.</p>

  ♦<p>Disclaimer: this is not medicinal advice, I’m not a doctor and don’t play one on the internet. This is coming from an enthusiastic mycophile. This is my best understanding of the topic at hand, please reach out if I got anything wrong or if you have anything to add (reach out on twitter or comment below).</p><p>Quick Summary</p><ul><li>Covid-19 is here and it’s a big deal. Prepare yourself.</li><li>Medicinal mushrooms are shown to support the immune system, and show signs of being active against viruses (Covid-19 is a virus)</li><li>Are medicinal mushrooms a silver bullet? Absolutely not.</li><li>Will consuming medicinal mushrooms help to support your immune system? Absolutely. I share my favorite medicinal mushrooms below.</li><li>There is no downside, why not give your body the best chance for success?</li><li>Finally, this article is NOT about psilocybin containing “magic mushrooms”</li></ul>Mushrooms Have Been Used as Medicine for Thousands of Years<p>The bottom line is they are safe to consume and have a long history of being used by humans as medicine. You can eat them daily for the rest of your life without negative consequences.</p><blockquote>Medicinal mushrooms describe a category of edible members of the kingdom Fungi, traditionally associated with health-supporting properties. They have been used for millennia to treat an array of ailments, particularly in traditional Asian medicine and Eastern European traditions. They are well regarded for supporting longevity, treating infectious disease and cancer, and promoting overall well-being [1]</blockquote><p>I’ve personally been taking medicinal mushroom supplements nearly daily for 5+ years. And eating wild foraged mushrooms daily during the 4–5 month season. While I wildcraft the majority of my personal use medicinal mushrooms, I also purchase many products from reputable producers (my recommendations below).</p>Why Mushrooms?♦Chicken of the woods mushroom<p>You can call mushrooms “nutraceuticals” as in natural pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Medicinal mushrooms work because humans and fungi are very similar biologically. I know this sounds weird, but it’s true.</p><p>Fungi and Animals both inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide and we both find our own food (plants make their own food). Taxonomists even proposed a new super-kingdom that combined fungi and animals, called Opisthokont.</p><p>Fungi are constantly in an underground microbiological war against viruses, bacteria, and other fungi. Over time, these fungi have developed molecules to defend themselves against these invaders. Turns out these fungal medicines also work well on humans.</p>Medicinal mushrooms support your immune system and are active against viruses<p>How do we benefit from consuming medicinal mushrooms. Medicinal mushrooms are known to help with many different things. For the purpose of this article, we’re going to focus on the 3 main ways medicinal mushrooms can be helpful during a viral pandemic.</p><p>Benefit #1: Improve Immune System</p><p>Medicinal Mushrooms are considered “adaptogens.”</p><blockquote>Definition: adaptogens are herbs that help to support and balance the body in adapting to emotional, physical, biological, and mental stress.</blockquote><p>In other words, medicinal mushrooms work bi-directionally. If your immune system needs to be turned on, then it gets turned on. If your immune system is hyperactive, then the mushrooms signal to your body to turn off your overactive immune system. Sounds like magic right? Well, it kinda is.</p><blockquote>Herbal immunomodulators work their magic in part through the equilibration of the endocrine and nervous control of the immune system. By balancing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, these tonic herbs help to harmonize the control centers of the body by affecting hormonal regulation of the immune system. Another possible mode of action is the regulation of T helper cell (Th1 and Th2) balance, which involves the equilibrium of cell-mediated (T cells) and antibody-mediated (B cells) immunity. [2]</blockquote><p>Benefit #2: Improve General Wellbeing</p><p>Mushrooms are known to do many non-specific things for the body that are useful when preparing for and fighting an illness.</p><p>Examples include: Improve sleep, improve gut health, and reduce inflammation.</p><p>None of these things are directly related to stopping Covid-19 but they all prepare your body to be as effective as possible against the illness.</p><p>Benefit #3: Some Mushrooms are Active Against Some Viruses</p><p>However this doesn’t mean taking medicinal mushrooms will cure you of Covid-19. In fact, as far as I know, there are no medicinal mushrooms have been shown to defeat Covid-19.</p><p>We know that many mushrooms show high levels of activities against many of our well known viruses. Showing activity against viruses is not the same as “we have a medicine ready to treat X virus.”</p><p>We’re at the limit of modern science here and the answer is we don’t really know how far medicinal mushrooms can go in fighting viruses, but so far the results are extremely promising.</p>What is Active Inside the Mushroom? (Let’s Get Sciency)<p>Feel free to skip this section if you just want to buy your supplements and move on with your day.</p><p>There are two main categories of medicine inside fungi: Beta-glucans and a wide range of secondary metabolites (polyphenols, triterpenes, etc)</p><p>Medicinal properties #1: Beta-glucans</p><p>These are the main thing we’re going after when looking to support your immune system.</p><p>Mushroom polysaccharides (ie: β-glucans) possess documented immuno-modulatory properties, specifically through the activation of natural killer cells, macrophages, and neutrophils, as well as induction of innate immune cytokines and interleukins. [3]</p><p>Beta-glucans are found in various quantities in all the medicinal mushrooms. However the secondary metabolites are unique to each species of fungi — this means if you have a very specific goal in mind, be more selective on your species.</p><p>Medicinal properties #2: Secondary Fungal Metabolites</p><p>These secondary metabolites are low-molecular-weight compounds that fall into a few main categories such as polyphenols and triterpenes.</p><ul><li>Polyphenols have been shown to help with inflammation. [5]</li><li>Triterpenes are also effective at fighting inflammation. [6]</li></ul><p>Then there are a host of specific metabolites like those found in the Lion’s Mane mushroom that are used to stimulate neurogenesis (which has been shown to improve dementia in a Japanese study) — however we won’t get to these today as it’s not related to Covid-19.</p>Mushroom Supplements 101<p>Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, as always you should make your own decisions regarding your health. Some of the products below contain affiliate links which means I may earn a small commission for purchases. Of course this comes at no extra expense to you.</p><p>Ok this section is for the impatient people who scrolled here immediately. I don’t blame you ;) it’s getting weird out there.</p><p>What mushrooms species should I focus on?</p><p>I haven’t heard of any specific species being highly active against Covid-19. Which means I would focus on a wide range of species known to simply support your immune system. Good choices include: Reishi, Chaga, Turkey Tail, Birch Polypore, Shiitake, Maitaki, and Cordyceps</p><p>How do you select high quality medicinal mushrooms?</p><p>First off, do NOT buy random mushroom supplements. The industry is full of bullshit products taking advantage of uneducated customers. Good products are more expensive, no way around it.</p><p>NEVER consume raw mushrooms as humans cannot digest them. You’re paying to poop out the medicine. Instead you want mushrooms that have undergone a dual extraction — this means a hot water extraction and an alcohol extraction. These extraction methods are what make the medicine bioavailable. Cooking with fat also works, but many of the medicinal mushrooms are not useful in culinary endeavors.</p><blockquote>Quick rant on shady mushroom companies… Many companies are selling dehydrated raw mushroom powder which is not digestible by humans — avoid them at all costs. Some medicinal mushrooms (like chaga) are only found in the wild and are currently being over-harvested.</blockquote><blockquote>The companies selling you “raw chaga powder to put in smoothies” should be boycotted. They’re profiting by selling you an over-harvested mushroom supplement that offers no medicinal benefits. Be sure to send these companies an email saying “go fuck yourselves” for taking advantage of your consumers and our environment.</blockquote><p>How to select good mushroom supplements? Look for these:</p><ul><li>Dual extracted (never raw)</li><li>The company lists the % of beta-glucans (20% is a good bench mark)</li><li>Third party testing (COA) available for you to see</li><li>Extracts are made from fruiting body* (though this is nuanced, so a better approach is to ensure they measure beta-glucans and it’s above 20%)</li></ul><p>How often should you take them?</p><p>Medicinal mushrooms are a marathon. For maximize results you want to be taking these 1–2x per day for months. The effects compound over time. Remember there are no known side effects to daily use.</p><p>Before adding supplements, make sure your fundamentals are covered</p><p>If you’re not doing the basics right, it doesn’t matter how many medicinal mushrooms you shove down. These are all mandatory… Good sleep, moderate exercise (avoid at the gym), eliminate sugar/soda, and reduce stress.</p><blockquote>Our emotions play a central role in the functioning of our immune systems — so much so, that there’s a whole field of science called psychoneuroimmunology. Our moods — and sense of connection — have a profound effect on our white blood cells (immune cells, such as B cells, T cells, natural killer [NK] cells, and macrophages). The feelings of stress and social isolation are some of the biggest immune “downers” out there. Stress hormones, such as adrenaline (epinephrine) and cortisol, weaken immune function. Conversely, when we are relaxed and happy, our cells produce neuronal signaling molecules such as serotonin, dopamine, and relaxin, which have a strengthening effect on the immune system. [2]</blockquote>Specific Mushroom Products I use and Recommend<p>Please note: these supplements will likely all be sold out in the coming weeks.</p><p>I personally wildcraft the majority of my own mushroom medicine. However, I also purchase some that I love. Here are a few that will be most helpful to support your immune system during a viral pandemic.</p><ul><li>Real Mushrooms — 5 Defenders capsules [Amazon] — 100 servings. Each capsule contains a dual extraction from the following mushrooms: reishi, chaga, maitake, shiitake and turkey tail mushrooms. I purchased this exact product yesterday.</li></ul><p>Besides medicinal mushrooms, here are some other supplements I recommend taking daily for the next ~2 months minimum.</p><ul><li>Live Wise Naturals — Vitamin D3 + K2 liquid — Vitamin D3 is crucial for many of your body’s functions, including the immune system. If you live near the equator, just go outside for 20–30 minutes per day. If it’s winter or you don’t live near the equator, it’s smart to supplement with vitamin D. I take 2,000–4,000 iu daily every day during winter. No brainer during Covid-19 pandemic.</li><li>Gia Herbs — Astragalus — an herb with a long history of human use, known to be effective against viruses. I will be taking this daily until the pandemic settles down. According to Dr. Andrew Weil, “This is a very well-known medicinal plant. It’s non-toxic and can be used long-term. There’s good research supporting its efficacy against viral infections.” [7]</li><li>Allimax — Allicin — the active ingredient in garlic is known to support your immune system [8]. According to Dr. Andrew Weil, there is a county in China where no one got sick with Covid-19. The hypothesis: the unaffected county is where they grow garlic and all the people here consume lots of garlic. I cannot verify this claim, however allicin is known to support the immune system and IMO it’s a no brainer to add to the stack. I purchased some Allimax branded Allicin and plan to consume daily for the next 30 days.</li></ul>Let’s Flatten the Curve♦eat those shrooms!<p>Take care of yourself and your loved ones. Consume your medicinal mushrooms. Take a few deep breaths. Read a book.</p><p>Connect with me on twitter if you want to discuss any topics here (my DMs are open).</p><p>PS: I also published a series comparing Mushrooms and Mycelium to Bitcoin.

  <p>Thank you so much, Tomas. This is excellent and I have widely shared. I have been trying to raise awareness myself and have sadly concluded that either petitioning or waiting for government is futile. we must take personal responsibility for the virus, particularly for those close to us, who trust us, and who it is possible we can nudge into action. I wrote the post below both to explain this and hopefully to be useful as a tool in this regard.

  <p>take personal responsibility for the virus, particularly for those close to you, who mistake deviations from nonchalance as indistinguishable from panic.</p>♦photo by Jacqueline Macou, via Pixabay<p>Fires happen occasionally, albeit very rarely. They could be said to have a very low ‘mortality rate’ across the population. The aggregate cost of outfitting adequate fire escapes almost certainly exceeds the costs incurred by fires — or ever likely to be incurred — by several orders of magnitude. But, in this realm, we do not weigh up saved lives in economic terms, within reason. Nobody would accuse proponents of fire escapes of inciting panic. Nobody says we should wait and see if we really need them. If proponents insisted every single door in the world be a fire escape, every wall fireproofed, and every employer required to subsidise a fortnight’s training in fire preparedness, then this criticism would probably be merited. But if all they ask is for fire escapes, I doubt many would see a problem. Moreover, during a rapidly spreading fire seems an odd time to start making such a case.</p><p>I should lay my cards on the table: I have been worried about the coronavirus for quite some time. I have no special knowledge of medicine or biology, no less virology. Nor am I generally paranoid, nor even risk-averse; I love a good risk if the payoff profile suits. But I do have an expert, if amateur, interest in what might be called the philosophy of gambling, or — less politely — debunking absurdities in the interpretation of probability and the logic of risk taking.</p><p>The simple fact of having searched out those with a similar academic inclination in the prior years led me to the likes of Joe Norman, Robin Hanson, Harry Crane, Ben Hunt, Balaji Srinivasan, and more. I am not claiming to endorse everything these thinkers have said. But I will happily bang the table in insisting that they were absolutely right about the risks of the virus, were brave in speaking up against a chorus of nonchalant, obnoxious, ignorant nay-sayers, and will one day be seen as having performed an invaluable public service.</p><p>I penned an article to this effect last week to admonish their natural opponents — risk-illiterate public intellectuals — and to encourage my readers to ignore these faux-sophisticated probabilistic fallacies that seemed to serve little other purpose than to shill the intellect of the author and the standing of the publication. I urged the reader instead to remain calm, rigorously analyse the risks for themselves, and take suitable precautions.</p><p>In promoting the article, and generally encouraging greater seriousness and awareness of the risks in various public forums, I believe I have detected a more important fault line that needs to be addressed. Particularly in the United Kingdom, where I live, there has been so much of a media-engendered hysteria over such genuine concerns as panic buying toilet paper and stealing hand sanitiser from hospitals that sensible risk aversion has become a very difficult message to convey. The impression most seem to have is a binary alternative: unrestrained panic or perfect calm. Either everything is fine or everybody is going to die. No doubt this is yet another product of the contemporary journalistic obsession with debate and conflict over complexity and nuance.</p><p>I want to argue that this framing may be even more dangerous than risk-illiteracy or general nonchalance alone. It is drowning out those whose message is the most vital. This piece is an attempt to get that message across.</p><p>We are far past debate about the danger posed by the virus. Italy has shown this. Readers may not be familiar with exactly what is happening there or what the risks are, precisely. The situation is complex and evolving quickly, so I would not want readers to take my word as read. Please do your own research to verify, and stay on top of events. But as far as I can tell, the most potent danger is not the much-discussed issue of the ‘mortality rate’ or the demographic skew, but the fact of health resources becoming completely overwhelmed. Consider the twitter thread the first tweet of which is below. I have no reason to disbelieve this, nor could I possibly imagine why it would be put forward disingenuously:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>From a well respected friend and intensivist/A&amp;amp;E consultant who is currently in northern Italy: 1/ &#39;I feel the pressure to give you a quick personal update about what is happening in Italy, and also give some quick direct advice about what you should do.</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@jasonvanschoor</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>So the questions become: can we expect something similar elsewhere? And, if so, what should we do?</p><p>We almost certainly do not know what to expect elsewhere. It is likely that simple. There are no data from controlled experiments and we should not pretend we have access to such knowledge. But this is exactly why we should be maximally precautious, because we can see, right in front of us, what can happen. And we don’t even know if this is the worst possible case. The only way to find out what could happen in, for example, the UK, is to do nothing and see. Hopefully it is clear to the reader that this is an unacceptable option.</p><p>So what should we do? We should neither panic nor relax. There is an obviously sensible middle ground which I implore readers to consider for themselves, and to try to convince their friends, families, colleagues, and elected representatives to take seriously. As Dr Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said in a remarkable interview on Channel 4 News last Friday,</p><blockquote>“One problem that we face as a society when we have a virus that might have a fatality rate of one percent, and that mortality is concentrated in certain parts of the population — the elderly or the chronically ill — one challenge that we face is that people who are young and generally healthy won’t perceive personal risk and they will govern their behaviour based on what they perceive their personal risk to be. I think we need to start thinking in terms of the social risk.”</blockquote>medium.com/media/8defbe465ec8c67cf07adc68c05f3069/href<p>Some things we almost certainly do know. The Atalanta vs Valencia Champions League match in Milan three weeks ago seems likely to have furthered the spread of the virus all over Europe, and especially with the travelling support back to Spain. This was strongly suspected even two weeks ago, never mind today. The return leg was played yesterday behind closed doors for the obvious reason of discouraging Milanese visitors — this verdict was enacted before the total quarantine of Lombardy made it moot. Three weeks later, Madrid is now the epicentre in Spain, and yet, right now, tens of thousands of Madrilenians are being allowed to congregate in Liverpool. This could easily have been stopped.</p><p>I hope it is clear I am advocating for little more than common sense here. It is important that necessities be available in supermarkets for those who don’t go on a panic shopping spree — especially since it seems obvious that those most vulnerable to the virus are exactly those likely to be left behind in such a rush. But it is not necessary, by any stretch of the imagination, that thousands of strangers from across the continent watch live sports in close quarters. You can watch it on TV. That should be the end of the discussion.</p><p>This nuance is readily applicable to most, if not all, aspects of life. We do not all need to self-isolate immediately, entirely, and for indefinitely long. But a great many people who are not working from home can do so with minimal difficulty. A great many more probably should anyway, despite the inconvenience. Schools are a tricky issue given children do not seem to be vulnerable, and many working parents rely on the 9–5 schedule, but universities are a different matter entirely. It is almost trivial to decide to deliver lectures and assign coursework remotely. Without any guidance, students are likely to be a dynamic vector of spread given their constant back and forth to urban centres, and nauseating levels of contact on campus. I was a student fairly recently. I remember this with only mild and selective fondness and am relieved I am not in a similar position today. I have here recounted only those situations that come to me naturally. Readers will have their own, and I implore them to take their instinctive concerns seriously and think about what they are able to temporarily change.</p><p>Unfortunately, you may need make whatever changes of your own volition, and drive similar change privately. Probably the only part of this discussion that I think does merit relative panic has been the response of governments in Europe and the US. I have honestly never witnessed such dangerous, corrupt incompetence in my life. Leaking details of a quarantine before it goes into effect, prompting a mass exodus of the infected; allowing flights from pandemic regions without even screening arriving passengers; prohibiting widespread testing due to an email server crash; constantly, incessantly lying; I could write an entire article composed solely of links of this kind. As I give this piece its final touches, I read that the UK Health Minister has the virus.</p><p>It is clear to me that government will not help the situation in any meaningful way, or any time soon. Or at least that we should not expect this to happen and should act as if it won’t. I do not say this to panic the reader, but to urge yet more strongly the need for the reader to drive change themselves. Do not wait for interventions from on high. Start a grassroots effort. Educate your friends, petition your employer, pester your colleagues, check in on your elderly neighbours. If they don’t cancel public events, simply refuse to attend. If they don’t let you work from home, take a holiday until they change their minds. If your friends want to go out, just say no. Netflix and chill, and send them this article if you think there is time to influence them. We need widespread and dramatic social distancing. There is no debate on this.</p><p>Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now</p><p>I began with a poker metaphor, and I will finish with one too. Beginners (and risk-illiterate public intellectuals) will often see the flop, turn, and river unfold to their misfortune and exclaim, I should have stayed in! No, they should not have. You judge decisions based on information available at the time, not on information that can only possibly be known after the decision has been made.</p><p>There is likely a niggling fear amongst many on the fence about going public with their concerns. It will look like their pleas to take reasonable precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus were foolish and panicked if and only if they work. I have no remedy for this, I’m afraid. Such is life. But life’s ironic cruelty ought not to be reason to avoid doing the right thing. The cruelty of the virus is infinitely worse than your potential for embarrassment, and the information available is more than enough to start acting. I am reminded of the following passage from Nassim Taleb’s The Black Swan, which, incidentally, it wouldn’t hurt if everybody reread right away,</p><blockquote>“Assume that a legislator with courage, influence, intellect, vision, and perseverance manages to enact a law that goes into universal effect and employment on September 10, 2001; it imposes the continuously locked bulletproof doors in every cockpit (at high costs to the struggling airlines) — just in case terrorists decide to use planes to attack the World Trade Centre in New York City …</blockquote><blockquote>The person who imposed locks on cockpit doors gets no statues in public squares, not so much as a quick mention of his contribution in his obituary. “Joe Smith, who helped avoid the disaster of 9/11, died of complications of liver disease.” Seeing how superfluous his measure was, and how it squandered resources, the public, with great help from airline pilots, might well boot him out of office. He will retire depressed, with a great sense of failure. He will die with the impression of having done nothing useful.”</blockquote><p>This is already worse than 9/11, and it is happening in slow motion, so start locking doors. Do not encourage panic — this is a bad idea regardless. But do strongly discourage nonchalance. Precaution and personal responsibility are what we need. They are what we will need, and they are what we needed all along.</p><p>follow me on Twitter @allenf32</p>♦

  The Coronavirus Black Swan — Part 2Trading Bitcoin in Fear, Greed and Recession♦Take-aways<ul><li>Recessionary risk adds additional stress to low-profitability Bitcoin Miners in 2020</li><li>If the percentage of Bitcoin Miners that are zombies is similar to the that of US listed companies, Hash Rates and Bitcoin’s fair value could fall an additional ~20% during a recession</li><li>The “Amygdala Overdrive Relationship” suggests a high correlation of Bitcoin to equities in times of extreme fear and greed</li><li>Early stages of a recession would likely see Bitcoin fall with global markets, later stages may see a Crisis Adoption event</li><li>$100,000+ Bitcoin target within 5 years</li><li>2020 worst case scenario: $6,400 Bitcoin at Christmas</li></ul>Trading Bitcoin in Fear, Greed and Recession<p>This week has seen a significant Bitcoin retracement, preceding Monday’s biggest daily collapse in the stock market since 2008.</p><p>As outlined in Part I, we are witnessing extreme fear in global markets.</p><p>The Coronavirus has increased the probability of triggering a recession to a tinderbox economy and is sending amygdalas into overdrive globally.</p><p>While Bitcoin is mostly uncorrelated with other markets, it is still traded by emotional humans.</p><p>And when in fear, humans abandon “risky” assets.</p>Halvening + Recession = Big Miner Stress<p>In Part I we noted that 18% of US companies were found to be “zombies” in 2018, surviving paycheck to paycheck with the help of their credit lines. But we don’t know how many leveraged Bitcoin Miners are operating paycheck to paycheck today.</p><p>The Bitcoin Halvening event is already a stressful period for miners as their revenue stream effectively halves, causing low profitability miners to go out of business. Add a recession to the equation and tightening credit lines may put a lot more “zombie” Bitcoin miners out of business in a Credit Crunch type event.</p><p>If we estimate the number of Zombie Miners to be roughly the same as US listed companies, we should not be surprised to see a recession event result in an additional ~20% of Bitcoin Miners going out of Business (give or take a good margin of error here).</p><p>This base case estimate for a Bitcoin Miner Credit Crunch would result in a circa -20% drop in Hash Rates and therefore a -20% drop in Bitcoin’s fair Value (Bitcoin’s Energy Value).</p><p>In December 2019, the non-recessionary forecast for mid-2020 was a worst case Bitcoin Electrical Cost (the historic price floor) of $8,000. However, a recession adds a Bitcoin Miner Credit Crunch risk to the equation, the estimated worst case is now adjusted accordingly to $6,400.</p><p>Without doing a detailed study of Bitcoin miner financials, it is impossible to know how exactly how many are zombie miners there are and what the true risk is here. This estimate should be considered indicative only. The actual drop in Hash Rates and Bitcoin’s valuation due to a Bitcoin Miner Credit Crunch could be considerably higher or lower. We have never seen Bitcoin during a recession, and if it happens, it will be a learning for all.</p>But isn’t Bitcoin a Store of Value?<p>Like it or not, 99% of the world still sees Bitcoin as “risky” and public perception matters.</p><p>The current Coronavirus panic has ignited risk-off actions in your local supermarket, stock market and crypto market.</p><p>The Bitcoin “Store of Value” / “Digital Gold” argument will not be valid until the broader population sees Bitcoin as a better Store of Value than traditional assets. That is certainly not the case yet. Broader trust in Bitcoin in tumultuous times requires greater adoption or greater belief in Bitcoin’s monetary policy.</p><p>How might widespread adoption / belief be achieved?</p><ol><li>With time. Bitcoin has been growing in adoption steadily over the years, and every halving boosts public awareness to Bitcoin’s sound monetary policy. There is no reason to expect this to change with the passage of time and as the technology infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin improves.</li><li>In peak crisis disillusion. When broader populations are in disbelief of their current financial systems and lose faith in legacy banking, we may witness fast-tracked Bitcoin adoption event due to its low inflation sound monetary policy.</li></ol><p>“Crisis Adoption” will likely require global financial markets to be in a much worse position than they are today. A greater destruction of wealth is required to create disillusion and “break the trust” of the people in the current financial system, much like the 2008 crash did before Bitcoin existed.</p><p>If correct, the early stages of a recession will see Bitcoin suffer, and peak recessionary disillusion may offer some of the best risk-reward opportunities in Bitcoin’s history.</p><p>Bitcoin is not a Store of Value until the people see it as a store of value.</p>Bitcoin’s Amygdala Overdrive Relationship<p>In 2020 we have seen just about every case made for potential Bitcoin correlations to traditional assets. With the US-Iran tensions, it was argued Bitcoin was correlated with gold. With the Coronavirus it argued Bitcoin is correlated with Stocks.</p><p>But what is correct?</p><p>To date, neither Gold nor Stocks have shown sustained correlation with Bitcoin.</p>♦Beta of Bitcoin to the S&amp;P over multiple horizons shows only fleeting periods of correlation<p>However, as noted by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, Bitcoin’s best years have coincided with years of strong equity performance:</p><blockquote>“Bitcoin does best when the S&amp;P is up more than 15%”</blockquote><p>This suggests that when the market is “risk-on”, investors seek returns from both stocks and Bitcoin.</p><p>Recently, we have also seen Bitcoin correct in near lockstep with the equities markets during a period of extreme Coronavirus driven panic.</p>♦Feb/Mar 2020 Bitcoin and S&amp;P collapse — correlation during times of extreme fear<p>This brings us to the following “Amygdala Overdrive Relationship”:</p><blockquote>Bitcoin’s correlation to traditional markets today only exists at the extremities in fear and greed. Precisely at the times when primal human emotions take over.</blockquote><p>That is:</p><ol><li>When markets are in Extreme Greed: investors are attracted to risky assets and Bitcoin performance correlates with equities</li><li>When markets are in Extreme Fear: investors dump risky assets and Bitcoin performance correlates with equities</li></ol><p>A comparison of Bitcoin’s price over the last 3 years against extremes in the CNN Fear and Greed Index demonstrates a case for this hypothesis. Note that the periods highlighted also have similar corresponding rallies and corrections in the S&amp;P500.</p>♦Traditional Market Extreme Greed (80+) and Extreme Fear (20-) appears to exhibit a strong correlation with BitcoinStrong Bitcoin Fundamentals<p>Outside of the broader macroeconomic environment, all Bitcoin specific fundamentals currently look fantastic:</p><ul><li>Bitcoin’s Energy Value, a measure for its fair value, is currently 50% above Bitcoin’s price and increasing. Miners are currently committing to the network at the highest rate in Bitcoin’s history.</li><li>Bitcoin is currently trading at its Production Cost suggesting a good value opportunity</li><li>Bitcoin’s Supply growth rate is set to halve on 11 May, making it on par with Gold as the lowest inflationary assets known to man.</li><li>Bitcoin currently has the highest level of global government support in its history. Germany, South Korea and India recently legalized trading, thereby effectively adding an additional 20% of world’s population to Bitcoin’s addressable market.</li></ul><p>It is hard to find a negative when looking at pure Bitcoin fundamentals today. All metrics scream undervaluation.</p>♦Bitcoin’s Energy Value, a fair value measure for Bitcoin, is currently around $12.5KWhat does this all mean for Bitcoin?<p>Long-term (12 — 24 months+)</p><p>Bitcoin’s outlook remains excellent. Extremely strong fundamentals and a potential recessionary “Crisis Adoption” event should be good for Bitcoin.</p><ul><li>Current target: $100K+ within 5 years</li></ul><p>Medium-Term (mid — late 2020)</p><p>The halvening will double Bitcoin’s Production Cost (currently $7900).</p><p>But we now have the real risk of recession. If the Amygdala Overdrive Relationship holds, Bitcoin will draw down with equity markets during the early stages of a recession, until a potential “Crisis Adoption” event is triggered. A recession also adds the possibility of a Miner Credit Crunch and wipe out of Zombie Miners.</p><p>Should Coronavirus fear and recessionary risk subside between now and mid-late 2020, the original December 2019 forecast comes back into play.</p><ul><li>Current target (No-Recession): $8,000 — $17,800</li><li>Current target (Recession): $6,400 — $17,800</li></ul>Conclusion<p>The Coronavirus-triggered recession risk has added an unknown to the equation. We have never seen Bitcoin in an recessionary environment.</p><p>Bitcoin shows evidence of correlation to equities markets in cases of extremities in fear and greed, suggesting the “Amygdala Overdrive Relationship” could initially pull Bitcoin down in a recession. The CNN Fear and Greed Index has been identified as one way of tracking this.</p><p>In the medium-term, we can expect more volatility than would otherwise have been the case without this heightened macroeconomic risk. In times of extreme fear and greed, look to the stock market as an indicator for Bitcoin.</p><p>In the Long-term, the picture remains the same — excellent. In fact, the long-term Bitcoin value proposition may be stronger now due to the increased chance of recession, which could result in a Crisis Adoption event.</p>♦<p>The Coronavirus Black Swan — Part 2 was originally published in Capriole on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Part 1 — The Current Macroeconomic State</p>♦Global markets are dancing a fragile line.<p>The S&amp;P500 has collapsed -19% in just over two weeks, entering correction territory and possibly the start of a bear market. Based on the Recession Watch indicator, there is approximately a 50% chance of a recession within the next year.</p><p>Before the Coronavirus even hit, we were already in the late stages of a Bull market.</p><p>So where are we at now?</p>♦The CNN Fear &amp; Greed Index suggests widespread panic (9 March 2020)All the pieces are in place for a potential recession<p>Global economies today have all the ingredients necessary to spawn a recession, all that is required is the trigger.</p><p>The key economic factors present today, which precede recessions, include:</p><ul><li>The yield curve inversion</li><li>Bottoming unemployment rates</li><li>Assets are extremely overvalued</li><li>Flatlined corporate profits</li><li>Breakout in the gold-to-stocks ratio</li><li>The Trigger: The Coronavirus Black Swan</li></ul><p>Let’s dive into each of these factors.</p><p>Forgot about the Yield Curve inversion?</p><p>In the last 50 years, every time the US treasury yield curve inverted a recession followed within 3 years. On average the S&amp;P500 gained 19.1% following the inversion and peaked 13 months later.</p><p>The last inversion was 7 months ago and the S&amp;P since rose +16% to all-time highs. While it may seem like this inversion is in the past, the current market behavior following the inversion is the perfect example of historic topping processes which preceded prior recessions.</p>♦The Yield Curve as a recessionary predictor. Yield Curve inversions (red dots) precede US recessions (gray)<p>Unemployment rate at a tipping point</p><p>US unemployment is at its lowest level in over 60 years. But isn’t that good?</p><p>Not really.</p><p>It means the economy is at maximum capacity. Low unemployment rates are typical at the back end of bull markets.</p><p>Historically, record low unemployment rates don’t last long, and form sharp V-bottoms. As soon as unemployment ticks up, a recession followed 10 out of 10 times in the last 70 years.</p><p>The Coronavirus could be the trigger of that bottoming process.</p>♦US unemployment rate bottoms and prior Recessions<p>Assets are extremely overvalued</p><p>The Shiller PE ratio, a metric for the relative valuation of the stock market, is also showing signs of topping, similar to previous recessions. A month ago, the Shiller PE was in the top 5% of historic levels for the last 140 years.</p><p>This suggests asset prices are at the upper bounds of historic valuations. It may be a good time to consider the phase:</p><p>“Buy low, sell high”.</p>♦Shiller PE for S&amp;P500<p>Flatlined corporate profits</p><p>US Corporate profits haven’t grown in almost a decade.</p><p>Low interest rate environments have created masses of zombie companies, businesses which can only survive due to easy access to credit, but which do not add economic substance to the economy.</p><p>In 2018, 16% of US companies were found to be zombies, just able to cover their debt obligations.</p><p>In a world of no-fear and inflating asset prices, it is easy for these businesses to be cover their costs and just survive. But as soon as fear kicks in, risk appetites fall, credit tightens and many of these businesses may find they struggle to get financing.</p>♦US Corporate Profits flat for 8 years<p>The Gold-to-Stocks red flag</p><p>The Gold-to-Stocks ratio just broke above the 200-week moving average. The last time this occurred was in 2001, and for more than a decade investors who ditched stocks and just held gold, achieved a higher rate of return.</p><p>The Trigger — The Coronavirus Black Swan</p><p>The economic threat of the Coronavirus is not whether or not the virus will have a serious health impacts, but whether or not people think it will.</p><p>If people are scared of the coronavirus and take actions to minimize social contact with others for extended periods, then corporations earn less, redundancies follow, unemployment rises and recession results.</p><p>Fear driven actions such as cancelling holidays, cancelling concerts, avoiding restaurants and bars, and (at a more extreme level) quarantining entire countries, causes consumers to spend less. Impacts on production and airline demand have already caused flares in the oil market.</p><p>The fact that unemployment is a near record lows means such a process can happen quickly. Add to that the fact that many bussinesses are just ticking along (the zombies) and the cascade effect resulting from sustained “social contact fear” could be swift.</p><p>It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.</p>♦Supermarkets emptying globally, photo courtesy of BBC NewsIt’s not all doom and gloom<p>While all the ingredients for a potential recession are in place, extremities in markets can exist for long periods of time.</p><p>The Coronavirus may be the straw that breaks the camels back, but there is potential that the current market hysteria is short lived.</p><p>Infection cases in China have plateaued over the last month at around 80,000.</p><p>Assuming the growth rate continues to fall in China and then abroad, global fear and panic may peak (or have already peaked) over the coming weeks and months. Fear levels could subside just in time for markets to recover and not experience significant economic impact.</p><p>However, if the Coronavirus fear continues or worsens over the coming 2-3 months, it will likely be too late to control the economic flow on effects that such an environment creates.</p>♦Growth in Coronavirus Cases in China has slowed (Johns Hopkins University)<p>A combination of reduced fear plus potentially large rate cuts and other government easing actions might just result in a fast recovery if they happen very soon.</p>A simple strategy<p>Given the risk factors today, it may pay to have a reduced exposure to equities (sell the bounces) until markets breakout above current all-time highs.</p><p>A strong breakout above current all-time highs would signal a continuing rally. It would also likely mean that Coronavirus fear has subsided, and fresh lows in interest rates and QE may enable the equity bubble to keep growing for a little while longer. Exiting equities now, you would miss a +15% upside if the market rallies from here to the current all-time highs.</p><p>However, if you exit equities now and a recession follows through (let’s assume an average -40% drop from in the S&amp;P highs for arguments sake), you will avoid the destruction of approximately 30% of your wealth, and have the opportunity to buy back into cheap stocks.</p><p>Consider the following simple equities-or-cash strategy.</p><p>Given it is roughly a coin-toss that a recession occurs within the next year, if you exit equities now and re-buy an all-time highs breakout or following a -40% market collapse, you have an expected outcome of increasing your equity holdings by +7.5% (-0.15*0.5 + 0.3*0.5). This assumes that a “no-recession” outcome results in the market rallying to previous all-time highs.</p>Outlook<p>We already had all the ingredients for an economic implosion. The overextended economy is the fuel, the Coronavirus is just the match.</p><p>If the Coronavirus driven fear subsides soon, we may just avoid a recession. <br>If it prolongs for the coming months, the likelyhood of recession increases signficantly.</p><p>In the near-term, expect a lot of volatility.</p><p>Governments and banks will try to support the economy and prevent a potential recession should the virus fear continue. There will be days of positive news and negative news, rate-cuts and stimulus programs. When the recession plays out, there will be “dead-cat bounces” all the way down.</p><p>Equity investors would be wise to tread carefully. Dips today may not yet be for buying. The simple strategy outlined above may help you to better manage your equity risk exposure.</p>♦<p>The Coronavirus Black Swan was originally published in Capriole on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  ♦By Beautyon on The Capital<p>Bitcoin is a very new technology, even though the concept that it brings to life is decades old. The double spending problem has been solved; this means that it is possible to use a digital certificate to stand in the place of money and be sure that no one else can spend that certificate other than you as long as you hold it. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift, the implications of which are not yet fully understood, and for which the tools do not yet exist to fully take advantage of this new idea.</p><p>This new technology requires some new thinking when it comes to developing businesses that are built upon it. In the same way that the pioneer providers of email did not correctly understand the service they were selling for many years, new and correct thinking about Bitcoin is needed and will emerge, so that it reaches its full potential and becomes ubiquitous.</p>♦The original Hotmail Interface<p>Hotmail used familiar technologies (the browser, email) to create a better way of accessing and delivering email; the idea of using an email client like Outlook Express has been superseded by web interfaces and email ‘in the cloud’ that provides many advantages over a dedicated client with your mail in your own local storage.</p><p>Bitcoin, which will transform the way you transfer money, needs to be understood on its own terms, and not just as an online form of money. Thinking about Bitcoin as money is as absurd as thinking about email as another form of sending letters by post; one not only replaces the other but it profoundly changes the way people send and consume messages. It is not a simple substitution or one-dimensional improvement of an existing idea or service.</p><p>As I have explained previously, Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is a protocol. If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can start the process of putting Bitcoin in a proper context, allowing you to make rational suggestions about the sort of services that might be profitable based on it.</p>♦Every part of Bitcoin is text. It is always text, and never at any point ceases to be text. This is a fact, and as text, it is protected under the free speech provisions of the constitutions of civilised nations with guaranteed, irrevocable rights.<p>If Bitcoin is a protocol and not money, then setting up currency exchanges that mimic real world money, stock and commodity exchanges to trade in it is not the sole means of discovering its price. You would not set up an email exchange to discover the value of email services, and the same thing applies to Bitcoin.</p><p>Staying with this train of thought, when you type in an email on your Gmail account, you are inputting your ‘letter’. You press send, it goes through your ISP, over the internets, into the ISP of your recipient and then it is outputted on your recipient’s machine. The same is true of Bitcoin; you input money on one end through a service and then send the Bitcoin to your recipient, without an intermediary to handle the transfer. Once Bitcoin does its job of moving your value across the globe to its recipient it needs to be ‘read out’, i.e. turned back into money, in the same way that your letter is displayed to its recipient in an email.</p><p>In the email scenario, once the transfer happens and the email you have received conveys its information to you, it has no use other than to be a record of the information that was sent (accounting), and you archive that information. Bitcoin does this accounting on the block chain for you, and a good service built on it will store extended transaction details for you locally, but what you need to have as the recipient of Bitcoin is services or goods not Bitcoin itself.</p><p>Bitcoin’s true nature is as an instant way to pay (despite not being money) anywhere in the world. It is not an investment, and holding on to it in the hopes that it will become valuable is like holding on to an email or a PDF in the hopes it will be come valuable in the future; it doesn’t make any sense.Of course, you can hold on to Bitcoin and watch its value go up, and its value willgo up, but you need to have guts to weather the violent waves of selling and buying as the transition to an all Bitcoin economy gets under way. Remember also, that businesses that have a need to store Bitcoin need to be concerned about its value if their models are open ended and are exposed to the market. “Closed Circuit Bitcoin” models have control over everything and never need to worry about prices at exchanges. They can do all their business moving an unlimited amount of fiat with just a few Bitcoin.</p><p>Despite the fact that you can’t double spend them and each one is unique, Bitcoins have no inherent value, unlike a book or any physical object. They cannot appreciate in value. Mistaken thinking about Bitcoin has spread because it behaves like money, due to the fact it cannot be double spent.Misrepresentation of Bitcoin’s true nature has masked Bitcoin’s dual nature of being digital and not double spendable.</p>♦Razzles. They start as a candy, and then end as a gum. Before you chew them, which are they? A candy, or a gum?<p>Bitcoin is digital, with all the qualities of information that make information non scarce. It sits in a new place that oscillates between the goods of the physical world and the infinitely abundant digital world of information, belonging exclusively to the digital world but having the characteristics of both. This is why it has been widely misunderstood and why a new approach is needed to design businesses around it.</p><p>All of this goes some way to explain why the price of buying Bitcoins at the exchanges doesn’t matter for the consumer. If the cost of buying a Bitcoin goes to 1¢ This doesn’t change the amount of money that comes out at the other end of a transfer. As long as you redeem your Bitcoin immediately after the transfer into either goods or currency, the same value comes out at the other end no matter what you paid for the Bitcoin when you started the process.</p><p>Think about it this way. Let us suppose that you want to send a long text file to another person. You can either send it as it is, or you can compress it with zip. The size of a document file when it is zipped can be up to 87% smaller than the original. When we transpose this idea to Bitcoin, the compression ratio is the price of Bitcoin at an exchange. If a Bitcoin is $100, and you want to buy something from someone in India for $100 you need to buy 1 Bitcoin to get that $100 to India. If the price of Bitcoin is 1¢ then you need 10,000 Bitcoin to send $100 dollars to India. These would be expressed as compression ratios of 1:1 and 10,000:1 respectively.</p><p>The same $100 value is sent to India, whether you use 10,000 or 1 Bitcoin.The price of Bitcoins is irrelevant to the value that is being transmitted, in the same way that zip files do not ‘care’ what is inside them; Bitcoin and zip are dumb protocols that do a job. As long as the value of Bitcoins does not go to zero, it will have the same utility as if the value were very ‘high’.</p><p>Bearing all of this in mind, it’s clear that new services to facilitate the rapid, frictionless conversion into and out of Bitcoin are needed to allow it to function in a manner that is true to its nature.</p><p>The current business models of exchanges are not addressing Bitcoin’s nature correctly. They are using the Twentieth Century model of stock, commodity and currency exchanges and superimposing this onto Bitcoin. Interfacing with these exchanges is non-trivial, and for the ordinary user a daunting prospect. In some cases, you have to wait up to seven days to receive a transfer of your fiat currency after it has been cashed out of your account from Bitcoins. Whilst this is not a fault of the exchanges, it represents a very real impediment to Bitcoin acting in its nature and providing its complete value.</p><p>Imagine this; you receive an email from across the world, and are notified of the fact by being displayed the subject line in your browser. You then apply to your ISP to have this email delivered to you, and you have to wait seven days for it to arrive in your physical mail box.</p>♦<p>The very idea is completely absurd, and yet, this is exactly what is happening with Bitcoin, for no technical reason whatsoever.</p><p>It is clear that there needs to be a re-think of the services that are growing around Bitcoin, along with a re-think of what the true nature of Bitcoin is. Rethinking services is a normal part of entrepreneurialism and we should expect business models to fail and early entrants to fall by the wayside as the ceaseless iterations and pivoting progress.</p><p>Bearing all of this in mind, focusing on the price of Bitcoin at exchanges using a business model that is inappropriate for this new software simply is not rational; its like putting a methane breathing canary in a mine full of oxygen breathing humans as a detector. The bird dies even though nothing is wrong with the air; the miners rush to evacuate, leaving the exposed gold seams behind, thinking that they are all about to be wiped out, when all is actually fine.</p>♦Day traders speculating on Bitcoin from home cause the price to oscillate. Its an artificial signal that has nothing to do with demand for Bitcoin and its circulation as an economic tool to facilitate commerce.<p>Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it are here to stay. As the number of people downloading the client and using it increases, like Hotmail, it will eventually reach critical mass and then spread exponentially through the internet. When that happens, the correct business models will spontaneously emerge, as they will become obvious, in the same way that Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook, cellular phones and instant messaging seem like second nature.</p><p>In the future. I imagine that very few people will speculate on the value of Bitcoin, because even though that might be possible, and even profitable, there will be more money to be made in providing easy to use Bitcoin services that take full advantages of what Bitcoin is.</p><p>One thing is for sure; speed will be of the essence in any future Bitcoin business model. The startups that provide instant satisfaction on both ends of the transaction are the ones that are going to succeed. Even though the volatility of the price of Bitcoin is bound to stabilise, since it has no use in and of itself, getting back to money or goods instantly will be a sought after characteristic of any business built on Bitcoin.</p><p>The needs of Bitcoin businesses provide many challenges in terms of performance, security and new thinking. Out of these challenges will come new practices and software that we can only just imagine as they come over the horizon.</p><p>Finally, when there is no more fiat, and the chaotic transition zone between fiat and Bitcoin has been abolished, then everything will be priced in Bitcoin, and there will be no volatility, because no one uses anything other than Bitcoin to buy or sell. If you know any chemistry, this will be like a reaction’s reagents reaching equilibrium; you can shake it and stir it all you like; the reaction is over, and you’re left with the inert product. Right now, compared to the amount of fiat in the world, Bitcoin can expand and contract very rapidly over a large range, because it is small in volume. It can expand to what for many is an unimaginably high price, and then shrink down again. As it gets bigger and accumulates more mass (its price expressed in fiat), these fluctuations will become smaller and smaller. Through all of this, Bitcoin remains exactly the same; it is its users that are publishing numbers as a signal to react upon.</p><p>If you like the content and feel so obliged to send some love via BTC donations you can do so at the address below:↴</p>♦<p>The Capital</p>medium.com/media/3b6b127891c5c8711ad105e61d6cc81f/href♦<p>You don’t care about, “The Price of the Internet” so ignore the price of Bitcoin was originally published in The Capital on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  ♦Photo by Alex Shutin on UnsplashNot only is this okay for Bitcoin, but it’s desirable<p>Inspired by the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute crash course, the following is the Knox index of the best work towards the principled and ethical financialization of the Bitcoin communications protocol. While I have argued that Bitcoin itself should not be defined legally within financial frameworks, its scarce information space has nonetheless accrued subjective value. It is thus primed for financialization on top of the base protocol. Aside from a few pieces that position Bitcoin against its aspiring usurpers, this list is Bitcoin-only. We will share more on that later.</p>Native opportunities<p>Bitcoin is, first and foremost, a distributed communications protocol. This opens it up to some novel native opportunities that would traditionally require third-party intermediaries and auditors:</p><p>It’s the settlement assurances, stupid by Nic Carter is a tour de force that builds on his previous work (here and here) to make the case that the Bitcoin network dominates at enforcing final settlement.</p>♦Source: It’s the settlement assurances, stupid by Nic Carter<p>Making Bitcoin Exchanges Transparent by Christian Decker, James Guthrie, Jochen Seidel and Roger Wattenhofer is a 2015 research paper that, amongst other things, lays out the why and how for Bitcoin custodians to provide proof-of-reserves. There is also a good outline by Blockstream, Standardizing Bitcoin Proof of Reserves, which describes the tools being developed to provide these assurances.</p><p>Bitcoin vaults with anti-theft recovery/clawback mechanisms by Bryan Bishop is a proposal sent to the bitcoin-dev mailing list that outlines how it is possible to hold UTXOs in a self-custodied “vault” that only allows very specific transactions, even allowing the user to effectively undo a transaction.</p>Open data value modelling<p>Bitcoin’s unprecedented open data-set has allowed for the proposal of novel value modelling methodologies:</p><p>Modeling Bitcoin’s Value with Scarcity by PlanB models an idea proposed by Saifedean Ammous in The Bitcoin Standard. The value and soundness of a money can be derived from its stock-to-flow ratio (the amount of new supply coming onto the market as a fraction of the pre-existing supply). The model has surprised many with its fit to price data and prompted a lot of debate about the efficiency of markets and whether Bitcoin’s halving cycles are priced in.</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>So I think May 2020 #bitcoin halving will produce similar results (red dots) as 2012 and 2016 halving.

The series explores how to calculate an individual Node Accrual Rate (NAR) and implores participants to share this data such that a Lightning Network Reference Rate (LNRR) can be derived. As Nik says, the LNRR could “pave the way for a world of relative value calculations and be instrumental in the pricing of off-chain bitcoin lending.”</p><p>Experiments on Cumulative Destruction by Willy Woo is an exploration in using Bitcoin Days Destroyed to derive the value of the Bitcoin network.

<p>A reader points out that the Axis powers suffered an oil embargo during WWII, forcing Japan and Italy to develop fuel-efficient vehicles. (Meanwhile, the Nazis figured out synthetic fuel.) The technologies that enable fuel efficiency lend well to high performance race bikes and sports cars, where power-to-weight ratio determines cornering speed. Hence the overrepresentation of Axis powers on Superbike and F1 podiums.</p>

<p>On the other hand, NASCAR has long been dominated by US auto manufacturers, with Chevy, Ford, and Dodge racking up the most historical wins. See, American engineers can build fine cars if they put their minds to it! Lol just kidding: NASCAR members banned foreign vehicles from participation to avoid competing with superior cars. Toyota was finally allowed to race in 2004, after complaining that all the “American” cars were made in Mexico anyway.</p>

  <p>As I have argued previously, Bitcoin is a living organism. But
where does this organism live, exactly? As with many questions in the world of
Bitcoin, exact answers are hard to come by. Living things have fuzzy edges:
beginnings and endings are hard to pin-point, differentiation is more-or-less
arbitrary, and what was classified as a wolf today might evolve to be a dog
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has no rigid specification, no absolute finality, no fixed development
team, no final security guarantees, no scheduled updates, no central brain, no
central vision, no kings, and no rulers. It is a decentralized organism,
organically evolving without central planners. The lack of any centralization is
the source of Bitcoin’s beauty, it’s organic behavior, and it’s resilience.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is everywhere and nowhere, which makes
figuring out where this thing lives a daunting task. However, it turns out that
there is a space it lives in. Multiple spaces, as we shall see.</p>

The Habitats of Bitcoin

<p>While classifying the habitat of a decentralized organism isn’t trivial, we can
look at the constituents of Bitcoin to make the task a bit easier. As outlined
in the last article of this series, Bitcoin lives across
domains, with one foot in the purely informational realm (ideas and code) and
one foot in the physical realm (people and nodes).</p>



  ♦




<p>An awareness of Bitcoin’s environment(s) might help to better understand this
new form of life. No organism can be meaningfully studied in isolation, and
Bitcoin is no exception. As Alan Watts pointed out, one has to be aware of the
basic unity every organism forms with its environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For the ecologist, the biologist, and the physicist know (but seldom
feel) that every organism constitutes a single field of behavior, or
process, with its environment. There is no way of separating what any
given organism is doing from what its environment is doing, for which
reason ecologists speak not of organisms in environments but of
organism-environments.”</p>

  <p><cite>Alan Watts</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at the organism-environment(s) we
are dealing with. As outlined above, Bitcoin’s ideas and code inhabit one realm,
and Bitcoin’s people and nodes inhabit another. To stick with tradition, let’s
call the physical realm “meatspace” and the purely informational realm
“cyberspace” — even if, as always, the lines might be fuzzy around the
edges.</p>

<p>The “soul” of Bitcoin, so to speak, lives in cyberspace. There, Bitcoin
absorbs useful ideas and incorporates them into its code. As with all living
things, something is useful if it helps an organism to survive. While Bitcoin
has various self-regulatory mechanisms to react to the environment, new ideas
may be necessary for survival if changes are drastic enough.</p>

<p>The “body” of Bitcoin, like all bodies, is living in meatspace. Nodes, hard
drives, cables, and other things come together in an intricate dance, pushing
around electrons, changing zeros to ones and vice-versa, making sure that
Bitcoin’s heart beats about a thousand times a week.</p>

<p>Living things have an interest in staying alive, and the Bitcoin organism is no
exception. Bitcoin found an ingenious way to ensure that it stays alive: it pays
people, as Ralph Merkle pointed out. People — and increasingly, organizations
— are incentivized to keep it alive. They shape the physical world to
Bitcoin’s liking, feed it energy, renew its hardware, and update its software to
keep it alive.</p>

<p>The fact that Bitcoin pays us to keep it alive opens up a third space: a space
of financial transactions, value, and mutual beneficial exchange. Let’s call
this space “finspace.”</p>

<p>To understand finspace, we will have to examine the other side of this coin. So
far, we only examined the side with an uppercase B: the Bitcoin network. But
there is also bitcoin — with a lowercase b — which is the unit of value
itself, brought into existence by every copy of the ledger.</p>

<p>These bitcoins, while deeply embedded in the amber of the ledger, are traded
worldwide on various markets and marketplaces. And since these bitcoins — and
their value — are critical for Bitcoin’s survival, we will have to recognize
finspace as the third space this strange beast lives in. Note that finspace,
strangely enough, is solely inhabited by bitcoin with a lowercase b.</p>

<p>In total, we can identify three distinct environments which the Bitcoin organism
inhabits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cyberspace: the world of ideas and code.</li>
  <li>Meatspace: the world of people and nodes.</li>
  <li>Finspace: the world of value and markets; the world of dollars and sats.</li>
</ul>



  ♦




<p>Understanding these habitats becomes increasingly important, especially as the
climate in one — or more — heats up.</p>

The Climates They Are A-Changin’

<p>The three spaces outlined above — cyberspace, meatspace, and finspace — have
different restrictions; different climates, so to speak. In short: they operate
under different rules. Once these rules change drastically enough, people will
say that “the political climate is heating up” and reports on “the coming
financial climate” will be written. Citizens will be unable to speak and act
freely. If things change drastically enough, people will rise up in protest, or,
if all else fails, flee.</p>

<p>Cyberspace: While we don’t have precise words for it, it is obvious
that the climate in cyberspace has changed quite drastically in the last
two decades or so. The idealistic, utopian ideas which were the
foundation of most of the internet were perverted by the
advertisement-driven surveillance companies which are the giants of
today.</p>

<p>People and politicians are slowly waking up to the strange reality we are living
in: the fact that Facebook can manipulate moods and sway elections is as
disturbing as the fact that Google knows you better than you know yourself.
Edward Snowden showed that the most paranoid netizens were right all along:
everyone in cyberspace is under constant surveillance, without suspicion, by
default.</p>

<p>While the western world does not immediately feel the repercussions
that come with living in a constant state of surveillance, Chinese
citizens are gathering first-hand experience with each passing day.</p>

<p>In the western world, the consequences are advertisements which range from
annoying to spooky. In China, the consequences are frozen bank accounts, an
inability to buy train or plane tickets, elimination of creditworthiness,
automated fines for trivial offenses, and more. Voicing the “wrong” opinion —
online or not — can lead to restricted access to schools, hotels, and jobs.
And after ruining your life with the flip of a bit you will be publicly named as
a bad citizen and the government will take away your dog. If that doesn’t
sound dystopian enough for your taste I bet that it will be in a couple of
years. Remind yourself that this is only the beginning.</p>

<p>In the “free” world, things are more subtle. Multiple efforts are underway to
curb net neutrality, the very cornerstone of the internet. Legislation is being
passed which is inherently incompatible with the laws of cyberspace. It seems
like the last battle of the Crypto
Wars is yet to be fought as
politicians are calling for “responsible encryption” and the ban of certain CAD
files.
Companies are in charge of the speaker’s corners of cyberspace and are making
arbitrary decisions on what can be uttered by whom and what is off-limits.</p>

<p>Bitcoin knows no borders, no jurisdictions. However, it has to conform
to the laws of cyberspace — and if these laws change, e.g. if large
parts of the world block Bitcoin traffic and/or the usage of TOR, the
Bitcoin organism will have to adapt.</p>

<p>Meatspace: Meatspace climate differs wildly from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. Some bastions of freedom still exist, but once you try to
board an international flight it becomes obvious that your right to
privacy and your freedom to bring a bottle of water with you are null
and void.</p>

<p>Protests across the globe indicate that the powerless are fed up with
the powerful, who do everything they can to stay in control and solidify
their positions of influence.</p>

<p>History shows that governments do not shy away from using their power. In 1933,
Executive Order 6102 was
signed, effectively forcing the whole population of the United States to hand
over their gold and gold certificates to the government.</p>



  ♦




<p>Yes, seizing bitcoin is way harder than seizing gold — in some cases
even impossible. But it would surprise me if those who currently control
our money — the governments and central banks of this world — would
simply roll over and let Bitcoin march on unhindered. Governments have a
monopoly on violence, and they are able and willing to abuse this
violence in their own interest.</p>

<p>With Bitcoin, however, people can flee a country with their wealth
intact. While this is definitely not easy, and not something I would
wish on anyone, it is now possible.</p>

<p>Finspace: Where should I even begin? The current, debt-based
financial system has an appetite for printing money which is beyond
belief. Quantitative Easing (QE), Negative Interest Rate Policies
(NIRPs), currency wars, hyperinflations, and a looming recession are
just a few of the recipes of the global instability soup which is
currently brewing.</p>

<p>The current financial system seems so far removed from common sense and
reality, that all the jargon in the world won’t be able to stabilize
this house of cards. People know that our money is broken, which is why
they flee to buying real estate, stocks, and all kinds of complicated
financial constructs to preserve their wealth. In the current system,
you have to be an investment expert just to hold your value.</p>

<p>And we haven’t even talked about the looming recession, and the virtual
inevitability of the next financial crisis yet. Yes, governments might
be able to kick the can down the road by printing ever more money. But
no road is endless, and the experiment which is fiat
money will come to an end, one way or the
other.</p>

<p>How bitcoin will react to a catastrophe in finspace is anyone’s guess.
Some people might flee from their failing fiat currency into bitcoin,
using it as a risk-off asset. Others might sell bitcoin to buy something
they consider more stable, such as real estate or land. A rising number
of people will identify bitcoin as the best money we ever had, shunning
other assets and other monies on the quest to stack as many sats as they
can.</p>

<p>However it might play out, Bitcoin is the cure for many of the current
system’s ills. It is hard money which doesn’t devalue over time. It is
an incorruptible system which forms the basis of a new financial
reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It can’t be changed. It can’t be argued with. It can’t be tampered
with. It can’t be corrupted. It can’t be stopped. It can’t even be
interrupted.”</p>

  <p><cite>Ralph Merkle</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the above, it seems to have many indirect effects. It
lowers the time preference of those who use it. It incentives users to
have better personal and operational security. It incentives individuals
and companies to have better digital hygiene. It propels the development
of chip manufacturing and encryption technology.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin definitely influences its environments and vice-versa, how
Bitcoin reacts to drastic changes is yet to be seen.</p>

Migration

<p>Bitcoin lives on the internet, as Ralph Merkle points out. The internet,
however, is not a necessary requirement for Bitcoin to work. Bitcoin is
text
— pure information — and every system capable of transmitting (and
storing) information is a potential habitat for the Bitcoin organism.
The internet just happens to be the most suitable habitat which
currently exists, since it is the most efficient system to transmit
information we have to date.</p>

<p>Cyberspace: The Bitcoin organism could migrate to other
environments, and multiple efforts are underway which enable Bitcoin to spread
to places where access to Internet infrastructure is limited or non-existent. As
of this writing, Bitcoin transactions (and LN invoices) have been sent via
radio waves, mesh, and satellite networks — just to name a few. All
of these can be seen as Bitcoin conservation efforts, so to speak.</p>

<p>Whether we will see the migration of Bitcoin to another system in the
decades and centuries to come depends, in essence, on whether the
internet will remain a suitable habitat or not. If the online climate
changes drastically enough, we might see the migration to even more
resilient, less restrictive environments.</p>

<p>Meatspace: We can already see that mining facilities pop up where
energy is cheapest or even stranded. In essence, mining is done where it
makes the most sense — economically speaking. The same is true for
running nodes. If people can run nodes at low risk and near zero
marginal cost, they will. Thus, visualizing Bitcoin on a map, nodes and
mining facilities migrate geographically from unfriendly places to
friendlier places over time. Unprofitable mining facilities will shut
down, profitable mining facilities will go online. The same, again, is
true for nodes.</p>

<p>Increasingly, people will migrate to jurisdictions which are more
favorable to their bitcoin holdings. And if you want to start a Bitcoin
company, you might also move to a jurisdiction which is more favorable
to you and your future business.</p>

<p>Finspace: In the last 10 years, many people decided to buy bitcoin,
effectively feeding the Bitcoin organism by investing in it. This
capital allocation will continue as more people understand the nature of
this beast, and the ultimate goal of Bitcoin: the separation of money
and state.</p>

<p>What investors describe as portfolio balancing and allocation of capital can be
seen as a migration of value from worse assets to better assets; from bad stores
of value to better stores of value. Bitcoin, being the ultimate asset in terms
of portability, verifiability, divisibility, scarcity, and unseizability, will
continue to suck up value and grow in the process.</p>

Conclusion

<p>Bitcoin lives at the intersection of three spaces: meatspace, cyberspace,
and finspace. These spaces have different laws, different rules, and different
climates. To fully understand any organism, we must not only look at the
organism itself, but examine the organism-environment holistically.</p>

<p>Because of its decentralized nature, Bitcoin is able to overcome many, if not
all obstacles in its environments. It can migrate to favorable jurisdictions in
meatspace, use different transportation and storage media in cyberspace, and
feed on the instability of other asset classes in finspace.</p>

<p>Whatever the future may bring, Bitcoin is equipped to survive and thrive in the
various environments it lives in. It is remarkably resilient — well adapted to
survive any coming storm, however perfect it may be.</p>

<p>During WWII, Japanese fighters and bombers were manufactured by Mitsubishi, including the A6M Zero, the meatball plane that attacked Pearl Harbor. Propellers and fuel tanks were made by Yamaha. </p>
<p>After the war, Japan was forced to demilitarize. Mitsubishi shifted its manufacturing capabilities to making cars. Yamaha switched to motorcycles.</p>
<p>So here’s Sharp, known for its LCD TVs, announcing that it will repurpose its clean rooms to mass-produce face masks.</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>A clean room is a pressurized facility used for semiconductor fabrication. Because a speck of dust is enough to short out submicron circuitry, everything has to be super sterile. Perfect for producing N95 face masks. Supply chains are too messed up to manufacture TV sets anyway.</p>
<p>Could we do that here? What if the Cold War ended, and instead of lobbying for continued expansion of national defense, companies like Lockheed and Raytheon shifted to a more socially redeeming line of work?</p>
<p>The F-35 Lightning II cost $407 billion to develop. Who is this for, anyway? What third world country are we going to sic this on?</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin could be making motorcycles! Let’s get an American manufacturer into World Superbike for once. Why should the Japanese and Italians have all the fun? </p>
<p>Fun fact: Ducati, which holds the most race wins in all of World Superbike history, was founded as a radio company in Marconi’s hometown of Bologna. During WWII, they made military radios and machine gun parts for the Fascists.</p>
<p>We’re about to face massive medical supply shortages because all our stuff comes from China. What about all those abandoned manufacturing facilities in the US? Could Intel repurpose its decommissioned clean rooms in Santa Clara (where I used to work!) and start making face masks? Or would they be hamstrung by FDA regulations?</p>

  <p>In this epic piece, Robert Breedlove takes a massive dive into Bitcoin, and presents one of the most solid cases for Bitcoin that’s out there.</p><p>That said, it’s not always easy to get the very busy (and skeptical) Ray Dalio’s of the world to sit down for a few hours, so I hope this cover letter can encourage him to have an open mind, and give Bitcoin a few hours of his time. ROI on those few hours could be bigger than any return he’s witnessed in his highly illustrious and successful career.</p>♦<p>Bitcoin is most definitely not an “easy get”. Most ultra-bullish Bitcoiners only become that way due to a deep understanding of the history and properties of money-as-we-know-it, the technology behind Bitcoin, macro, micro and behavioural economics, as well as the dynamics of start-up companies and technologies in bootstrapping themselves and realising network effects. Less technical people observe the IQ density of the space, through its industry leaders and broader development community, which allows for a high level of believability-weighted decision making. I believe you have one of the best grasps of these concepts in the world, so I ask that you humour me for a few minutes to allow me to demonstrate just how much Bitcoin aligns with your personal views and fundamentals. This journey isn’t quick — the most dedicated Bitcoiners have put in thousands of hours of research and knowledge development, as well as many hundreds of days “in the saddle” with exposure to the whims of the Bitcoin Rollercoaster. I hope that by the end of this letter you will at least consider revisiting the topic of Bitcoin with a bit more depth.</p><p>Bitcoin has been likened by some to be reflective of a startup organisation; currently heading into its Series B fund raise. Bitcoin is a well-oiled “un-organization” with founders but no CEOs, many volunteers but no employees, where the best ideas are developed and implemented by consensus regardless of who proposed the idea, and provably non-diluting equity available to anyone who is willing to trade their energy for it. This is all baked into the code, and it is radically transparent for anyone wishing to participate in the ecosystem. So transparent, that an individual can verify anything they need to about the Bitcoin network by simply running some software on a very basic computer setup in the order of $200 and with the most basic of internet connections. It may likely be one of the best real-life examples of an Idea Meritocracy at play — the cultural paradigm that you originated at Bridgewater.</p><p>Idea Meritocracies are microcosms of what a “truly free” market should be. There aren’t many, if any, examples of free markets in the wild; except of course, Bitcoin. The competition in the Bitcoin space is merciless, where the best products having a shelf-life of months before being made redundant by superior products. Most industry leading service providers will find themselves competing with a free product not long after establishing themselves. As at date of writing, the Bitcoin space even meets several criteria of the “theoretical” perfectly competitive market. Bitcoin’s nature as an open-source, public, encrypted, distributed ledger means that the blockchain guarantees radical transparency, property rights and homogeneity of product, at zero or near-zero transaction and storage cost. The factors of production (labour, equipment, and capital) are mobile to the extent that only a communication link and a power source is required to participate in the ecosystem. Developing on top of Bitcoin requires no permission, and if entrepreneurs have a good enough idea, securing start-up capital is not a difficult barrier to entry to overcome. Information asymmetry, low number of market participants, and externalities from use of non-renewable energy to mine will all be resolved in time, most likely by the end of this decade. The critical thing to note is, although there are relatively few people who own the majority of Bitcoin now, once Bitcoin is spent in the future during the redistribution phase, it is spent forever — there are no reprints. If you want your Bitcoin balance to stay the same or increase, you must be creating value for someone. There is no free lunch with Bitcoin.</p><p>A central tenet of your school of thought is open-mindedness, and I encourage you to suspend disbelief and allow yourself to be immersed in high quality Bitcoin content; whether through attending a Bitcoin-only conference, books, podcasts, or even attending your local casual Bitcoin meetup. When meeting Bitcoiners in the real world, you are guaranteed to witness more IQ packed into one small place than you have ever witnessed in your life. Bitcoin was created and fostered by the most radically open-minded, and the development of its technology over time was only possible through radical open-mindedness in the developer community, and of the wider user community once improvements were thoroughly scrutinised and ready to be implemented.</p><p>I’m sure that a lot of these arguments have hit home — after all, you personally coined the majority of the arguments I used to present The Case for Bitcoin. It is daunting and confusing to step into such a revolutionary realm, but you will find that if you are willing to radically open your mind, your fundamentals are 100% aligned with Bitcoin’s.</p>♦

<p>Howdy!  I just want to catch you up on some of the work Su and I have been publishing outside of UCC.</p>



Articles



<p>Contango and Backwardation: A Window into Market Behaviour (by Su and Arthur): In this article, Su and Arthur focus on the phenomena of contango and backwardation and their implications on market structure. </p>



<p>An analysis of developer funding in Bitcoin (by Hasu and Derek Hsue): Here, Derek and I examine the importance of funding open-source development, what funding mechanisms exist, and tradeoffs that each of them brings. We also apply our findings to Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency landscape, analyze how Bitcoin development has been funded in the past, and how it might evolve in the future.</p>



<p>Efficiency, liquidity, and volatility in crypto markets (by Su): Su investigates the counter-intuitive result that while market efficiency has substantially increased over that time period, trading volumes denominated in BTC have actually declined and volatility has remained consistently high. He then discusses similarities of the crypto market structure to that of FX markets.</p>



<p>Rollback or Reimbursement: An Analysis (by Su and Hasu): In light of an index price spike on Deribit, we analyze the pros and cons of rollbacks vs reimbursement for exchanges.</p>



<p>Vertcoin’s 51% attack – a case-study for blockchain security (by Hasu): Using the example of Vertcoin, I show how ASIC resistance hurts the security of a blockchain by making it cheaper to attack.</p>



<p>Perpetual Swaps: Comparisons and Findings (by Su): The perpetual contract is an important product for price discovery and speculation and has the most volume traded as a consequence. Su compares perpetual swaps across different exchanges and highlights key differences that traders should be aware of.</p>



<p>Does Buying Top10 Coins Pay Off? A Concise Study (by Su): In a quick analysis, Su shows how an ETF-like strategy of &#8220;buying the top 10 coins&#8221; would have performed against BTC.</p>



<p>The Great Race to Crypto Banking (by Hasu): Crypto exchanges and their competitors are racing to adopt, -and ultimately democratize- financial services known from legacy finance. The three low hanging fruits are (1) interest accounts, (2) payments, and (3) tax services. Because of the low switching cost for customers, this transformation into crypto-banks will happen much faster than expected, leaving exchanges that don’t follow suit in the dust.</p>



<p>Bruno and Bill: a Story of Broken Trust while Building a Trustless Protocol (by Su and Hedgedhog): Su and Hedgedhog revisit the story of an ICO founder gone rogue to highlight the risks from key man risk, and admin access more generally, in DeFi. Similar risks exist at this point in major protocols like Maker, Compound, and Dydx.</p>



<p>Maker &amp; Taker Fees on Crypto Exchanges: A Market Structure Analysis (by Su): Su explains how the Maker and Taker fee structures have evolved as a result of natural market evolution, and disproves the myth that Maker rebates are a form of &#8220;free lunch&#8221;</p>



<p>How the BCH developer tax affects BTC miners (by Hasu): Using the proposed BCH developer tax as an example, I show how changes in profitability in any of the SHA256 coins necessarily affect all SHA256 miners.</p>



<p>Navigating the Crypto Gambling Wasteland (by Su and Hedgedhog): Su and Hedgedhog speculate why gambling as a crypto use case still hasn&#8217;t taken off.</p>



<p>Understanding Quanto Risk and Opportunity (by Su): In this piece, Su explains Quanto derivatives whose exotic risks fool many inexperienced traders.</p>



<p>No, Concentration Among Miners Isn’t Going to Break Bitcoin (by Hasu): In my first op-ed for Coindesk, I explain why concentration of hashpower (or stake) does not imply insecurity, as miners with more control in a network also have a stronger vested interest in its protection as well.</p>



<p>No, Concentration Among Miners Isn’t Going to Break Bitcoin – Part 2 (by Hasu): After the previous article sparked some excellent discussions on Twitter, I address the best questions and comments in this follow-up piece on hashpower concentration.</p>



Podcasts



<p>Su on &#8220;The Coinist Podcast&#8221;: Su discusses Bitcoin volatility, S2F model, whether ETH can outperform, decentralized exchanges, and things to watch in 2020 with host Luke Martin.</p>



<p>Hasu on &#8220;Into the Ether&#8221;: Eric Connor and I discuss the current state of both the Bitcoin and Ethereum communities and where their current narrative journeys have landed them. We also dive deep into the topics of monetary policy, PoW vs PoS, development funds, and more.</p>



<p>Hasu on &#8220;Amun State of Crypto&#8221;: The Amun team and I dissect what the Bitcoin halving means for the mining space and whether the declining block reward poses a risk for long-term security.</p>



<p>Hasu on &#8220;Ark Invest&#8221;: It is an honor for me be invited to the &#8220;Ark Invest&#8221; podcast, where Yassine and I have a great conversation about Bitcoin&#8217;s security model. I strongly recommend this one if you&#8217;re even remotely interested in blockchain security, as we synthesize much of my previous year&#8217;s work (and the best counterpoints to it) into a single episode.</p>

  ♦It must be refusal, right?<p>If iPhones were as fungible and easy to buy and sell as cryptocurrency, you could buy them, use them and then sell them back again in the market right afterwards.</p><p>They would magically show up in your hands, you would then search something in google, write an email, scroll twitter and then magically disappear to be available for someone else in the international iPhone exchanges.</p><p>If on average you use an iPhone for 3 hours daily or 12,5% of your day, and the cost of transaction would be negligible, you would perform this operation several times a day until covering those 3 hours, while other 21 hours your iPhone would be available for someone else.</p><p>There would be such availability of iPhones that even if Apple claimed that its number would never exceed a certain threshold, people wouldn’t have any incentive to keep them over time, as the cost of access to them would be simply lower than the cost of storing them. It would therefore be uneconomical to keep them with you.</p><p>The cost of storage is the fact that things deteriorate, inflate have some cost of maintenance, even if it is only to avoid losing them.</p><p>As a result, whether it is iPhones or whatever else, you will always try to keep your stuff in whatever has the lower cost of storage, that is, whatever keeps value best.</p><p>The asset with the lowest cost of storage will accumulate all the value as it doesn’t make sense to use assets with second best cost of storage.</p><p>And interestingly, the asset with the lowest cost of storage is not that one where you are promised that its monetary supply will not increase, but rather that one where its monetary supply is written in stone and where it can be credibly claimed that no one will be able to change it.</p><p>Given that no other shitcoin can credibly claim inmutability of its monetary supply, the battle is lost already for anything other than Bitcoin.</p><p>What happens when people learn this and start selling like nuts their shitcoins? It will be a stampede.</p><p>If you are a shitcoin sinner, please let me know if this article has been close to convincing you to sell.</p>♦

  ♦At an early stage, hodlers/bitcoin owners was a very small ratio<p>I know I suck at painting stuff, but I hope I can explain my point better within the next paragraphs.</p><p>In the image:</p><ol><li>Hodlers are represented by the orange color. They are users because they understand Bitcoin’s extremely low cost of storage / maintenance / deterioration / inflation. They are speculators, but in the very long run, and their speculation is based on the bet that they will hardly ever have to sell their coins.</li><li>The green color is the (still) huge number of people who still don’t get Bitcoin but own it only as short term speculators (STS). They have no problem with selling big amounts of their coins and turn them into fiat. Hodlers+ STS= Bitcoin owners</li><li>The white color is the even larger of people who still don’t own Bitcoin (nocoiners)</li></ol><p>My thesis is that information asymmetry is the result of STS guys speculating short term (typically buying at times of FOMO) and selling (typically at times of panic), consequently increasing as such the supply, while hodlers keep their coins with themselves.</p><p>The STS (green) guys get in and out very quickly. They completely destabilize the price.</p><p>A small number of STS have been becoming over time hodlers (orange), very slowly at first, people that understand that Bitcoin is a long term storage of value. They don’t put their coins for sale easily and as a result stabilize the price creating the floor prices we all know and love.</p><p>So how do we create the first FOMO and therefore turn nocoiners into STS?</p><p>That is the role of halvings, and happens every four years.</p>♦Fast forward a few years and Bitcoin understanding grew. The proportion of hodlers among Bitcoin owners is higher.<p>After the first halving, I think that what we are seeing is a very variable green area that creates the volatility, grows very fast at times of FOMO and decreases very fast at times of panic.</p><p>Hodlers on the other hand, grow very slowly, at their own rhythm as Bitcoin understanding grows.</p><p>We live in the information age and nowadays good information is way more widespread so I expect soon that the orange area will grow faster than it used to, even if the green one grows very fast too with the next FOMO.</p><p>Consequently, with a faster growing orange area of hodlers, I expect the next floor in the price to be way higher than many anticipate, especially given that the next bull run is going to be way more mainstream than any other in the past.</p><p>And if this thesis is confirmed, I believe that we are likely to see a situation like this during the next halving of 2024:</p>♦After the next halving of 2024, I expect the proportion of hodlers within the total of Bitcoin owners to be way higher. Volatility should decrease drammatically as a result<p>My point is, Bitcoin understanding can only grow and Bitcoin understanding can only grow FASTER. FOMO is at some point going to be unbelievable and probably difficult to manage for many. That’s why I say that the role of Bitcoin educators is wildly underrated.</p><p>Mine are not the prettiest articles (and pictures) but I appreciate a good discussion and your opinions. Please let me know what you think here or in my twitter account :)</p>♦

  <p>in which I hypothesise that markets are subjective, uncertain, complex, stochastic, adaptive, fractal, reflexive … — really any clever sounding adjective you like — just not efficient.</p><p>(available as pdf here, if desired)</p>♦photo by skeeze, via Pixabay<p>Around a month ago, Nic Carter asked me to have a look at a final draft of his article on the basics of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis. Dancing around the edges of Bitcoin Twitter as I am prone to do, I immediately grasped both the need for and the point of such an article; the question of whether the upcoming ‘halving’ is ‘priced in’ or not had “become a source of great rancor and debate,” as Nic wrote. For the uninitiated, ‘the halving’ is the reduction of the bitcoin block reward from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25, expected around May 2020. Nic set himself the task of explaining the EMH more or less from scratch, in such a way that the explanation would naturally lend itself towards insight on questions of Bitcoin’s market behaviour.</p><p>An Introduction to the Efficient Market Hypothesis for Bitcoiners</p><p>I think he did a great job and the article is well worth reading. But I couldn’t help thinking as I went through it that, basically, I didn’t believe this stuff the first time around, and it all seemed strangely incongruous in a setting explicitly involving Bitcoin, what with the tendency of serious thinkers in this space to treat highly mathematised mainstream / neoclassical financial economics with something between suspicion and disdain.</p><p>To be completely clear, this is in no way a ‘rebuttal’ to Nic. He articulated the EMH very well, but didn’t defend it. That wasn’t the point of his article at all. He watered down the presentation at several points by saying (quite helpful) things like:</p><blockquote>“I do not believe in the ‘strong form’ of the EMH. No finance professional I know does. It is generally a straw man,”</blockquote><p>and,</p><blockquote>“Interestingly, by caveating the EMH, we have stumbled on an alternative conception entirely. The model I have described here somewhat resembles Andrew Lo’s adaptive market hypothesis. Indeed, while I am very happy to maintain that most (liquid) markets are efficient, most of the time, the adaptive market model far more closely captures my views on the markets than any of the generic EMH formulations.”</blockquote><p>One passage in particular stuck out to me:</p><blockquote>“Referring to it as a model makes it very clear that it’s just an abstraction of the world, a description of the way markets should (and generally do) work, but by no means an iron law. It’s just a useful way to think about markets.”</blockquote><p>This is where I’m not so sure. Yes, it’s an abstraction, and no, it’s not an iron law. But I don’t think it’s a terribly good abstraction, and I think the reason is that it subtly contradicts and elides what are, in fact, iron laws, or as close to iron laws as can be found in economics. It’s a useful way to think about markets, to a point, but I want to explore what I think is a more useful way.</p><p>My argument will go through the following propositions, which serve as headings for their own sub-sections of discussion: value is subjective; uncertainty is not risk; economic complexity resists equilibria; markets aggregate prices, not information; and, markets tend to leverage efficiency.</p><p>I will conclude with some additional commentary on Andrew Lo’s Adaptive Markets Hypothesis and Benoit Mandelbrot’s interpretation of fractal geometry in financial markets, simply because, of all the reading around this topic that was thrown up by Nic’s article, these two were by far the most intriguing. I didn’t want to do either an injustice by bending their arguments too far to make them fit my own, but I think that they can be very fruitfully analysed with the conceptual tools we will have developed by the conclusion of the essay. I will also occasionally invoke the concepts of ‘reflexivity’, as articulated by George Soros in The Alchemy of Finance, and several concepts popularised and articulated by Nassim Taleb, such as ‘skin in the game’, ‘black swans’, and ‘robustness’.</p><p>This might seem like an excessive coverage list just to offer a counter to the claim that markets are ‘efficient’ — which seems pretty reasonable in and of itself. If it is at all reassuring to the reader before diving in, I don’t think my thesis has five intimidating-sounding propositions, so much as one quite simple idea, from which many related propositions can be shown to follow. I think that, fundamentally, the efficient markets hypothesis is contradicted by the implications of value being subjective, and that some basic elements of complex systems are helpful, in places, to nudge the reasoning along. This essay is an attempt to tease these implications out.</p><p>Value is Subjective</p><p>You shouldn’t compare apples and oranges, except that sometimes you have to, like when you are hungry. If apples and oranges are the same price, you need to make a decision that simply cannot be mathematised. You either like apples more than oranges, or vice versa. And actually, even this may not be true. Maybe you know full well you like oranges, but you just feel like an apple today, or you need apples for a pie recipe for which oranges would be très gauche. This reasoning is readily extended in all directions; which is objectively better, a novel by Dickens or Austen? A hardback or an ebook by either, or anybody? And what about the higher order capital goods that go into producing apples, oranges, novels, Kindles, and the like? Clearly they are ‘worth’ only whatever their buyer subjectively assesses as likely to be a worthwhile investment given the (again) subjective valuations of others as to the worth of apples, oranges, novels, and whatnot …</p><p>This is all fine and dandy; readily understood since the marginal revolution of Menger, Jevons, and Walras in the 1870s rigorously refuted cost and labour theories of value. As Menger put it in his magisterial Principles of Economics,</p><blockquote>“Value is thus nothing inherent in goods, no property of them, nor an independent thing existing by itself. It is a judgment economizing men make about the importance of the goods at their disposal for the maintenance of their lives and well-being. Hence value does not exist outside the consciousness of men.”</blockquote><p>Fair enough. But the first seductive trappings of the EMH come from the rarely articulated assumption that such essential subjectivity is erased in financial markets because the goods in the market are defined only in terms of cash flows. There may not be a scientific answer as to whether apples are better than oranges, but surely $10 is better than $5? And surely $10 now is better than $10 in the future? But what about $5 now or $10 in the future?</p><p>There are (at least) two reasons this reductionism is misleading. The first comes from the mainstream neoclassical treatment of temporal discounting, which is to assume that only exponential discounting can possibly be “optimal”. The widespread prevalence of alternative approaches — hyperbolic discounting, for example — is then usually treated via behavioural economics, as a deviation from optimality that is evidence of irrational cognitive biases.</p><p>This has been challenged by a recently published preprint paper by Alex Adamou, Yonatan Berman, Diomides Mavroyiannis, and Ole Peters, entitled The Microfoundations of Discounting (arXiv link here) arguing that the single assumption of an individual aiming to optimise the growth rate of her wealth can generate different discounting regimes that are optimal relative to the conditions by which her wealth grows in the first place. This in turn rests on the relationship between her current wealth and the payments that may be received. Sometimes this the discounting that pops out is exponential, sometimes hyperbolic, sometimes something else entirely. It depends on her circumstances.</p><p>I would editorialise here that an underlying cause of confusion is that people value time itself, and, naturally, do so subjectively. It may be fair enough to say that they typically want to use their time as efficiently as possible — or grow their wealth the fastest — but this is rather vacuous in isolation. Padding it out with circumstantial information immediately runs into the fact that everybody’s circumstances are different. As Adamou said on Twitter shortly after the paper’s first release, not many 90-year olds play the stock market. It’s funny because it’s true.</p><p>And it is easy to see how this result can be used as a wedge to pry open a conceptual can of worms. In financial markets, there are far more variables to compare than just the discount rate — and if we can’t even assess an objective discount rate, we really are in trouble! In choosing between financial assets we are choosing between non-deterministic streams of future cash flows, as well as (maybe — who knows?) desiring to preserve some initial capital value.</p><p>Assume these cash flows are ‘risky’, in the sense that we can assign probabilities to their space of outcomes. In the following section, we will see that really the cash flows are not ‘risky’, but ‘uncertain’, which makes this problem even worse — but we can stick with ‘risky’ for now as it works well enough to make the point. There can be no objective answer because different market participants could easily have different risk preferences, exposure preferences, liquidity needs, timeframes, and so on.</p><p>Timeframes are worth dwelling on for a second longer (there’s ‘time’ again) because this points to an ill-definition in my hasty setup of the problem: to what space of outcomes are we assigning probabilities, exactly? Financial markets do not have an end-point, so this makes no sense on the face of it. If we amend it by suggesting (obviously ludicrously) that the probabilities are well-defined for every interval’s end-point, forever, then we invite the obvious criticism that different participants may care about different sequences of intervals. Particularly if their different discount rates (which we admitted they must have) have a different effect on how far in the future cash flows have to come to be discounted back to a value that is negligible in the present. Once again, people value time itself subjectively.</p><p>In the readily understood language employed just above, market participants almost certainly have different circumstances to one another, from which different subjective valuations will naturally emerge. What seems to you like a stupidly low price at which to sell an asset might be ideal for the seller because they are facing a margin call elsewhere in their portfolio (see Nic’s cited example of what blew up LTCM despite it being a ‘rational bet’), or because they hold too much of this asset for their liking and want to rebalance their exposure. Or perhaps some price might seem stupidly high to buy, but the buyer has a funding gap so large that they need to invest in something that has a non-zero probability of appreciating by that much. If you need to double your money, then the ‘risk-free asset’ is infinitely risky. There is no right answer, because value is subjective.</p><p>Uncertainty is not Risk</p><p>‘Risk’ characterises a nondeterministic system for which the space of possible outcomes can be assigned probabilities. Expected values are meaningful and hence prices, if they exist in such a system, lend themselves to effective hedging. ‘Uncertainty’ characterises a nondeterministic system for which probabilities cannot be assigned to the space of outcomes. Uncertain outcomes cannot be hedged. This distinction in economics is usually credited to Frank Knight and his wonderful 1921 book, Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. In the introduction, Knight writes,</p><blockquote>“It will appear that a measurable uncertainty, or “risk” proper, as we shall use the term, is so far different from an unmeasurable one that it is not in effect an uncertainty at all. We shall accordingly restrict the term “uncertainty” to cases of the non-quantitive type. It is this “true” uncertainty, and not risk, as has been argued, which forms the basis of a valid theory of profit and accounts for the divergence between actual and theoretical competition.”</blockquote><p>Keynes is often also credited an excellent exposition,</p><blockquote>“By “uncertain” knowledge, let me explain, I do not mean merely to distinguish what is known for certain from what is only probable. The game of roulette is not subject, in this sense, to uncertainty… Or, again, the expectation of life is only slightly uncertain. Even the weather is only moderately uncertain. The sense in which I am using the term is that in which the prospect of a European war is uncertain, or the price of copper and the rate of interest twenty years hence, or the obsolescence of a new invention, or the position of private wealth owners in the social system in 1970. About these matters there is no scientific basis on which to form any calculable probability whatever. We simply do not know. Nevertheless, the necessity for action and for decision compels us as practical men to do our best to overlook this awkward fact and to behave exactly as we should if we had behind us a good Benthamite calculation of a series of prospective advantages and disadvantages, each multiplied by its appropriate probability, waiting to be summed.”</blockquote><p>The conclusion of the Keynes passage is particularly insightful as it gets at why it is so important to be clear on the difference, which otherwise might seem like little more than semantics: people need to act. They will strive for a basis to treat uncertainty as if it were risk so as to tackle it more easily, but however successful they are or are not, they must act nonetheless.</p><p>The Knight extract hints at the direction of the book’s argument, which I will summarise here: that profit is the essence of competitive uncertainty. Were there no uncertainty, but merely quantifiable risk in patterns of production and consumption, competition would drive all prices to a stable and commoditised equilibrium. In financial vocabulary, we would say there would be no such thing as a sustainable competitive advantage. The cost of capital would be the risk-free rate, as would all returns on capital, meaning profit is minimised. In aggregate, profit would function merely as a kind of force pulling all economic activity to this precise point of strong attraction.</p><p>But of course, uncertainty is very real, as Keynes’ quote makes delightfully clear. I would argue, in fact, that in the economic realm it is a direct consequence of subjective value; in engaging in pursuing profit, you are guessing what others will value. As Knight later writes,</p><blockquote>“With uncertainty present, doing things, the actual execution of activity, becomes in a real sense a secondary part of life; the primary problem or function is deciding what to do and how to do it.”</blockquote><p>So far I have danced around the key word and concept here, so as to try to let the reader arrive at it herself, but this ‘deciding what to do and how to do it’, and ‘pursuing profit’, we call entrepreneurship. In a world with uncertainty, the role of the entrepreneur is to shoulder the uncertainty of untried combinations of capital, the success of which will ultimately be dependent on the subjective valuations of others. This is not something that can be calculated or mathematised, as any entrepreneur (or VC) will tell you. As Ross Emmett noted in his centennial review of Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit, it is no coincidence that the word ‘judgment’ appears on average every two pages in the book.</p><p>There are two points about the process of entrepreneurship that I believe ought to be explored further, and which lead us to Soros and Taleb: you can’t just imagine starting a business; you have to actually do it in order to learn anything. And, in order to do it, you have to expose yourself to your own successes and failures. Your experiment changes the system in which you are experimenting, and you will inevitably have a stake in the experiment’s result.</p><p>This is fertile ground in which to plant Soros’ theory of reflexivity. As briefly as possible, and certainly not doing it justice, Soros believes that financial markets are fundamentally resistant to truly scientific analysis because they can only be fully understood in such a way that acknowledges the fact that thinking about the system influences the system. He writes that the scientific method:</p><blockquote>“is clearly not applicable to reflexive situations because even if all the observable facts are identical, the prevailing views of the participants are liable to be different when an experiment is repeated. The very fact that an experiment has been conducted is liable to change the perceptions of the participants. Yet, without testing, generalisations cannot be falsified.”</blockquote><p>All potential entrepreneurial activity is uncertain (by definition) but the fact of engaging in it crystallises the knowledge of its success or failure. The subjective valuations on which its success depends are revealed by the experiment, and you can’t repeat the experiment pretending you don’t now know this information. Alternatively, this can be conceived of in terms of the difference between thinking and acting, or talking and doing. In a reflexive environment, you can’t say what would have happened had you done something, because, had you done it, you would have changed the circumstances that lead to you now claiming you would have done it. As Yogi Berra (allegedly) said, “in theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice, there is,” and as Amy Adams vigorously proclaims in Talladega Nights, quite the treatise on risk and uncertainty by the way, and with a criminally underrated soundtrack, “Ricky Bobby is not a thinker. Ricky Bobby is a driver.”</p>medium.com/media/13fb3a857d69144075a64ddc9ec34a2f/href<p>We can also now invoke ‘skin in the game’, a phrase of dubious origin, but nowadays associated primarily with Nassim Taleb, and expounded in his 2017 book of the same name. Again, not doing it justice (he did write a whole book about this) Taleb believes that people ought to have equal exposure to the potential upsides and downsides of their decisions; ‘ought to’ in both a moral sense of deserving the outcome, but also in the sense of optimal system design, in that such an arrangement encourages people to behave the most prudently out of all possible incentive schemes. It readily applies here in that braving the wild uncertainties of entrepreneurship requires capital — it requires a stake on which the entrepreneur might get the upside of profit, but might get the downside of loss. I say ‘might’ because you cannot possibly know the odds of such a wager. It relies not on risk, but on uncertainty. As Taleb writes, “entrepreneurs are heroes in our society. They fail for the rest of us.”</p><p>The combined appreciation of ‘judgment’ and ‘skin in the game’ is key to understanding what entrepreneurs are actually doing. They do not merely throw capital into a combinatorial vacuum; they are intuiting the wants and needs of potential customers. And as I simply cannot resist the opportunity to employ, possibly my favourite quote from any economist, ever: as Alex Tabarrok says, a bet is a tax on bullshit. Or, don’t talk; do.</p>♦my desk at work. It’s good to keep these things in mind.<p>That same Emmett review of Knight’s book noted that the very concept of Knightian uncertainty re-emerged in the public consciousness around a decade ago due to two events: the role ironically played by financial risk instruments in the financial crisis, which neoclassical economists had up until that point insisted would reduce uncertainty in markets (search for “Raghuram Rajan Jackson Hole” if unfamiliar); and Taleb publishing the bestseller The Black Swan.</p><p>( Although, naturally, Taleb deplores the concept of ‘Knightian Uncertainty’. What I believe Taleb truly objects to, however, is how the concept has come to be used, rather than anything Knight himself believed. Economists often invoke ‘Knightian Uncertainty’ as a sleight of hand to demarcate some corner of reality, and imply that everywhere else is merely ‘risky’ and can be modelled. This is nonsense. In real life, everything is uncertain, or, as Joseph Walker succinctly put, “Taleb’s problem with Knightian uncertainty is that there’s no such thing as non-Knightian uncertainty.” I think Knight would almost certainly agree, as would anybody who has actually read Knight, instead of employing his name in the course of macro-bullshitting, as Taleb would put it.)</p><p>Writes Emmett,</p><blockquote>“Taleb did not suggest that uncertainty could be handled by risk markets. Instead, he made a very Knightian argument: since you cannot protect yourself entirely against uncertainty, you should build robustness into your personal life, your company, your economic theory, and even the institutions of your society, to withstand uncertainty and avoid tragic results. These actions imply costs that may limit other aspects of your business, and even your openness to new opportunity.”</blockquote><p>But enough about entrepreneurship, what about financial markets? Well, financial markets are readily understood as one degree removed from entrepreneurship. With adequate mental flexibility, you can think of them as markets for fractions of entrepreneurial activity. Entrepreneurship-by-proxy, we might say. If you want, you can use them to mimic the uncertainty profile of an entrepreneur: your ‘portfolio’ could be 100% the equity of the company you wish you founded. Or 200%, with leverage, if you are really gung-ho! But most people think precisely the opposite way: markets present the opportunity to tame the rabid uncertainty of entrepreneurship in isolation, and skim some portion of its aggregate benefit.</p><p>There is an additional complication. The fact of such markets usually being liquid enough to enable widespread ownership creates the incentive to think not about the underlying entrepreneurship at all, but only about the expectations of other market participants — to ignore the fundamentals and consider only the valuation. There are shades of Soros’ reflexivity here. The market depends to some extent on the thinking of those participating in the market about the market. This is sometimes called a Keynesian beauty contest, after Keynes’ analogy of judging a beauty contest not on the basis of who you think is most beautiful, but on the basis of who you think others will think is the most beautiful. But if everybody is doing that, then you really need to judge on the basis of who you think others will think others will think is the most beautiful, and so on. Unlike the entrepreneur, who must only worry about the subjective valuation of his potential customers, participants in financial markets must worry, in addition, about the subjective valuation of this subjective valuation by other market participants. There is often grumbling at this point that this represents ‘speculation’ as opposed to ‘investment’, and I certainly buy the idea that over time periods long enough to reflect real economic activity allowed for by the investments, such concerns will make less and less of a difference. As Benjamin Graham famously said, “in the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine”. But the voting still happens. It is clearly real and needs to be accounted for. Risk is once again useless. Uncertainty abounds.</p><p>This range of possibilities is intriguing and points to a deeper understanding of what financial markets really are: the aim of a great deal of finance is to grapple with the totality of uncertainty inherent in entrepreneurial activity — equally well understood as ‘investment of capital’, given the need for a ‘stake’ — by partitioning it into different exposures that can sensibly be described as relatively more or less ‘risky’. The aim of doing so is generally to minimise the cost of capital going towards real investment by tailoring the packaging of uncertainty to the ‘risk profiles’ of those willing to invest, as balanced by escalating transaction costs if this process becomes too fine-grained.</p><p>This is the essence of a capital structure: the more senior the capital claim, the better defined the probability space of outcomes for that instrument. Uncertainty in aggregate cannot be altered, nor can its influence be completely removed from individual instruments, but exposure to uncertainty can be unevenly parcelled out amongst instruments.</p><p>This suggests a far more sophisticated understanding of ‘the risk/reward trade-off’ and ‘the equity premium’ than is generally accepted in the realm of modern portfolio theory, and, by extension, the EMH: bonds are likely to get a lower return than stocks not because they are less ‘risky’ (which in that context is even more questionably interpreted as ‘less volatile’) but because they are engineered to be less uncertain. The burden of uncertainty is deliberately shifted from debt to equity. You don’t get a ‘higher reward’ for taking on the ‘risk/volatility’ of equities; you deliberately expose yourself to the uncertain possibility of a greater reward in exchange for accepting an uncertain possibility of a greater loss.</p><p>It is worth pondering for a second that this is arguably why the ‘equity risk premium’ even exists (and why neoclassical economists are so confused about it, while financial professionals are not in the slightest) — if there really were no uncertainty in investment and every enterprise — and hence every financial instrument linked to it — had a calculable risk profile, then price discrepancies derivable from expectation values could be arbitraged away. There would be no equity risk premium — nor a risk premium of any kind on any asset. Everything would be priced correctly and volatility would be zero. That volatility is never zero clearly invalidates this idea. I suggest that the distinction between risk and uncertainty provides at least part of the explanation: unless, by remarkable coincidence, every market participant’s opportunity costs (of exposure, liquidity, time, etc.) and perception of uncertainty (of fundamentals, other’ perceptions of fundamentals, others’ perception of others’ perceptions, etc.) is all identical, and remains so over a period of time, price-altering trading will occur.</p><p>(I will note in passing that this commentary is merely intended to provide the intuition that something is amiss with the ‘equity premium puzzle’. It is incomplete as an explanation. In the later section on leverage efficiency, I will cover Peters’ and Adamou’s more formal proof of the puzzle’s non-puzzliness.)</p><p>An important concept to appreciate in the context of uncertainty is that of ‘heuristics’. This is an important loose-end to tie up before moving on from uncertainty, along with one more, ‘randomness and unpredictability’, which I cover shortly. This is quite a simple idea that originates with Herbert Simon and has been taken up with force more recently by Gerd Gigerenzer of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, and more obliquely by Taleb. Simon’s framing began by assuming that individuals do not in fact have perfect information, nor the resources to compute perfectly optimal decisions. Given these constraints, Simon proposed that individuals demonstrate bounded rationality; they will be as rational as they can given the information and resources they actually have. This probably sounds straightforward enough — perhaps tautological — but notice it flies in the face of behavioural economics, which tends to cover for neoclassical economics by saying, effectively, that since information and competition are perfect, risk is always defined and the optimal decision can always be calculated, but the reason people don’t do so is that they are hopelessly irrational. I have always thought this is quite silly on the face of it, but it is clearly also seductive. Anybody reading the likes of Thinking, Fast and Slow immediately gets the intellectual rush of thinking everybody is stupid except him.</p><p>Bounded rationality encourages the development of ‘heuristics’, which the reader may recall behavioural economists railing against. A heuristic is effectively a rule of thumb for dealing with an uncertain environment that you are pretty sure will work even if you can’t explain why, precisely. The classic example is that of a dog and a frisbee, or an outfielder in baseball catching a flyball: the outfielder could solve enough differential equations to calculate the spot the ball will land, but the dog certainly can’t. And it turns out that neither do: in real life, they adjust their running speed and direction such that the angle at which they see the frisbee or ball stays constant. And it works. No equations required. Yippee.</p><p>(Farrington’s Heuristic is another good example, which I made up while editing a later version of this essay— if a writer is discussing risk, uncertainty, knowledge, and the like, if he refers to Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, and if he is not obviously joking, then everything else he says can immediately be dismissed because he is a bullshitting charlatan enamoured by cargo cult math. This heuristic has only one binary parameter — ‘is he joking?’ — and so is highly robust. In case anybody cares, the theorems are NOT about ‘knowledge’: they are about provability within first order formal logical theories strong enough to model the arithmetic of the natural numbers. This is quite a specific mathematical thing that bears no relation whatsoever to epistemology or metaphysics. Also, there are two of them, which turns out to be important if you understand what the first one says.)</p><p>The implied simplicity of heuristics has subtle mathematical importance, also. A more technical way of specifying this is to say that they have very few parameters — discrete, independent information inputs to the decision procedure — ideally they could even have zero. In a purely risky environment (if such a thing exists, which, in real life, it almost certainly does not) a decision procedure ought to have as many parameters as are needed to capture the underlying probability distribution. But the more uncertainty you add to such an environment, the more dangerous this becomes, essentially because what you are doing is fine-tuning your model to an environment that simply no longer exists. Eventually you will get an unforeseen fluctuation so large that your overfitted model gives you a truly awful suggestion. Heuristics are robust to such circumstances in light of having very few parameters to begin with. Think back to the outfielder: imagine he solves all the necessary fluid dynamical equations, taking account of the fly ball’s mass, velocity, and rotation, the air’s viscosity, the turbulence generated, and so on. If there is then a gust of wind, he’s screwed. His calculation will be completely wrong. But if he embraces the heuristic of just looking at the damn ball this won’t matter!</p><p>Interested readers are encouraged to peruse Gigerenzer’s recent(ish) work on the use of heuristics in finance, and their abuse in behavioural economics, which recently got a shout out in Bloomberg, or this video which is a great introduction to Gigerenzer’s ideas, as well as their connection to Taleb’s more informal thinking on the same topic. (also, note the number of times Gigerenzer uses the word ‘complex’. It is no coincidence that this is a lot, as we shall shortly see):</p><p>The video linked to is around an hour and a half, so the reader need not take such a detour now, but I would encourage it at some point, as both Gigerenzer and Taleb are excellent. My favourite excerpt comes around the 19-minute mark, when Gigerenzer recalls that Harry Markowitz — considered the founder of modern portfolio theory — didn’t actually use any Nobel-prize winning modern portfolio theory for his own retirement portfolio; he used the zero-parameter 1/n approach. If one were being especially mean-spirited, one might say that he didn’t want his own bullshit to be taxed. And as it turns out, in order for the Markowitz many-many-many parameter approach to investing to consistently outperform 1/n, you would need around 500 years of data to finetune the parameters. Of course, you also need the market to not change at all in that time. Good luck with that.</p><p>Since markets feature multitudes of interrelated uncertainties, it is reasonable to expect participants to interact with them not with the perfect rationality of provably optimal behaviour, but with the bounded rationality of heuristics, which are selected on the basis of judgment, intuition, creativity, etc. Basically, people mostly are not stupid. And if they are, they have skin in the game, so they get punished, and possibly wiped out.</p><p>A kind of nice, conceptual corollary to ‘risk is not uncertainty’ is, ‘unpredictability is not randomness’. There can be unpredictable events that are not random, and randomness that is not unpredictable. The difference essentially comes down to ‘causation’. Think of Keynes’ example of the obsolescence of a new invention. This is ‘unpredictable’ not because it is subject to an extremely complicated probability density function, but because the path of causation that would lead to such a situation involves too much uncertainty to coherently grasp. Or think of the bitcoin mining process. The time series of the first non-zero character in the hash of every block is certifiably random, but it is not unpredictably random. It is the result of a highly coordinated and purposeful effort. It doesn’t spring forth from beta decay. Because we understand the causal process by which this time series emerges, we can predict this randomness very effectively.</p><p>A key building block of the EMH is the ‘random walk hypothesis’: the idea that you can ‘prove’ using statistical methods that stock prices follow ‘random walks’ — a kind of well-defined and genuinely random mathematical behaviour. But you can do no such thing. You can prove that they are indistinguishable from random walks, but that is really just saying you can use a statistical test to prove that some data can pass a statistical test. If you understand what causes price movements, you will arrive at no such nonsense as claiming that the moves are, themselves, random. They very probably look random because they are fundamentally unpredictable from the data. And they are fundamentally unpredictable from the data because they derive from the incalculable interplay of millions of market participants’ subjective assessments of the at-root uncertain process of entrepreneurship.</p><p>None of this is based on randomness, nor ‘risk’, nor ‘luck’. It is based on the unknown and unknowable profit that results from intuiting the results of untried and unrepeatable experiments and backing one’s intuition with skin in the game.</p><p>Before moving on, I think it is worth tying all of this to where it is more tangibly sensible, lest the reader not quite know what to do with it all. A big deal was made recently about Netflix being by far the best performing US mid-to-large-cap stock of the 2010s. Netflix is useful as an example because of the scale of its success, but note the following argument does not depend on scale at all. While you could craft an explanation as complicated as you like, I think saying, streaming is better than cable, pretty much does it, once added to all the circumstantial factors to do with the competitive and technological environment. Now imagine an investor in 2010 whose thesis was that streaming is better than cable and would likely win in the long run, who surveyed the competitive environment, and decided Netflix would be a good investment. Is their outperformance over the next 10 years ‘luck’? Was all the ‘information’ ‘in the price’ in 2010? Would the CAPM tell you what the price should have been? Did the stock go for a nice little random walk to the moon?</p><p>This is clearly an insane interpretation. Consider the alternative: The investor better intuited the subjective values of future consumers than did the average market participant. Very likely she justified this on the basis of a heuristic or two. She staked capital on this bet — which was not risky and random, but uncertain and unpredictable — and exposed herself to a payoff that turned out to be huge, because she was right! To the peddlers of the EMH, rational expectations, perfect information, and the like, this obviously sensible interpretation is utterly heretical.</p><p>Economic Complexity Resists Equilibria</p><p>The link between profit and entrepreneurship can be tugged at ever-so-slightly further, and invites a brief detour into the basics of complex systems. The argument goes more or less as follows: the discussion on uncertainty needn’t be interpreted as a call to abandon mathematical analysis altogether — just the sloppy mathematics of risk and randomness that has effectively no connection to the real world. There is an alternative mathematical approach, however, which directly addresses and contradicts the standard neoclassical formalism.</p><p>The starting point is Israel Kirzner, widely considered one of the foremost scholars of entrepreneurship, and his book, Competition and Entrepreneurship. One of Kirzner’s theses is a positive argument that has roughly two parts, as follows: first, entrepreneurship is by its nature non-exclusionary. It is a price discrepancy between the costs of available factors of production and the revenues to be gained by employing them in a particular way — or, profit. In other words, it is perfectly competitive. It does not rely on any privileged position with respect to access to assets; The assets are presumed to be available on the market. They are just not yet employed in that way, but could be, with capital that is presumably homogeneous. Anybody could do so. The only barrier is that of the willingness to judge and stake on uncertainty. He writes,</p><blockquote>“The entrepreneur’s activity is essentially competitive. And thus competition is inherent in the nature of the entrepreneurial market process. Or, to put it the other way around, entrepreneurship is inherent in the competitive market process.”</blockquote><p>This notion of what ‘competition’ really means is highly antithetical to the neoclassical usage. In fact, it is more or less the exact opposite. Rather than meaning something like, tending towards abnormal profit and hence away from equilibrium, the neoclassicals mean, tending towards equilibrium and hence away from abnormal profit. Kirzner bemoans this,</p><blockquote>“Clearly, if a state of affairs is to be labelled competitive, and if this label is to bear any relation to the layman’s use of the term, the term must mean either a state of affairs from which competitive activity (in the layman’s sense) is to be expected or a state of affairs that is the consequence of competitive activity … [Yet] competition, to the equilibrium price theorist, turned out to refer to a state of affairs into which so many competing participants have already entered that no room remains for additional entry (or other modification of existing market conditions). The most unfortunate aspect of this use of the term ‘competition’; is of course that, by referring to the situation in which no room remains for further steps in the competitive market process, the word has come to be understood as the very opposite of the kind of activity of which that process consists. Thus, as we shall discover, any real-world departure from equilibrium conditions came to be stamped as the opposite of ‘competitive’ and hence, by simple extension, as actually ‘monopolistic’.”</blockquote><p>I’d note in passing the delightful similarity in the concluding thought of this extract to the argument of Peter Thiel’s Zero to One, considered by many a kind of spiritual bible for — you guessed it — entrepreneurship. Anyway …</p><p>Kirzner’s second positive argument is that correcting this conceptual blunder leads one to realise that a realistic description of competitive markets would be not as constantly at equilibrium, but rather as constantly out of equilibrium. And that’s really all we need to move on to complex systems.</p><p>Complex systems are commonly associated with the Santa Fe Institute, and popularised by W. Mitchell Waldrop’s fantastic popular science book, Complexity. Waldrop focuses, for the most part, on one of the SFI’s first ever workshops, held between a group of physicists and economists in 1987. The proceedings of the workshop are fantastic, have aged very well, and seem to your author cheap relative to his subjective valuation of them at ~$70 in paperback or ~$140 in hardback. My thinking here comes from the very first paper of the workshop, W. Brian Arthur’s now somewhat infamous work on increasing returns. To get a sense of what I mean by ‘infamous’, consider the following from Waldrop:</p><blockquote>“Arthur had convinced himself that increasing returns pointed the way to the future for economics, a future in which he and his colleagues would work alongside the physicists and the biologists to understand the messiness, the upheaval, and the spontaneous self-organisation of the world. He’d convinced himself that increasing returns could be the foundation for a new and very different kind of economic science.</blockquote><blockquote>Unfortunately, however, he hadn’t much luck convincing anybody else. Outside of his immediate circle at Stanford, most economists thought his ideas were — strange. Journal editors were telling him that this increasing-returns stuff ‘wasn’t economics.’ In seminars, a good fraction of the audience reacted with outrage: how dare he suggest that the economy was not in equilibrium! ”</blockquote><p>Readers can probably sense where this is going.</p><p>Arthur’s paper at the workshop, Self-Reinforcing Mechanisms in Economics, is a breath of fresh air if you have ever slogged through the incessant cargo cult math of neoclassical financial economics (as I had to in researching this essay — thanks a lot, Nic!) It is frankly just all so sensible! Okay, so there are a few differential equations, but only after ten pages of things that are obviously true, and only to frame the obviously true observations in the absurd formalism of the mainstream.</p><p>To begin with, “conventional economic theory is built largely on the assumption of diminishing returns on the margin (local negative feedbacks); and so it may seem that positive feedback, increasing-returns-on-the-margin mechanisms ought to be rare.” Standard neoclassical theory assumes competition pushes all into equilibrium, from which a deviation is punished by the negative feedback of reduced profits. So far, so good.</p><blockquote>“Self-reinforcement goes under different labels in these different parts of economics: increasing returns; cumulative causation; deviation-amplifying mutual causal processes; virtuous and vicious circles; threshold effects; and non-convexity. The sources vary. But usually self-reinforcing mechanisms are variants of or derive from four generic sources: large set-up or fixed costs (which give the advantage of falling unit costs to increased output); learning effects (which act to improve products or lower their cost as their prevalence increases); coordination effects (which confer advantages to ‘going along’ with other economics agents taking similar action); and adaptive expectations (where increased prevalence on the market enhances beliefs of further prevalence).”</blockquote><p>Now we are getting into the meat of it. An example or two wouldn’t hurt before applying this to entrepreneurship and markets.</p><p>Arthur likes Betamax versus VHS — which is a particularly good example in hindsight because we know that VHS won despite being mildly technologically inferior. Point number 1: If a manufacturer of VHS tapes spends an enormous amount on the biggest VHS (or Betamax) factory in the world, then the marginal costs of producing VHS will be lower from that point on. Even if the factory as a whole is loss making, the costs are sunk, and so the incentive is to pump out VHS by the gallon. The fact that this can be done so cheaply makes consumers more likely to choose VHS over Betamax, which will in turn justify the initial expense and contribute positive feedback (via profit).</p><p>Point number 2: doing so may give the owner of the factory the experience to learn how to do so even more efficiently in the future. By the same eventual mechanism as above, this contributes positive feedback via lower prices. (interested readers are encouraged to look into ‘Wright’s Law’, in particular a recent paper by Béla Nagy, Doyne Famer, Quan Bui, and Jessika Trancik, which basically says that Moore’s Law happens for everything, just slower; or, we learn by doing)</p><p>Points number 3 and 4: if more people seem to be buying VHS tapes than Betamax, then producers of Betamax players are incentivised to shift production towards VHS players instead. Cheaper VHS players incentivise consumers to buy more VHS tapes. The appearance of VHS winning this battle causes economic agents to adapt their behaviour in such a way that makes VHS more likely to actually win. In glancing over an early draft of this essay, Nic kindly pointed out to me that this represents the dominant philosophy behind growth VC from 2015 until WeWorkGate, as if a bunch of zealous, born-again Arthurians were playing a game of non-iterated prisoner’s dilemma with other people’s money. Anyway …</p><p>Arthur writes, “if Betamax and its rival VHS compete, a small lead in market share gained by one of the technologies may enhance its competitive position and help it further increase its lead. There is positive feedback. If both systems start out at the same time, market shares may fluctuate at the outset, as external circumstances and ‘luck’ change, and as backers manoeuvre for advantage. And if the self-reinforcing mechanism is strong enough, eventually one of the two technologies may accumulate enough advantage to take 100% of the market. Notice however we cannot say in advance which one this will be.”</p><p>While Arthur mostly considers realistic examples in economics which have discrete end-states that are then ‘locked into’, such as settling on VHS over Betamax, or Silicon Valley over Massachusetts Route 128, my contention would be that every one of these features describes a part of the process of entrepreneurial competition. The fact of staking capital at all towards an uncertain end represents a fixed cost which must be matched by competitors, and after which unit costs fall. As we have mentioned several times, entrepreneurs learn from the result of their experiments and improve their own processes. There is a clear coordination effect for customers in the default assumption of doing whatever other customers are doing. And adaptive expectations are likewise fairly straightforwardly applied: we tend to assume that businesses will continue to exist and that we can continue to act as their customers. Businesses tend to assume the same of their customers within reasonable bounds of caution. The specific positive feedback as a result of each individual effect is that of ‘profit’ — it is positive in the sense that it can be reinvested in the enterprise and allow it to grow.</p><p>Of course, it is possible that these effects would diminish and the marginal feedback become negative. But what we are more tangibly proposing here is that any once-existing competitive advantage has been completely eroded away. This only happens when the product itself becomes either obsolete in light of a superior competitor, or completely commoditised. The former is simply more of the same at the macro level, but the latter we can in turn explain by uncertainty becoming so minimal that we can more or less safely assume it is merely risk. Such circumstances are few and far between. Uncertainty is prevalent in all aspects of economic life, as we have discussed. My argument here is that, so, therefore, are increasing returns and positive feedback loops.</p><p>To bring in Arthur one last time:</p><blockquote>“if self-reinforcement is not offset by countervailing forces, local positive feedbacks are present. In turn, these imply that deviations from certain states are amplified. These states are therefore unstable. If the vector-field associated with the system is smooth and if its critical points — its ‘equilibria’ — lie in the interior of some manifold, standard Poincaré-index topological arguments imply the existence of other critical points or cycles that are stable, or attractors. In this case multiple equilibria must occur. Of course, there is no reason that the number of these should be small. Schelling gives the practical example of people seating themselves in an auditorium, each with the desire to sit beside others. Here the number of steady-states or ‘equilibria’ would be combinatorial.”</blockquote><p>Recall there is no way to know from the starting point which steady-state will be settled into. And of course, Arthur is only talking about specific economic circumstances, not the aggregate of all economic behaviour. The aggregate will likely have shades of evolution in a competitive environment (another concept we will soon encounter in more detail): many, many such interdependent sub-systems, always moving towards their own steady state, but almost all never getting there. And so, in summary, there is a solid mathematical basis to saying that economic behaviour in aggregate is wildly uncertain.</p><p>Before moving on, I just want to mention that Arthur should almost certainly be better known and respected in Bitcoin circles. Readers uninterested in the connection I am proposing between Bitcoin and complex systems (or unimpressed by my amateur passion for both) can skip ahead without missing anything. Arhur’s 2013 paper, Complexity Economics, is an excellent place to start. Likewise, a good argument can be made that complex systems researchers should be a lot more interested in Bitcoin. Readers may well have picked up on the essence of Arthur’s analysis consisting of ‘network effects’. I avoided using the term because Arthur himself doesn’t use it. But he is considered the pioneer of their analysis in economics, and when you think about it, the concept of ‘increasing returns’ makes perfect sense in the context of a network. What greater competitive advantage can you have than everybody needing to use your product simply because enough people already use it? And what product do people need to use solely because others are using it more than ‘money’?</p><p>Although I have eschewed the idea of ‘lock-in’ as helpful for the analysis above, Bitcoin surely has amongst the strongest interdependent network effects of any economic phenomenon in history? Is it not a naturally interdisciplinary complex adaptive system par excellence? Is it not a form of artificial life, coevolved with economising humans in the ecology of the Internet? I mean, for goodness’ sake, Andreas Antonopoulos claims to have put ants on the cover of Mastering Bitcoin because,</p><blockquote>“the highly intelligent and sophisticated behaviour exhibited by a multimillion-member ant colony is an emergent property form the interaction of the individuals in a social network. Nature demonstrates that decentralised systems can be resilient and can produce emergent complexity and incredible sophistication without the need for a central authority, hierarchy, or complex parts.”</blockquote><p>Back in the SFI workshop, Arthur writes,</p><blockquote>“When a nonlinear physical system finds itself occupying a local minimum of a potential function, ‘exit’ to a neighbouring minimum requires sufficient influx of energy to overcome the ‘potential barrier’ that separates the minima. There are parallels to such phase-locking, and to the difficulties of exit, in self-reinforcing economic systems. Self-reinforcement, almost by definition, means that a particular equilibrium is locked in to a degree measurable by the minimum cost to effect changeover to an alternative equilibrium.”</blockquote><p>I’m not sure anybody can sensibly describe what such a ‘minimum cost’ would be. Particularly because Bitcoin is set up in such a way that any move away from lock-in by one metric causes a disproportionate pull back to lock-in by another. It’s Schelling points all the way down.</p><p>Markets Aggregate Prices, Not Information</p><p>The most frustrating thing about the EMH for me is that even the framing is nonsensical. You don’t really need to get into subjective value, uncertainty, complex systems, and so on, to realise that in reading the proposition, prices reflect all available information, you have already been hoodwinked (hoodwunk?). What does ‘reflect’ mean?</p><p>Nic dramatically improved upon this by saying that markets aggregate information. I noticed this is typical of many more enlightened critiques of EMH, and it serves as a far better starting point, in at least suggesting a mechanism by which the mysterious link between information and price might be instantiated. Unfortunately, I think the mechanism suggested is simply invalid. It is not realistic at all and it implicitly encourages a dramatic misunderstanding of what prices really are and where they come from.</p><p>In making sense of this we have to assume some kind of ‘function’ from the space of information to price. I think it’s acceptable to mean this metaphorically, without implying the quasi-metaphysical existence of some such force. We might really mean something like, the market behaves as if operating according to such and such a function. Adam Smith’s ‘invisible hand’ is an instructive comparison. For the time being, I will talk as if some such function ‘exists’.</p><p>We can maybe imagine information as existing as a vector in an incredibly high-dimensional space, at least as compared to price, which is clearly one-dimensional. We could even account for the multitudes of uncertainty we have already learned to accept by suggesting that each individual’s subjective understanding of all the relevant factors and/or ignorance of many of them constitutes a unique mapping of this space to itself, such that the ‘true information vector’ is transformed into something more personal for each market participant. Perhaps individuals then bring this personal information vector to the market, and what the market does is aggregate all the vectors by finding the average. Finally, the market projects this n-dimensional average vector onto the single dimension of price. If you accept the metaphorical nature of all these functions, I can admit this model has some intuitive appeal, in the vein of James Surowiecki’s The Wisdom of Crowds.</p><p>The problem is that this is clearly not how anybody actually interacts with markets. You don’t submit your n-dimensional information/intention-vector; you submit your one-dimensional price. That’s it. The market aggregates these one-dimensional price submissions in real time by matching the flow of marginal bids and asks.</p><p>This understanding gets two birds stoned at once. First, it captures the mechanics of how we know price discovery in markets actually works. There is no mysterious, market-wide canonical projection function — no inexplicable ‘prices reflect information’ — there are just prices, volumes, and the continuous move towards clearing.</p><p>Second, it implies a perfectly satisfactory and not at all mysterious source of the projection of information into price: individuals who make judgments and act. Any supposedly relevant ‘information’ is subject both to opportunity cost and uncertainty. Individuals alone know the importance of their opportunity costs, and individuals alone engage with uncertainty with heuristics, judgment, and staking. If individuals are wrong, they learn. If they are very wrong, they are wiped out. Effective heuristics live to fight another day.</p><p>I am genuinely surprised that this confusion continues to exist in the realm of the EMH, given that, as far as I am concerned, Hayek cleared it up in its entirety in The Use of Knowledge in Society. A superficial reading of Hayek’s ingenious essay might lead one to believe something like prices reflect information. But, to anachronistically borrow our function metaphor once more, Hayek points out that the projection from the n-dimensions of information to the one dimension of price destroys an enormous amount of information. Which is the whole point! Individuals are incapable of understanding the entirety of information in the world. Even the entirety of individuals is incapable of this. Thanks to the existence of markets, nobody has to. They need only know about prices. ‘Perfect information’ is once again shown to be an absurdity. Of the ‘man on the spot’, whom we might hope would make a sensible decision about resource allocation,</p><blockquote>“There is hardly anything that happens anywhere in the world that might not have an effect on the decision he ought to make. But he need not know of these events as such, nor of all their effects. It does not matter for him why at the particular moment more screws of one size than of another are wanted, why paper bags are more readily available than canvas bags, or why skilled labor, or particular machine tools, have for the moment become more difficult to obtain. All that is significant for him is how much more or less difficult to procure they have become compared with other things with which he is also concerned, or how much more or less urgently wanted are the alternative things he produces or uses. It is always a question of the relative importance of the particular things with which he is concerned, and the causes which alter their relative importance are of no interest to him beyond the effect on those concrete things of his own environment.”</blockquote><p>Hayek proposes this be resolved by the price mechanism:</p><blockquote>“Fundamentally, in a system in which the knowledge of the relevant facts is dispersed among many people, prices can act to coordinate the separate actions of different people in the same way as subjective values help the individual to coordinate the parts of his plan.”</blockquote><p>Perhaps ironically, this points to the only sensible way in which markets can be called ‘efficient’. They are efficient with respect to the information they manipulate and convey: as a one-dimensional price, it is the absolute minimum required for participants to interpret and sensibly respond. Markets have excellent social scalability; they are the original distributed systems, around long before anybody thought to coin that expression.</p><p>Interestingly, this meshes very nicely with the complex systems approach to economics associated with Arthur at SFI, and perhaps more specifically with John Holland. His paper at the aforementioned inaugural economics workshop, The Global Economy as an Adaptive Process, at seven pages and zero equations, is well worth a read. Holland recounts many, now familiar, difficulties in mathematical analysis of economics that assume linearity, exclusively negative feedback loops, equilibria, and so on, before proposing that ‘the economy’ is best thought of as what he calls an ‘adaptive nonlinear network’. Its features are worth exploring, even if they require some translation:</p><blockquote>“Each rule in a classifier system is assigned a strength that reflects its usefulness in the context of other active rules. When a rule’s conditions are satisfied, it competes with other satisfied rules for activation. The stronger the rule, the more likely it is to be activated. This procedure assures that a rule’s influence is affected by both its relevance (the satisfied condition) and its confirmation (the strength). Usually many, but not all, of the rules satisfied will be activated. It is in this sense that a rule serves as a hypothesis competing with alternative hypotheses. Because of the competition there are no internal consistency requirements on the system; the system can tolerate a multitude of models with contradictory implications.”</blockquote><p>We could easily translate ‘rule’ as ‘entrepreneurial plan’ or something similar. Entrepreneurial plans can contradict one another, clearly — if they are bidding on the same resources for a novel combination — and can and do compete with one another. Clearly, such plans are hypotheses about the result of an experiment that hasn’t been run yet. Holland then says,</p><blockquote>“A rule’s strength is supposed to reflect the extent to which it has been confirmed as a hypothesis. This, of course, it’s a matter of experience, and subject to revision. In classifier systems, this revision of strength is carried out by the bucket-brigade credit assignment algorithm. Under the bucket-brigade algorithm, a rule actually bids a part of its strength in competing for activation. If the rule wins the competition, it must pay this bid to the rules sending the messages that satisfied its condition (its suppliers). It thus pays for the right to post its message. The rule will regain what it has paid only if there are other rules that in turn bid and pay for its message (its consumers). In effect, each rule is a middleman in a complex economy, and it will only increase its strength if it turns a profit.”</blockquote><p>Much of this does not need translating at all: we see Menger’s higher orders of capital goods, and value of intermediate goods resting ultimately with the subjective value of consumers, who pass information up the chain of production. We see agents that learn from their experience. We see skin-in-the-game of staked capital in ‘bidding part of its strength’ and we see uncertain gain or reward ultimately realised by profit or loss. But most importantly — most Hayekily — we see agents who have no such fiction as ‘perfect information’, but rather responding solely to prices in their immediate environment, and whose reactions affect prices that are passed to other environments. In Complexity, Waldrop quotes Holland’s frustration with the neoclassical obsession with well-defined mathematical problems:</p><blockquote>“‘Evolution doesn’t care whether problems are well-defined or not.’ Adaptative agents are just responding to a reward, he pointed out. They don’t have to make assumptions about where the reward is coming from. In fact, that was the whole point of his classifier systems. Algorithmically speaking, these systems were defined with all the rigor you could ask for. And yet they could operate in an environment that was not well defined at all. Since the classifier rules were only hypotheses about the world, not ‘facts’ they could be mutually contradictory. Moreover, because the system was always testing those hypotheses to find out which ones were useful and led to rewards, it could continue to learn even in the face of crummy, incomplete information — and even while the environment was changing in unexpected ways.</blockquote><blockquote>‘But its behaviour isn’t optimal!’ the economists complain, having convinced themselves that a rational agent is one who optimises his ‘utility function’.</blockquote><blockquote>‘Optimal relative to what?’ Holland replied. Talk about your ill-defined criterion: in any real environment, the space of possibilities is so huge that there is no way an agent can find the optimum — or even recognise it. and that’s before you take into account the fact that the environment might be changing in unforeseen ways.”</blockquote><p>Hayek gives us the intuition of prices conveying only what market participants deem to be the most important information and actually destroying the rest, and Holland shows how this can be represented with the formalism of complex systems. But note that the EMH forces us to imagine that the information is somehow in the market itself. It is honestly unclear to me whether the EMH even allows for honest or ‘rational’ disagreement given it implies that the price is ‘correct’, and all other trading is allegedly ‘noise’. By my account (and Hayek’s) people can clearly disagree. That’s why they trade in the first place; they value the same thing differently. This is not at all mysterious if we realise that engaging with markets requires individuals to ‘project’ the n-dimensions of their information, heuristics, judgments, and stakes onto the single dimension of price, and that markets do not project the aggregates; they aggregate the projections.</p><p>Markets Tend to Leverage Efficiency</p><p>So we know that entrepreneurial efforts will tend towards positive feedback loops if successful, which is a fancy way of saying, they will ‘grow’. And we know that the diversity of compounding uncertainty in markets for securities linked to these efforts will likely generate substantial volatility. But can we say anything more? Can we expect anything more precise?</p><p>It turns out that we can, and here we finally get to Alex Adamou, Ole Peters, and the ergodicity economics research program. It’s about time! The goal of the program is to trace the repercussions of a conceptual and algebraic error regarding the proper treatment of ‘time’ in calculations of ‘expectation value’ that pervaded mainstream economics over the course of the twentieth century. Interested readers are encouraged to visit the program’s website, check out this recent primer in Nature Physics, or just follow Ole and Alex on Twitter, which is where most of the action seems to happen anyway!</p><p>First, a down to earth example. Imagine you want a pair of shoes. You can either go to the same shoe store every day for a month, or you can do to every shoe store in town all in one trip. If it turns out there is no difference between these approaches, this system is ‘ergodic’. If, as seems more likely, there is a difference, the system is ‘non-ergodic’.</p><p>Now with more technical detail, the conceptual and algebraic error is as follows: imagine some variable that changes over time, subject to some well-defined randomness. Now imagine a system of many such variables, whose ‘value’ is just the sum of all the values of the variables. Now imagine you want to find the ‘average’ value of a variable in this system in some pure, undefined sense.</p><p>How do you make sense of an ‘average’ of a system that will be different every time you run it? Well, you could fix the period of time the system runs for, and take the limit of where individual variables get to attained by running the system over and over and over to infinity. Or, you could fix the number of systems (preferably at ‘one’ for minimal confusion) and take the limit of where individual variables get to attained by running the system further and further into the future, to infinity.</p><p>These are called, respectively, the ‘ensemble average’ and the ‘time average’, and are easily remembered as the average achieved by taking x to infinity. ‘Ensemble average’ is commonly known as ‘the expectation’ but Peters and Adamou resist this terminology because it has nothing whatsoever to do with the English word ‘expectation’. You shouldn’t necessarily expect the expectation.</p><p>Now these values might be the same. This means you can measure one of these even if what you really want is the other. If so, your system is called ‘ergodic’. The concept first developed within nineteenth century physics when Ludwig Boltzmann wanted to justify using ensemble averages to model macroscopic quantities such as pressure and temperature in fluids, which are strictly speaking better understood as time averages over bajillions of classically mechanical collisions. If any regular readers of mine exist, they will remember me going through much of this in Cargo Cult Math:</p><p>Cargo Cult Math</p><p>My point that time around was to go on to say that a great deal of financial modelling uses techniques — most notably expectation values — which would only be appropriate if the corresponding observables were ergodic. But they are not. Almost none of them are, to a degree that is both obvious and scary once you grasp it in its totality: clearly the numbers in finance are causally dependent on one another and take place in a world in which time has a direction.</p><p>My point this time around is more cheerful. I want to direct the reader’s attention to another of Peters’ and Adamou’s papers on the topic: Leverage Efficiency (arXiv link here). This subsection is a whistle-stop tour of what that paper says. The usual disclaimer about not doing it justice absolutely applies. The reader is heartily encouraged to read the paper too.</p><p>Imagine a toy model of the price of a stock that obeys geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and with volatility that varies by random draws from a normal distribution. It turns out that the growth rate of the ensemble average price — i.e. the price averaged over all possible parallel systems — is not the same as the time average growth rate of the price — i.e. the growth rate in a single system taken in the long time limit. Clearly what we care about is the time average, as we don’t tend to hold stocks across multiple alternate universes, but rather across time in the actual universe. In particular, in turns out that the ensemble average growth rate is equal to the drift, while the time average growth rate is equal to the drift minus a correction term: the variance over 2.</p><p>This becomes very important when we introduce leverage via a riskless asset an investor can hold short. Let’s call the model drift of the stock minus the stipulated drift of the non-volatile riskless asset ‘the excess growth rate’. Then we can say that the ensemble average growth rate in situations with variable leverage is the growth rate of the riskless asset, plus the leverage multiplied by the excess growth rate. However, the time average has a linked correction, as above. As it is difficult at this point to continue the exposition in English, compare the formulae below:</p>♦<p>The relevance of the difference is that the latter formula is not monotonic in l. In other words, you don’t increase your growth rate unboundedly by leveraging up more and more. This might seem intuitively obvious, and, in fact, the intuition likely strikes in exactly the right spot: in reality there is volatility. The more and more levered you are, the more susceptible you are to total wipeout for smaller and smaller swings. In fact, we can go further and observe that we can therefore maximise the growth rate as a function of leverage, implying an objectively optimal leverage for this toy stock:</p>♦<p>What might this optimal leverage be in practice? Well, Peters and Adamoupropose the tantalising alternative to the EMH: the stochastic markets hypothesis. As opposed to the EMH’s price efficiency, they propose leverage efficiency: it is impossible for a market participant without privileged information to beat the market by applying leverage. In other words, real markets self-organise such that the optimal leverage of 1 is an attractive point for their stochastic properties.</p><p>The paper continues in two directions: firstly, Peters and Adamou propose a theoretical argument for feedback systems that ought to be triggered over long enough periods of the theoretical value of optimal leverage in fact deviating from 1, which all ought to pull it back to 1. I will skip this as it is tangential to the point I am building towards, although obviously very interesting in its own right. Secondly, Peters and Adamou gather data from real markets to establish what the optimal leverage would, in fact, have been. I include some screenshots that strongly suggest this approach is quite fruitful:</p>♦♦This chart probably deserves some explanation, but is very satisfying once grasped: as opposed to just the S&amp;P500, above, both the German equity market (DAX) and Bitcoin show pretty much identical behaviours to the S&amp;P500, which Peters and Adamou term “satisfying leverage efficiency”. That the Madoff curve is so different, and seems to have no clear maximum, indicates it is likely too good to be true. This is a nice result given that we know Madoff’s returns to be fraudulent!<p>However, what I really want to get to in all of this is a specific interpretation of the SMH; that markets self-organise such that optimal leverage tends to 1 in the long run. If we assume that the excess return of the stock price is generated by real economic activity (ultimately, the consistency of the stock’s return on equity) in the long enough run, this would seem to suggest that a certain amount of volatility is actually natural. Were a stock to consistently generate an excess return above that of the riskless asset, investors would lever up to purchase it. This mass act would (reflexively!) cause its volatility to shoot up as the price shoots up, and in the inevitable case of a margin call on these levered investors, volatility would increase further as the stock price comes back down.</p><p>This is a somewhat naïve explanation, but the gist is that the lack of volatility in the short run will tend to generate excess volatility in the medium run, such that a natural level is tended to in the long run. Or, markets are stochastically efficient. Readers familiar with the unsuspecting role that ‘portfolio insurance’ turned out to have played in 1987’s Black Monday — the single biggest daily stock market drop in modern history that seemed to follow no negative news whatsoever — will find all this eerily familiar. Taleb calls Black Monday a prototypical Black Swan that shaped his formative years as a Wall Street trader. Mandelbrot cites it as sure-fire evidence of power laws and wild randomness in financial markets. It ties together many themes of this essay because, evidently, the information was not in any of the prices. Not in the slightest. I leave it to the reader to mull over what all this implies if interventions in financial markets are targeted solely at reducing volatility as a worthwhile end in itself, the rationale of which makes no mention of growth or leverage. Once again, search for “Raghuram Rajan Jackson Hole” or read about the so-called Great Moderation if unsure where to start. Volatility signals stability, in financial markets and likely well beyond …</p><p>All this has a final interesting implication that I teased earlier: the resolution of the so-called ‘equity premium puzzle’; that, according to such-and-such behavioural models from the psychological literature, the excess return of equities ‘should be’ much lower than it really is. Cue the behavioural economists claims of irrational risk aversion, blah blah blah. Peters and Adamou provide an alternative with no reference to human behaviour at all. The difference between the growth rates of the risky (l=1) and riskless (l=0) assets is the excess return minus the volatility correction. If markets are attracted to the point at which leverage efficiency equals 1, then it follows by substituting the definition of the equity risk premium in terms of risky and riskless assets into the equation defining optimal leverage, that the equity premium ought to be attracted to the excess return over 2. Peters and Adamou delightfully write, “our analysis reveals this to be a very accurate prediction … we regard the consistency of the observed equity premium with the leverage efficiency hypothesis to be a resolution of the equity premium puzzle.” QED.</p><p>I’ll note before wrapping up this sub-section that any readers triggered by such terms as geometric Brownian motion and normal distributions needn’t be. Peters and Adamou acknowledge that GBM is not realistically either necessary or sufficient as a mechanism for stock price movements. But their argument really only depends on the characteristics of an upward drift and random volatility, both of which are reasonable to expect. They choose GBM because it is simple to handle, well understood, and prevalent in the literature they criticise, but they also write that,</p><blockquote>“for any time-window that includes both positive and negative daily excess returns, regardless of their distribution, a well-defined optimal constant leverage exists in our computations …</blockquote><blockquote>Stability arguments, which do not depend on the specific distribution of returns and go beyond the model of geometric Brownian motion, led us to the quantitative prediction that on sufficiently long time scales real optimal leverage is attracted to 0 ≤ lopt ≤ 1 (or, in the strong form of our hypothesis, to l-opt =1).”</blockquote><p>We knew from previous sections that volatility is likely. It will exist to some extent due to the teased-out implications of subjective values and omnipresent uncertainty. But now we know that it is necessary. It is not noise, irrationality, panic, etc, around a correct price. It is, at least in part, inevitable reflexive rebalancing of leverage around whatever the price happens to be.</p><p>Incompleteness</p><p>You can’t write ten thousand words on mathematical formalisms outlining the limits of human knowledge without mentioning Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems.</p><p>Adaptation and Fractals</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, of all the dissenting work on the EMH, I most recommend, by far, Andrew Lo’s Adaptive Markets Hypothesis — the original paper and the follow-up book- and the various thoughts of Benoit Mandelbrot on fractals in financial markets — strewn across numerous academic papers, but lucidly conveyed in the popular book, The (Mis)behaviour of Markets. I assume familiarity with these works to avoid explaining everything from scratch, so if the reader is unfamiliar, I encourage jumping ahead to the next section.</p><p>My main critique of Lo is that he doesn’t take uncertainty seriously enough. In covering the academic history surrounding the EMH, he only gives Simon a page or so, and Gigerenzer a paragraph. The key point of failure, in my view, is his treatment of the Ellsberg paradox. Or rather, the fact that he stops his rigorous discussion of uncertainty at this point.</p><p>The problem here is that the uncertainty in the Ellsberg paradox is confined to the odds, whereas we know from the previous discussion that the uncertainty in economics exists in the outcomes. This means that the odds aren’t just uncertain, they are non-existent. By stopping here, Lo passes off the results of running the experiment that gives rise to the so-called paradox as simply indicating ambiguity aversion, which he presents as a kind of irrational bias — then a segue to behavioural economics. This prevents Lo from exploring the implications of Knightian uncertainty on entrepreneurship and competition, and ultimately gives him little ammunition to take on the EMH directly. In fact, he acknowledges that he never really does — he just proposes something he thinks is better.</p><p>That said, I agree that his model is better. Far better! Adaptation is a fascinating concept to employ here. As noted several times, it comes through very naturally in the complex systems approach. I won’t comment on it too much as its roots in evolutionary biology are outside my academic pedigree. But the basic intuition of changing circumstances and responding agents I find rather compelling. As do, it would seem, several thinkers I have already cited. Consider this passage from Kirzner,</p><blockquote>“it is necessary to introduce the insight that men learn from their experiences in the market. It is necessary to postulate that out of the mistakes which led market participants to choose less-than-optimal courses of action yesterday, there can be expected to develop systematic changes in expectations concerning ends and means that can generate corresponding alterations in plans.”</blockquote><p>Also, there is a tradition of referring to heuristics as ecologically rational, and the biological analogy is no coincidence. This passage from Waldrop’s Complexity on John Holland’s conversion to complex systems thinking in his study of genetics is striking in the almost simple obviousness of the comparison drawn to economics (again, not at all a coincidence):</p><blockquote>“it bothered Holland that [R.A.] Fisher kept talking about evolution achieving a stable equilibrium — that state in which a given species has attained its optimum size, its optimum sharpness of tooth, its optimum fitness to survive and reproduce. Fisher’s argument was essentially the same one that economist use to define economic equilibrium: once a species’ fitness is at a maximum, he said, any mutation will lower the fitness … but that did not sound like evolution to me.</blockquote><blockquote>… to Holland, evolution and learning seemed much more like — well, a game. In both cases, trying to win enough of what it needed to keep going. In evolution that payoff is literally survival, and a chance for the agent to pass its genes on to the next generation. In learning, the payoff is a reward of some kind, such as food, a pleasant sensation, or emotional fulfilment, but either way, the payoff (or lack of it) gives agents the feedback they need to improve their performance: if they’re going to be ‘adaptive’ at all, they somehow have to keep the strategies that pay off well, and let the others die out.”</blockquote><p>One thing I especially like about Lo’s approach is his idea of ‘evolution at the speed of thought’, often rhetorical as much as anything else. I think this provides a useful conceptual tool to deal with what I deemed to be the only consistent deficiency in the material I covered on complex systems: Arthur, Holland, et al, seem to me so focused on the comparison to biological evolution, and on shifting the comparative conceptual framework from physics to biology as a whole, that they forget the role of purposeful human beings in all of this. Economic ‘mutation’ is not random, it is creative, intuitive, judgmental. It happens at the speed of thought because humans think on purpose. They do not cycle through the space of every thought that can possibly be had until they hit on one that happens to be a business plan.</p><p>To put this in a wider context and loop back to previously cited thinkers, I think Arthur is best read alongside Kirzner, and indeed Kirzner is best read alongside Arthur. Particularly in The Nature of Technology, which is otherwise an excellent book, Arthur perfectly grasps how change happens, but not why. In Competition and Entrepreneurship, Kirzner perfectly grasps why change happens, but not how. Both the why and the how rely, in part, on understanding economic evolution as an essentially human phenomenon, because genes mutate, but humans think.</p><p>Mandelbrot’s ideas on fractals in finance are iconoclastic, to say the least. Unlike Lo, I see nothing to disagree with, and much that probably went over my head. But given Mandelbrot sets himself the task of demolishing the EMH out of left field, and seemingly succeeds, it is definitely worth grappling with.</p><p>The mildly boring part of The (Mis)behaviour of Markets is Mandelbrot showing that, empirically, financial data does not seem to fit the Brownian motion of the random walk hypothesis, and hence the EMH. The really juicy part is his explanation of why. To avoid getting into any really tricky mathematics and essentially rewriting his book, I will summarise his argument, again not doing it justice, as, this isn’t random enough. More suggestively, it is too predictably random.</p><p>Mandelbrot thinks that prices in financial markets are, up to a certain granularity, fractals. If true, this has many fascinating implications, but the most relevant here is that the self-similarity this implies means that any randomness in their fluctuation must be irregular. It should not be possible to ascertain any regularity just by changing the timespan because they look the same on every timespan (look! there’s ‘time’ again!) The randomness must itself be pretty random. And that randomness must be random, and so on. There are no genuinely normal distributions in finance, Mandelbrot believes, but rather they all tend towards Cauchy. We could be less hand-wavy about all this and point out instead that while a statistical test on some financial data might suggest the tail of a lognormal distribution, we are really looking at a power law. If parameterized to induce fat enough tails, such a distribution may not have a variance, and if fat enough, not even a mean. (And no, it doesn’t have an ‘infinite variance’ or ‘infinite mean’ because that is meaningless, but nice try). As Taleb and Mandelbrot both wrote in Fortune,</p><blockquote>“In bell-curve finance, the chance of big drops is vanishingly small and is thus ignored. The 1987 stock market crash was, according to such models, something that could happen only once in several billion billion years.”</blockquote><p>Black swans, amiright?</p><p>What does this have to do with ‘complex’ markets? Mandelbrot doesn’t explore this idea, and I may be going out on a limb here, but I think this is almost exactly what you would expect if you thought markets were maximally uncertain, so to speak. If risk were predictable, then it could be hedged against. If it were unpredictable in and of itself, but were distributed predictably, then that could be hedged against. And so on and so forth. This all lends itself to a hand-wavy inductive proof by contradiction. We know that nothing can be perfectly hedged because it derives from uncertainty, and uncertainty on uncertainty, and uncertainty on that uncertainty, and so on. Financial markets can shift uncertainty around, and selectively parcel it into more and less risky instruments, but uncertainty itself cannot be removed.</p><p>Bitcoin</p><p>Oh goodness, I guess I have to say something about Bitcoin now, lest I be accused of rickrolling an angry twitter mob into a sermon on armchair economics. Is the halving priced in?</p><p>I have no idea. Which is sort of the moral of all of this. You can’t predict the uncertain future, but you can bet on it. I’m not sure how you would bet on this exact hypothesis: perhaps a combination of options that pay off if and only if the price goes up (or doesn’t go up) by whatever the stock-to-flow model predicts, within some bounds, when it predicts it, within some bounds? Obviously, you could just be long Bitcoin, but then you aren’t isolating the essence of this claim, and you can benefit for all sorts of other reasons. If you do either, you’ll move the price towards the outcome you are hoping for. But only by having put skin in the game. Also, you could believe something very specific about the halving, but have no way of testing it as you don’t believe in stock-to-flow models, or any other valuation model, for that matter. That’s the essence of my noncommittal answer above: I shouldn’t tell you what I think, I should show you my portfolio, right? Well, I have no ‘halving bet’ in my portfolio, so I guess I think nothing. Which is what I said :)</p><p>Even so, we can still make a few interesting observations that draw on the above discussion. Clearly, the question relies on reflexivity, which is interesting in and of itself. It’s only derivatively a question about the fundamentals, and more about the extent to which the market is a well-oiled beauty contest. I don’t think I know enough about the actual workings of the Bitcoin market to comment on this. It strikes me that, relative to global equities markets, at least, the range of heuristics that market participants in Bitcoin are using vary wildly from one another. If it makes any sense to say so, they likely have pretty dramatic variance. At the same time, the market itself is probably highly illiquid, relative to what we might be used to. This might suggest the halving isn’t priced in, in the sense that the change in marginal bids and asks at which the market clears that we know is going to happen dwarfs the capital that is already deployed, including towards solely this essentially reflexive bet. But then again, maybe it doesn’t.</p><p>Honestly, I just don’t know. And if somebody does claim to know, tell them to show you their portfolio.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Value is subjective, which means uncertainty governs all economic phenomena. This creates a complexity that resists equilibria and is constantly changing besides. Within such a system, prices convey the minimal possible information necessary for economic agents to purposefully react. They do so with judgment and heuristics, not ‘perfect information’, which is nonsensical, as is ‘perfect competition’ and ‘rational expectations’. Prices may pass statistical tests for randomness, but they are not themselves random (although it is plausible that their randomness is random, and that randomness is random, and so on) but rather are unpredictable on the basis of market data alone. They are, however, predictable to the extent that the predictor accurately assesses the future subjective valuations both of economic agents and fellow market participants, and backs up this prediction with staked capital. This act of staking changes the uncertainties at play, rendering any attempt at genuinely scientific analysis futile. You can beat the market, it’s just really hard, and it depends on understanding people, not data. And it’s meaningless if you do it in theory but not practice.</p><p>Markets have many characteristics. I suggest they are subjective, uncertain, complex, stochastic, adaptive, fractal, reflexive … — really any clever sounding adjective you like — just not efficient.</p><p>Thanks to Nic Carter, Robert Natzler, Alex Adamou, and Sacha Meyers, for edits and contributions.</p><p>follow me on Twitter @allenf32 and feel free to contribute to the Allen ideas fund: bc1q8utvneuvn3hf2lm5nvt3dreqenad6hh5sda2sa</p>♦

  ♦Photo by Taylor Vick on Unsplash<p>With the notion of Bitcoin as a security dispelled, including by American regulators themselves, the other common ways people attempt to wedge Bitcoin into legacy frameworks — and regulation — is as either a commodity, property, or the ultimate goal: money.</p><p>But Bitcoin is at odds with these concepts at a fundamental level. Because “bitcoins” don’t exist.</p><p>As Beautyon has popularized in his case that Bitcoin is speech protected by the first amendment, the definition of Bitcoin can be simplified to a distributed internet protocol that relays text messages between voluntary/free participants.</p>That’s all Bitcoin is — a means of communication.<p>The unique value proposition of the Bitcoin communication protocol is that these messages can be used by participants to communicate an interpretation of value. How this works is through a mechanism called the “unspent transaction output” (UTXO). UTXOs can be a little difficult to understand, but Investopedia describes it well:</p><p>“UTXO stands for the unspent output from bitcoin transactions. Each bitcoin transaction begins with coins used to balance the ledger. UTXOs are processed continuously and are responsible for beginning and ending each transaction. Confirmation of transaction results in the removal of spent coins from the UTXO database. But a record of the spent coins still exists on the ledger.”</p>♦Bitcoin is a means of communication<p>It’s these UTXOs that are measured in a unit called “bitcoin”, but this is more akin to measuring how space is used on a hard drive than bars of gold in a vault. UTXOs are just the occupants of Bitcoin’s information space.</p><p>One of Bitcoin’s utilities is popularly described as “digital gold” because this information space comes in a limited quantity. The network-wide UTXO balance will only add up to a certain scarce amount with the current outstanding supply summing to 18.2M BTC out of the 21M BTC hard cap it will reach sometime next century. But this analogy — Bitcoin as digital gold — is not the actual definition of Bitcoin, only one subjective interpretation.</p>What controls these UTXOs?<p>Bitcoin private keys are another type of Bitcoin information. Through cryptographic processes outside the scope of this article, private keys can derive a corresponding public key that acts as an address for receiving UTXOs. The private key then exercises control over all the UTXOs it has received. UTXOs are transferred as inputs in messages when they are cryptographically signed by the private key with authority to do so.</p>♦Private keys exert control over Bitcoin’s information spaceEnergy, Value and Settlement Assurances<p>Another viewpoint commonly employed to explain Bitcoin is to say that it is “backed by energy”.</p><p>The reason why is that roughly every ten minutes, blocks of Bitcoin “messages” are confirmed by competing computers (“miners”) employing a huge amount of energy to meet the rules set out by the protocol. These ten-minute blocks are Bitcoin’s bandwidth. Only a certain amount of Bitcoin “messages” can be transmitted in each block, called the block-weight. Taken together, this process of adding message blocks to increment the “block height” by miners is called proof-of-work, and to simplify it gives the Bitcoin network some important features:</p><ul><li>The rules the miners follow to update the distributed network state require that UTXOs must be unspent (as the name suggests). This solves the so-called “double-spend” problem in the digital world where information had previously always been non-scarce. What value would a UTXO accrue if a user could reuse it? It means that absolute mathematical scarcity now exists for the first time, a discovery that can’t be achieved again.</li><li>These value-transfer messages are then effectively buried under each new block of messages: to undo them, an attacker would need to prove the same amount of work to the protocol as has been applied to each successive block — and from all the competing computers, not just the successful ones. This is a proxy for energy and means that expended energy is a key requirement to ensure transaction finality, or settlement assurances, as Nic Carter writes. It is a security feature that to attack Bitcoin, inordinate amounts of energy must be employed.</li><li>The competition between miners, resulting in a distributed ledger that they all contribute to, means that this global value-transfer network does not rely on any trusted third party. Clearance and settlement happen according to strict rules on the Bitcoin protocol that tens of thousands of independent users verify for themselves.</li></ul><p>Because expended energy is so core to Bitcoin’s security and viability, the concept that “Bitcoin is backed by energy” has emerged as a useful concept for understanding why this communication protocol works at all. Taken to its literal conclusion, this line of thought has led some to argue that this energy creates Bitcoin’s value and that Bitcoin is therefore a commodity — captured energy.</p><p>Rather, it is the energy expended for security in combination with Bitcoin’s use of information space that is why the network accrues value. Put another way, if the information space occupied by Bitcoin UTXOs could be classified as a commodity, then space rented on Amazon’s AWS servers would also be a commodity. Like the Bitcoin network, AWS relies on expending a lot of energy to function, and the computing resources rented by businesses and individuals represent information space in the virtual world. But it would be absurd to classify AWS as a commodity, and so it is with Bitcoin.</p><p>Indeed, it’s the separation of value from commodities that makes the Bitcoin communication protocol so uniquely valuable. As Conner Brown has written, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value as a commodity — an observation often used as a criticism — but that is a feature, not a bug. A commodity-based value transfer system, such as the gold standard, not only finds its value subject to the market fluctuations caused by changes in supply and industrial demand, but it also inflates the price of the underlying commodity by increasing its demand. This monetary premium means that a commodity like gold is much more expensive than it otherwise would be, and this distortion in the price signal hampers its use in goods such as cheaper electronics.</p>The Most Tradable Information<p>Without needing to grasp for financial definitions, commerce enabled by the Bitcoin value-transfer protocol will still be commercial activity. If the distributed Bitcoin ledger helps to conduct commercial activity between a shop and a consumer, that shop is still going to file a tax return with profit based on the fiat value of goods sold.</p><p>Monetary systems are savings technologies that ultimately serve to transfer value in time and space, a tool for the farmer selling his year’s output in Fall to be able to purchase new shoes six months later when he has nothing to sell. Having lacked a logical system to keep track of everyone’s market contributions until now, this value transfer role has traditionally fallen to the economy’s “most tradable good” — typically something exhibiting beneficial properties such as durability, portability, divisibility, and hardness (hard to produce more of it and debase it).</p><p>Monetary theorists such as Carl Menger, Nick Szabo and Saifedean Ammous argue that the emergence of a new money has historically gone through various stages. Starting as either a collectible (such as shells or family heirlooms) or a commodity (flint blades or gold), a monetary good first accrues value in the subjective eyes of an increasing number of people. Given enough time, this accrued value gains permanence, allowing the good to successively function as a store of value then as a medium of exchange when it reaches a certain level of liquidity and price equilibrium.</p><p>Similarly, Bitcoin’s communication protocol and scarce information space have piqued the interest of human minds such that their uses and perceptions of it have gone through evolving narratives and led many to collect the scarcity of the information space into UTXOs only they have the authority to spend. These narratives have ranged from a crypto-anarchist collectible and “private” darknet currency, to current interpretations such as “digital gold”. But just as price is an interpretation of value, these human narratives — Bitcoin as gold, Bitcoin as commodity — are an interpretation of the fundamental nature of Bitcoin: information.</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>Now that we are all Bitcoin Maximalists, we need to take it to the next step and get rid of the confusion surrounding the monetary evolution of Bitcoin:</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@MustStopMurad</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>If something becomes the most tradable good, it can function as money. Bitcoin is text, but its properties might allow it to fulfill a monetary role for those demanding scarce information space in the form of UTXOs. We can’t say exactly where Bitcoin might be on its way to being used as a monetary system — that’s for each individual market participant to decide for themselves — but early adopters are using it in that role already. With Bitcoin’s help, the economy might just become a little more like entering a global barter system — a ledger system to keep track of everyone’s market contributions. Rather than being the world’s most tradable good, Bitcoin is the world’s most tradable information.</p><p>So, what of the other aspects of financialization? One of Trace Mayer’s seven anticipated network effects of Bitcoin, it is becoming apparent that because Bitcoin’s information space has accrued value, it can be used as the base value of financial instruments built around it. Control of UTXOs is being transferred as collateral against lines of credit, and Bitcoin key storage providers like KNØX are attaining insurance policies for the fiat value of the information space they guard. Even futures markets are being built, enabling participants to hedge and bet on fluctuations in the accrued value and energy costs of the network. These instruments — insurance, credit, futures — appear to be financial products. But again, the way the communication protocol is used does not define Bitcoin. An orange is an orange, but that doesn’t stop the market trading on its future value from dealing in derivatives to hedge risk against orange production rate fluctuations.</p><p>Similarly, the properties of Bitcoin’s communication protocol present opportunities to natively automate tasks with parallels to traditional financial services, but that doesn’t make Bitcoin a financial service. For example, Bitcoin allows for unique audit solutions without the use of a third party audit. As an open communication protocol, the value transferred in each message is visible to all participants, meaning that scripts can be written to prove that a participant possesses the keys exerting control over particular UTXOs. This idea — that a custodian can demonstrate “proof of reserves” — is yet to gain wide adoption, but it has drawn much anticipation and demonstrates the power arising from Bitcoin’s nature as a pure communication protocol.</p><p>Because Bitcoin is text, it fundamentally sits outside of existing financial definitions and regulations. But that doesn’t preclude its information space from exhibiting monetary characteristics. In fact, it’s in part because of all of this that Bitcoin is so valuable. And things that are valuable need to be protected.</p>How to Keep a Secret<p>At the protocol level, the nature of Bitcoin’s information space means that private keys function like a digital bearer instrument: there is no inherent difference between possession, control and ownership.</p><p>Remember there are no bitcoins per se; there are private keys that permit spending UTXOs via signed messages on the network. Bitcoin private keys are also information. You can write them down, speak them, print them, memorize them in your head. Thousands of people can hold the exact same key; if you have Andreas Antonopoulos’ Mastering Bitcoin on your shelf then you share several Bitcoin private keys printed in its pages with all the other thousands of people who have access to it. By US constitutional law, this means that creating, spending, or otherwise using Bitcoin private keys constitutes speech protected by the first amendment. But unlike the scarce information space occupied by UTXOs, when it comes to Bitcoin private keys we are dealing with non-scarce information.</p><p>Obviously, since Bitcoin’s information space has accrued value, it is in the best interest of those who exercise control over a portion of it to keep the private key out of others’ hands. To exercise exclusive control over replicable information requires competence at protecting a secret.</p><p>If the Bitcoin carnivores will excuse a fast food analogy, this is why KFC doesn’t have a patent on its 11 secret herbs and spices, information that has accrued such value it contributed to the growth of a global fried chicken empire. Rather, they have a vault at their headquarters that very select individuals can access, inside of which is the only known certified copy of the recipe. They even have their own multisignature scheme, with two companies each responsible for supplying half of the ingredients.</p><p>This demonstrates the “not your keys, not your coins (UTXOs)” meme. Possession of the secret enables the bearer to exercise control over the valuable information space; at the protocol level, possession, control and ownership can not be separated. As Daskalov, CEO of KNØX, put it, “the Bitcoin protocol is necessarily amoral, governed by an uncompromising set of rules.”</p><p>This is creating demand for an optional Bitcoin key storage layer that might allow businesses to delegate possession to a trusted key storage provider while maintaining unquestionable ownership in the legal sense, and control in the technical sense. Such is the burden of holding these secrets that exercising control over private key information is more a liability than an asset. Most companies holding Bitcoin keys are required to do so out of operational necessity but would rather offload that liability from their books, as they do not monetize it.</p><p>Private key storage is more like managing a password than anything else. When a hard drive is locked by ransomware, most people without an adequate backup are likely to pony up the ransom to retrieve access to their information. This digital information is not property in the legal sense, but it’s certainly valuable to the individual who previously exercised possession and control over it.</p>Storing Bitcoin Keys Responsibly<p>Bitcoin is just information, so it is difficult to place it inside existing financial definitions and regulations. But with its information space being the first example of truly scarce information, it has accrued substantial value thanks to evolving narratives.</p><p>If you want to learn about responsible Bitcoin private key custody for your fund, exchange, or other vehicles, have strict LP and risk management requirements, or otherwise appreciate a trust-minimized profile, we’d love to talk.</p><p>Please email us at custody@kn0x.io</p><p>Under no circumstances should any material on this post be construed as an offering of securities or investment advice.

  Assessing Bitcoin’s True Transfer Volume♦<p>Even though blockchain data is publicly accessible, it is a non-trivial challenge to make sense of it in a meaningful way.</p><p>On-chain data is without a doubt highly valuable — but in its raw form it’s just not good enough.</p><p>It contains a substantial amount of noise, and careful preprocessing and contextualisation is required in order to distil useful information from it.</p><p>Consider on-chain transaction volume: Figure 1 shows Bitcoin’s raw daily on-chain transaction volume (USD value) for 2019.</p>♦<p>On August 21st an enormous spike occurred, leading to a recorded on-chain volume of over $250 billion USD in a single day.</p><p>Without context, this might seem like a significant event.</p><p>However, this volume was simply caused by Bitcoin “change”, associated to a crypto exchange creating new cold wallets and reshuffling their funds internally — no actual Bitcoins were transferred between different participants in the network.</p><p>Therefore, if we are interested in assessing the value of bitcoin that is actually being transferred across different holders, proper processing and sophisticated methods need to be applied to the raw blockchain data.</p>Change-Adjusted Volume<p>Adjusting for (obvious) change is a commonly applied heuristic to obtain a more accurate measure for on-chain volume.</p><p>This adjustment is applicable to transactions in which the sending address is present in both the inputs and the outputs of the transaction, i.e. a transaction output returns Satoshis back to an address of the sender (see Figure 2 for an example).</p>♦<p>The change is considered “obvious” because the sender is re-using an existing sending address within the same transaction to receive the bitcoin change in return.</p><p>Figure 3 shows the daily change-adjusted on-chain volume for 2019.</p>♦<p>Note how the volume spike vanishes, and in addition change-adjusted volume is consistently lower compared to the raw volume.</p><p>In fact, within the denoted time period above, the daily change-adjusted volume is, on average, 43% lower.</p><blockquote>A live chart comparing raw and change-adjusted Bitcoin volume can be found on Glassnode Studio here.</blockquote>Beyond Change: Adjusting by Entities<p>The problem with the above heuristic is that it doesn’t go far enough. There are other cases in which on-chain bitcoin volume does not represent actual transfer of Bitcoin between different holders.</p><p>For one, a single user can send bitcoin between different addresses that he/she controls. Furthermore, many wallets nowadays send change back to the spender using newly created addresses instead of re-using an existing one.</p><p>At Glassnode we use more advanced techniques and heuristics in order to estimate an upper bound for the “true” on-chain volume of Bitcoin — volume that actually changes hands.</p><p>To do so, we employ what we coin entity-adjustment and refine this methodology by accounting for so-called relay addresses as well.</p>Entity-Adjustment<p>In our previous article we introduced the concept of “entities” in the Bitcoin network: Clusters of addresses that are controlled by the same entity.</p><p>Entity-adjustment therefore makes use of this knowledge and discards volume moved between addresses that belong to the same entity cluster (“in-house volume”). This is volume that does not represent value transferred between distinct users in the network. Because one address belongs to a single entity, this adjustment entails, by definition, the aforementioned change-adjustment as well. ( Note: We ignore multisig addresses in this analysis).</p>♦<p>Consider the example transaction in Figure 2 above: While it contains obvious change, our algorithms actually detect that all input and output addresses are controlled by the same entity — therefore the whole transaction does not contribute to the true BTC transfer volume at all.</p><p>Moreover, this implies that this transaction is discarded in the computation of entity-adjusted transaction counts, since it is a transaction that only transfers BTC internally.</p>Relay-Adjustment<p>In addition to adjusting for entities, we take into account so-called “relay addresses” as well. Relay addresses are addresses whose sole purpose is to forward (relay) funds to a subsequent address. Hence, the volume of relay addresses is usually double-counted: once moving into and once moving out of the relay address.</p><p>Through the identification of addresses with this behaviour, we are able to remove this added of noise in volume aggregates. To do so, we discard all outputs that are spent by relay addresses.</p>♦<p>Technically, we define relay addresses as addresses whose mean spent output lifespan is less than 1 hour, and whose current balance is zero (excluding UTXOs which were created within the last hour).</p><p>Figures 6–8 show the difference between between our entity-adjusted volume (incl. relay-adjustment), change-adjusted volume, and raw volume for the the years 2016, 2017–2018, and 2019, respectively.</p>♦♦♦<p>The results speak for themselves, and the differences are compelling.</p><p>The 2016 data illustrates the removal of significant volume spikes that are not accounted for by change-adjusted volume only. Similarly, volume during the bull market in 2017 shows substantial discrepancies (5x) between entity-adjusted and raw/change-adjusted Bitcoin volume.</p><p>Over the period from 2016–2019 the daily on-chain transaction volume using our entity-adjusted methodology has been</p><ul><li>75.5% lower than the raw volume and</li><li>63% lower than change-adjusted volume.</li></ul><p>This means that less than 25% of Bitcoin volume that is recorded on-chain represents actual value transfers between network participants.</p><blockquote>Our entity-adjusted metrics show that the true Bitcoin on-chain volume is on average only 25% of the raw volume recorded on the blockchain.</blockquote><p>For a complete picture, Figure 9 shows the ratio between raw volume and entity-adjusted (as well as change-adjusted) over time. The entity-adjusted ratio has been relatively stable fluctuating around 0.25 since 2016.</p>♦<p>Figure 10 depicts the monthly difference between raw and entity-adjusted (as well as change-adjusted) volume in USD. It shows that on a monthly basis our entity-adjusted volume is up to a compelling $875 billion and $629 billion lower compared to the raw volume and the change-adjusted volume, respectively.</p>♦Conclusion<p>The data and analyses presented here are in no way intended to lessen Bitcoin’s value proposition and should not be interpreted as such.</p><p>The purpose of this work is merely to signify that advanced methods are required to meaningfully make sense of on-chain data. In order to accurately understand the underlying state of the Bitcoin network and its events it is essential to contextualise and scrutinize this data properly.</p><p>Note the in the present work we exclusively refer to bitcoin moved on the blockchain. We don’t account for BTC that is bought or sold on exchanges. Technically, on a network level, those bitcoin are still controlled by the same entity — the exchange itself.</p><p>In Bitcoin’s economy the implications of moving funds within the same entity, and actually transferring ownership of bitcoin (and therefore value) across network participants, are very different — they represent very different things in terms of economic activity.</p><p>Any investor, trader, and researcher aiming to properly understand value and wealth transfers in Bitcoin’s economy should be undoubtedly making use of these fundamental differences drawn from on-chain volume.</p><p>All metrics presented in this work are live on Glassnode Studio as of today:</p><ul><li>Entity–adjusted Volume (Total)</li><li>Entity–adjusted Volume (Mean)</li><li>Entity–adjusted Volume (Median)</li><li>Entity–adjusted Transaction Count</li></ul><p>For change–adjusted volume visit:</p><ul><li>Change–adjusted Volume (Total)</li><li>Change–adjusted Volume (Mean)</li><li>Change–adjusted Volume (Median)</li></ul>♦<p>Disclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

  ♦<p>Melanie Dawes’ position and newly published plans for regulating encryption at the behest of the “Five Eyes” are misguided and betray a fundamentally computer illiterate approach. She is ignorant of the history of computing and encryption, and her plans will damage Britain. It is a lie to claim people are put at risk by encryption; the complete opposite is true.</p>The Background and Facts<p>Melanie Dawes (ex permanent secretary at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government), like all politicians, knows next to nothing about computers and software. In her busy world, computers are the tools of secretaries and assistants, and not something she has a particular interest in.</p><p>Professionals in the Security Services on the other hand do understand computers, and are asking for software to be crippled so that no communication can be transmitted in private. They know the complete history of encryption, and how previous attempts to have it outlawed or weakened have failed. They are hijacking the mass hysteria over terrorism to make a fresh attempt to take encryption away from the public.</p><p>The Electronic Communications Act 2000 in the UK was an early attempt to make it illegal to sell a software product that did not have a back door for government access. It was defeated and removed from the statutes.</p><p>In the USA, several attempts have been made to mandate government access to all private communications; some via new hardware devices like the Clipper Chip, and others through setting legal precedent. They also tried to chill the release of encryption tools by the three year harassment of Phillip Zimmerman, the author of “Pretty Good Privacy”, the tool that Edward Snowden has admitted that the NSA and GCHQ cannot break.</p><p>Even today, any encryption system with key lengths longer than 64bits must be approved by the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security before they can be exported. This is patently absurd, since key lengths of 4095bits are available to everyone globally without restriction, and all SSL is 128bits by default at a minimum world-wide.</p>The Current Situation<p>Today, Apple and Google with their iOS and Android operating systems have rolled out full device encryption so that no one can read the contents of a user’s phone. This was done in direct response to the NSA’s mass intrusion into the communications and devices of millions of innocent people.</p><p>Now Melanie Dawes, under pressure from surveillance “professionals” in “The Five Eyes” who are exploiting her computer illiteracy, are trying once again to revive their decades old attempts to cripple the public’s access to encryption and privacy. They failed in the late 1990s and they will fail again, because the iPhone saturated, “selfie” taking WhatsApp world is a very different place today.</p><p>Everyone uses encryption, whether they know it or not, on a daily basis. All eCommerce depends on it. If the UK Parliament makes it law that all encryption must have a back door, then criminals will have default access to all websites that sell anything, together with easy access to the personal information of billions of net users on all devices. Her demands are unworkable and ineffective because different jurisdictions will not follow her, and any software developer in the world can use both the old and new absolutely reliable tools to have secure chat and email and file storage, or simply move their services to a free jurisdiction, avoiding the anti-tech British laws.</p><p>Furthermore, it is now demonstrated that if exploits to break into people’s phones are developed, they absolutely will escape control of the State and be used by bad actors on a global scale. We now know that this has actually happened in real life, thanks to Wikileaks. Asking WhatsApp and apple to build back doors into their apps is a recipe for disaster globally at worst, and it means Britain being cut off from WhatsApp and other apps at best.</p><p>Dawes can demand that encryption has back doors in Britain, but she cannot demand that Americans or anyone else follow her. This would mean that only British web sites and services are vulnerable; the entire British internet would be globally recognised as an unsafe zone for e-commerce. It would be a disaster for the tech sector of the UK that the government is so keen to promote.</p>Mixed Messages<p>The messages coming out of the government are not coherent, and its clear that Melanie Dawes is nothing more than the unhappy latest messenger. On the one hand, her government wants “Silicon Roundabout” to be the centre of the tech explosion in Europe, but on the other hand, they are being told to cripple the key tool used in making that tech work. Clearly, this is the sound of two voices at odds with each other.</p>♦<p>Silicon Roundabout in North London. The centre of the UK’s “Tech City”.</p><p>And its not only eCommerce that is threatened by the UK’s anti progress stance. There is a vast movement online to put all internet services no matter what they are behind HTTPS by default. Mandating that the government has backdoor access to every website accessed from Britain is literally impossible. It means fundamentally re-engineering the entire web, and no one is going to agree to this. If you access an American email service from the UK, like Gmail, the SSL will not be back doored, and the communications will be private. In the reverse direction, they will not be private. This means that no company will host their email services in the UK, and the money, brains and tech will flow outwards, away from the UK. This will be called “The Tech Drain”.</p><p>Now that the world depends on encryption for the movement of all of the money in circulation globally, it is not possible to weaken the tools that protect the movement of that money without destroying commerce itself. You cannot weaken the tools that protect everyone without giving blanket access to criminals. Melanie Dawes has been badly briefed, and she will be forced to back down, or give up any hope of Britain becoming a centre for global tech.</p>The Flawed Rationale<p>The public pretext for this new push to break global ecommerce is the recent spate of anomalous killings by “Jihadists”. Criminal events, especially the more horrifying ones, are always outliers and statistical anomalies. The vast majority of the world’s people never encounter this category of event, and their safety must always come first; that means strong encryption by default.</p>♦<p>Politicians are very accustomed to making trade-offs. In this case, we are trading off the absolute fact of trillions of dollars and billions of people who use eCommerce being kept safe against the remote possibility of detecting and perhaps preventing extremely rare crimes against a vanishingly small number of people, the number of which when combined globally is lower than the number of people who die from mundane causes.</p><p>And when we talk about protecting people, we do not only mean protecting their money. Every aspect of your life is shielded by encryption, including all the private matters that you send or receive through your internet connected devices. Encryption keeps your private information away from everyone but the intended recipients. The government is only one hostile adversary out of many trying to gain access to your communications, money, medical records and location.</p><p>Encryption is democratic; it keeps everyone safe equally.</p>The True Reality<p>The age of the Security Services being able to read everyone’s communications at will is essentially over. The coming of this day was inevitable from the moment that PGP and SSL were developed and released. The net benefit to society is the emergence of global eCommerce and the massive reduction in online crime as the bad guys are permanently locked out.</p><p>If Melanie Dawes’ advisers were serious about reducing terrorism, they would advise a different foreign policy, which is the root cause of the terrorist problems facing Britain.</p><p>For example, Libya, had it been left untouched, would have prevented the immigration crisis facing the EU. The consequences of bad policy are the root cause of Britain’s problems, not encryption, and breaking encryption for everyone will not solve them. In fact, it will cause a cascade of knock on effects and another class of unintended consequences that will effectively end Britain’s place as a centre of tech for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Melanie Dawes must push back hard against the voices that are using fallacious arguments to get new damaging laws passed. If she does not, Britain faces a collapse of its tech sector, as building products that are safe for consumers will be impossible in the UK. The world has changed; not even the Communist Chinese are suggesting that global standard encryption tools be back doored, and they are using all the same software that is used in the west to protect their websites and communications.</p><p>We should not have to go through this process again and again every time there is a media frenzy over a killing spree. Someone in Boris’ government must be hired for the sole purpose of bring sanity to their pronouncements on everything related to software. Perhaps its time for a return of the “MinTech” cabinet position, which should be held by a member of industry elected by the software industry, and not a layman. This should be done before another suicidal piece of legislation is enacted, that at the very least, will waste everyone’s time defending their business models against it, and at worse, trigger a “Tech Exodus”.</p><p>Send me Bitcoin, Melanie won’t know…PROMISE!↴</p>♦♦

  <p>I don’t have an elaborate answer, other than that we plan to be honest with our children, and to acknowledge the lack of family network by finding other resources to compensate. My goal is to talk to my children in a way that I can still defend when they are adults and ask me “why did you do this or that?”. Another part of this will have to be to really be open for their feelings, questions, thoughts… talking is the best way to prevent trauma.</p><p>My wife has also broken from her family, which does make us feel isolated at times. That said, we’re both confident that it was the right decision to allow for true healing and to break the generational chain of dysfunction.</p>♦

  ♦Ideologies have not addressed the root cause of the problem that Bitcoin may solve<p>Until Bitcoin, I really didn’t have clear political views. I knew for sure every single politician sucked but didn’t really grasp why.</p><p>I focused on the fact that the world is now way better off than hundreds of years ago and as a result concluded that the current system is better than all alternatives.</p><p>I now believe that I should have not settled and instead should have expected more.</p><p>Escaping the Malthusian trap meant a few hundred years ago that we needed a scalability in money that only 3rd parties could provide. In other words, existing monies have serious bottlenecks in their transportation and storage.</p><p>In most commodities, depending on 3rd parties is not really a problem, but in money it is.</p><p>These 3rd parties, mainly States and banks accumulated unknown amounts of power during the last 200 years mainly for two reasons:</p><ul><li>Security has economies of scale: During the last many centuries, the larger your Army, the better</li><li>Credit money, that is, bank accounts, IOU’s with the telecommunications revolution since the telegraph, provided a scalability that gold couldn’t match.</li></ul><p>Interestingly, the two reasons are closely related to each other, as without the latter, chances are you won’t be able to accumulate power in the former, what has been traditionally known as the monopoly on violence.</p><p>When those 3rd parties started gaining power, injustice happened and socialists/communists wrongly believed that instead of eliminating the need to trust those 3rd parties, somehow making those 3rd parties even larger would solve the problem. It never worked, it only made things way worse.</p><p>Socialists should read the Selfish Gene, because if that book is correct, and common sense agrees, it means that we were born to cheat, to take advantage of each other. If we can take advantage of one another, we will, especially with strangers, non-kin.</p><p>Only a system that makes value exchange fair and inmediate by registering transactions inmutably and publicly can make that exchange fair and consequently promote cooperation, progress and growth. That system is called money and it is the most powerful tool to scale cooperation beyond the Dunbar number around us.</p><p>Other sides of the political spectrum suspected that socialists were wrong, but never really provided a solution other than “trust me, I will not cheat on you because I’m better than other politicians are”.</p><p>That’s what political parties do, that’s what bankers do, they sell you trust.</p><p>Banks buy the fanciest buildings in town to make you believe they are solid as a rock; politicians identify with you as kin so that you have the feeling you can trust them and at the same time, identify political adversaries as non-kin, so the intelectual discussion moves towards hormones and irrationality.</p><p>People waste gigantic amounts of time arguing with their hormones instead of using their brains. I expect this to change drammatically.</p><p>Satoshi’s main contribution is fixing the root cause of injustice; it eliminates the need for 3rd parties therefore eliminating the consequences of what both socialists and non socialists complain about. By eliminating money’s bottlenecks, it allows for what Nick Szabo calls social scalability.</p><p>Money makes it ok to take advantage of each other, as long as you get something acceptable in return. By making that value exchange comparable with subsequent value exchanges, people learn how valuable their work is, and are able to take appropiate decisions. Progress happens as a result.</p><p>Just as you don’t become better by studying in fancy universities but by making mistakes and learning, the world can only progress by making public mistakes comparable to each other, not by completely preventing them.</p><p>I now believe that only by becoming 100% Orwellian, will States be able to stop people moving towards a cybereconomy that will unleash levels of progress unknown to mankind.</p>♦

  Money is about credibly representing value transactions♦<p>According to the Selfish Gene book, we only want to exchange value or cooperate with strangers when there is an inmediate exchange. If we postpone this exchange, we are very likely to cheat (and even in the case we are not strangers!).</p><p>We are some serious cheaters according to this fascinating book and I agree.</p><p>Unless you believe we prefer to satisfy everyone else’s needs before our own, you must necessarily agree with this book, and this is important, because it explains money very well.</p><p>If you can’t give me something I value right now (barter), I want you to prove to me that you have provided value to someone else in the past, that is, I need a prove from you that you have made a value transaction earlier.</p><p>You must, as a result, be able to represent a transaction credibly.</p><p>What would you do if you had to represent a transaction in the most “credible” way 20.000 years ago?</p><p>I suggest that if you want to cooperate with me, whenever you provide value, you get in return something that is universally very scarce, so that you can’t tamper this representation easily. Otherwise I may have the feeling that you could be cheating me and again, you and I are very likely to do so.</p><p>But that something has to be easily recognizable by me, otherwise I won’t accept it either. If you want me to accept it, you’d better get divisible items, so that you can pay me smaller values. And chances are you will only accept stuff that is cheap and easy to transport. (in Menger terms, saleable in space and scale)</p><p>If I were you, I’d only accept stuff that is extremely cheap to store, that deteriorates the least over time, because you have no idea when your needs will arise, and that could be a long time into the future. (saleable in time)</p><p>Transferring the property of this stone must not depend on third parties, because otherwise those third parties are likely to cheat as well!!</p><p>During the first transactions, you will have no way of knowing if you are representing that transaction with the right-sized stone. It may be too big or too small. You won’t have any guarantees that the rest of humanity will accept this stone and as a result, you won’t be able to size it properly until this item is universally accepted by the market so that you can compare it. You’ll be gambling and speculating that you are sizing this transaction accurately. If it costs little to store, you will try to store as much as possible of it and as a result your gamble will have little cost.</p><p>Therefore that stone will be for you both a product you will use (a medium of exchange) and speculation too.</p><p>The market will slowly realize that by being data and software, Bitcoin is “the thing” that best solves each and everyone of these requirements.</p><p>The market should also understand that things that are valued are those which are stored, not those which are used because using them means buying and selling, so supply is kept high.</p><p>Storing means buying and keeping, limiting supply as a result. If Picassos were not kept, just seen in your home and then sold next day, then their value would tend to zero, but no, they are typically kept for decades.</p><p>Even if your shitcoin is designed to cure malaria, chances are that you will sell it inmediately after being used and as a result its value will tend to zero. With a value tending to zero, it is more likely that developers will end up curing malaria with Bitcoin than with your shitcoin.</p><p>For the n-th time, block, mute everyone speaking about shitcoins/blockchains, we have to be merciless with people that insist on being either ignorants or scammers.</p><p>Small note on Statism vs Libertarianism</p><p>I got into Bitcoin with a completely statist mindset, but understanding that we are programmed to cheat made me wonder if it does make any sense to pretend that Statism is the best way to organize ourselves.</p><p>It is also hard as a result for me to take seriously people that say they understand Bitcoin, and keep defending Statist views.</p><p>If we are programmed to cheat, and throughout history we have gone through the pain of using all sorts of monies in every single civilization as a way of solving it, does it make sense to spend each others resources in something named “common good”?</p>♦

  Introducing a New Generation of Entity–based On–chain Metrics Using Clustering and Advanced Data Science♦The Problem with Quantifying the Number of Bitcoin Users<p>A major question amongst Bitcoin researchers and investors has been that of knowing how many people actually own and use Bitcoin.</p><p>And even though Bitcoin’s entire transactional history is publicly accessible through its open ledger, assessing the number of users in the Bitcoin network is a non–trivial task.</p><p>Down to the present day, it is most often still the number of addresses in the Bitcoin network that is being used as a proxy to the number of Bitcoin users/holders.</p><p>However, it is well established that this approach is fallacious, mainly because there is no one–to–one mapping between users and Bitcoin addresses:</p><ol><li>Bitcoin addresses can hold funds from more than one individual (e.g. exchange addresses).</li><li>A single entity can own and control multiple Bitcoin addresses holding BTC.</li></ol>Beyond Address Counts<p>In order to obtain a more precise estimate of the actual number of users in the Bitcoin network, and how this number changes over time, more advanced methodologies are required.</p><p>At Glassnode, we have been working on this problem by applying a combination of industry–standard heuristics, proprietary clustering algorithms, and advanced data science methods on top of raw on–chain data.</p><p>In the present work we show the results of our approach and set a new upper limit on the number of entities holding BTC. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first to introduce a more sophisticated quantification of Bitcoin entities that goes beyond plain address counts and over–simplified heuristics.</p>Entities, not Users<p>Note that with our approach we only aim at solving one of the two confounding factors that follows from using addresses as a proxy to the number of users: mapping multiple addresses to a single entity.</p><p>We do not tackle the case in which a single address holds funds of multiple users: In this case the address holding the bitcoins is still controlled by a single entity on the network level (e.g. an exchange) — therefore we deliberately refer to our numbers as “entities” rather than “users” or “individuals”.</p><p>As a result of this work we implemented a set of live on–chain metrics that are live on Glassnode Studio and through our API as of today:</p><ul><li>Number of New Entities <br>The number of unique entities that appeared for the first time in a transaction in the Bitcoin network.</li><li>Entities Net Growth<br>The net growth of unique entities in the network. This metric is defined as the difference between new entities and “disappearing” entities (entities with a zero balance that had a non–zero balance at the previous timestamp).</li><li>Number of Whales<br>The number of unique entities holding at least 1,000 BTC.</li><li>Number of Active Entities<br>The number of unique entities that were active either as a sender or receiver.</li><li>Number of Sending Entities<br>The number of unique entities that were active as a sender of BTC.</li><li>Number of Receiving Entities<br>The number of unique entities that were active as a receiver of BTC.</li></ul><blockquote>Note: Because our entity metrics rely on clustering techniques and statistical information that changes over time, these metrics are mutable, i.e. most recent data points are subject to slight changes as time progresses. However, we have put the necessary mechanisms in place in order to obtain highly stable values that keep these fluctuations to a minimum (on average &lt; 1%).</blockquote>Quantifying the Number of Bitcoin Entities<p>In the following we present the results of our approach.</p><p>Figure 1 shows the number of new entities coming into the Bitcoin network per day — along with the number of new addresses as comparison.</p>♦Figure 1 — Number of daily addresses/entities that appeared for the first time in a transaction in the Bitcoin network.<p>Because our methods involve clustering addresses into entities, the resulting number of new entities noticeably represents a fraction of the number of new addresses in the network. For instance, in 2019 the average number of new addresses added to the Bitcoin blockchain per day was over 355k. In comparison, the average number of new entities was only slightly above 100k, representing a ratio of ~28%.</p><p>Figure 2 shows this ratio of newly added addresses and entities over time.</p>♦Figure 2 — The ratio between the number of new daily entities and new daily addresses.<p>Note the potential signal that can be extracted from this ratio. For instance, a clearly visible downwards peak at the beginning of 2018 showing an increased discrepancy between new addresses and new entities can be observed, suggesting increased activity of existing users in the network (e.g. new addresses were actually change addresses), rather than new players coming into the space.</p><p>The comparison between the number of daily active addresses and active entities paints a very similar picture:</p>♦Figure 3 — Left: Number of daily active addresses and entities. Right: Ratio between active entities and addresses.So, How Many Entities Hold Bitcoin?<p>Figure 4 depicts the daily net growth of entities in the network. As compared to new entities, this number accounts for “disappearing” entities as well: Entities with a zero BTC balance, which had a non–zero BTC balance at the previous timestamp.</p>♦Figure 4 — Daily entities net growth.<p>Using the cumulative sum on this time–series we obtain the estimated number of entities at each given point in time. Figure 5 shows the results along with the number of non–zero addresses as comparison.</p>♦Figure 5 — Total number of addresses/entities with a non–zero balance.<p>According to our analyses, as of January 2020 the number of entities holding Bitcoin is ~23.1 million. This is 18.5% less than the current number of non–zero addresses (~28.4 million).</p><p>Moreover, it is notable that the number of entities increases monotonously. Sharp downward spikes as observed in the number of addresses at the beginning of 2018 are not present when looking at entities.</p><blockquote>According to our analyses, as of January 2020, the number of on–chain entities holding Bitcoin is about 23.1 million.</blockquote>Healthy Bitcoin Growth<p>It is worthwhile comparing the daily net growth of entities and the net growth of addresses (Figure 6). For one, the volatility in address growth is significantly higher than that of entities, with considerable amplitude deflections — both positive and negative.</p><p>More importantly, the daily net growth of entities is consistently positive: In Bitcoin’s history there have been only 21 days so far in which the net entity growth was negative.</p><p>This is a clear indication of a healthy and consistent adoption of Bitcoin over the past 10 years.</p>♦Figure 6 — Comparison of daily addresses and entities net growth.Number of Whales<p>An additional entity–based metric we added to our list of on–chain metrics is the number of whales: We define whales as entities that hold ≥ 1,000 BTC. This metric gives a more precise estimation of the actual behaviour of whales that does not rely on single addresses. Note: Entities that we have labeled to be exchanges are excluded from these numbers.</p>♦Figure 7 — Number of addresses/entities holding ≥ 1,000 Bitcoin.<p>Even though both curves show similar trends, the counts of addresses and entities holding ≥ 1,000 BTC differ significantly providing a more exact estimate of whale behaviour at particular points in the market cycles.</p>Distribution Statistics<p>The following graph depicts the number of entities as a function of the entities’ size (number of addresses controlled by an entity).</p>♦Figure 8 — Distribution of the number of entities with respect to their size in terms of clustered addresses (January 2020).<p>The chart shows a clear power–law relationship, with entities’ sizes raging from a single address up to entity clusters consisting of almost 22 million addresses (Coinbase).</p><p>Note: The bulk of our clustered entities (~96%) still consist of a single addresses. Therefore our numbers serve as a strict upper limit for the number of Bitcoin entities. Including potential missing links the actual number is possibly lower than our provided upper boundary.</p><p>Similarly, the number of entities as a function of their balance reveals a power–law distribution with the bulk of entities (~22.3 million) holding less than one Bitcoin (omitted in the distribution graph below).</p>♦Figure 9 — Distribution of number of entities with respect to their Bitcoin balance (January 2020). All entities with a balance ≥ 100k BTC are crypto exchanges.<p>With respect to large entities, as of January 2020 there are 75 entities that hold 10,000 or more BTC, and 7 entities than hold 100,000 or more BTC — all of which are exchanges: Coinbase (983,800 BTC), Huobi (369,100 BTC), Binance (240,700 BTC), Bitfinex (214,600 BTC), Bitstamp (165,400 BTC), Kraken (132,100 BTC), and Bittrex (118,100 BTC).</p><p>These 7 richest entities (exchanges) control over 2,350,000 BTC.</p><p>That is ~13% of the circulating Bitcoin supply.</p><blockquote>Live charts of Bitcoin balances on exchanges are available here.</blockquote>♦Figure 10 —Balance distribution of entities in the Bitcoin network (January 2020).<p>Special thanks to Kilian Heeg for the research and development of the present work.</p><p>Live metrics on Glassnode Studio:</p><p>Number of New Entities <br>Entities Net Growth<br>Number of Whales<br>Number of Active Entities<br>Number of Sending Entities<br>Number of Receiving Entities</p>♦<ul><li>Follow us and reach out on Twitter</li><li>For on–chain metrics and activity graphs, visit Glassnode Studio</li><li>For automated alerts on core on–chain metrics and activity on exchanges, visit our Glassnode Alerts Twitter</li></ul><p>Disclaimer: This report does not provide any investment advice.

  <p>Something many bitcoiners fear is what happens if Bitcoin starts succeeding to the point it becomes annoying for Governments.</p><p>There is no doubt that unless you are an absolute privacy expert, which are the minority of Bitcoin holders I dare say although definitely increasing, you could be subject either to a fair amount of pressure from authorities or in the worst scenario to several different kinds of pain.</p><p>If that ever happens, it will prove Bitcoin’s need in the long run, but at that point none of us will be interested in the long run but in a short term solution to our situation.</p><p>That’s why I’ve lately been thinking that the work being done by Companies focusing their efforts in developing countries are widely underestimated. I’m thinking of Jack’s recent visits to Africa for example, which, if I’m not wrong, had to do with promoting Bitcoin over there.</p><p>Both Countries with Bitcoin friendly jurisdictions and those with weak Governments where they are not able to control the finances of their populations, should be thought of the plan B for many bitcoiners if or when things can get ugly.</p>♦

  <p>Hi Thor,</p><p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts. While interesting, I think you’ll have to think about it a bit more deeply, because unfortunately it contains a few detrimental flaws.</p><p>&gt;Alice is its owner. She can add a block at the end of X, in which she writes: I would give this blockchain to Bob. After the block broadcast, Bob becomes the new owner of X.</p><p>The problem is that Alice can fork the chain by giving it to Bob AND Carol. Now there is no more consensus. It is exactly this “double spending” problem that Proof-of-Work resolves.</p><p>&gt;Although each ownership blockchain has an owner, the ownership blockchain group is highly decentralized. Everyone can join freely and every user has exactly the same rights.</p><p>Note that there is no mechanism that allows one “ownership blockchain” to recognize another, and there is no inherent limit on how many “ownership blockchains” can exist. This would likely just create lots of altcoins.</p><p>It would be nice if your mechanism worked, but sadly consensus is not that easy. Keep up the good work!</p><p>Cheers,<br>Ruben</p>♦

  Real Estate Moneyness♦Maybe when “orange number go up”<p>It’s been a while that I’ve been wondering what the future holds for the value of real estate in a bitcoinized economy and I think I’ve finally reached a few conclusions.</p><p>If you believe as I do that Bitcoin is a black hole for moneyness, there is no doubt that the largest chunk of real estate’s value will move towards Bitcoin.</p><p>But in my opinion this will not happen homogeneously.</p><p>First, a Bitcoinized world should after some time, create important progress and that should make real estate an interesting second diversification investment for a small (in relative terms) part of the world’s moneyness.</p><p>But secondly, there is no doubt that in a physical economy as the one we still enjoy, most employment has been created in large cities, and as a result massive amounts of people have flown to them during the last 100 years.</p><p>Surface within this cities is limited, and real estate scarce as a result. The consequence has been regular price increases that make inhabitants dedicate a large percentage of their income to paying rent.</p><p>While this keeps being this way, real estate in large cities should keep a premium over real estate elsewhere.</p><p>If on the other hand you believe that we are moving into an increasingly remote internet based job market, chances are you will reach the conclusion that the demand on real estate in large cities will start decreasing shortly, making its price decrease at the same time.</p><p>I think that long awaited remote work, already foreseen by the likes of Arthur C. Clarke in the 1970’s was disappointing at first, but that it is starting to happen more and more. I also think that these kind of features of the job market have massive inertias and existing companies are unlikely to change their culture and philosphy over night. It is more likely to become a thing for start-ups, so it will take time.</p><p>But it will keep happening and consequently, I believe that if you want to diversify your bitcoins into something different, real estate away from traditional/conventional locations that depend on aglomeration economies is a good idea, unless those cities are the typical ones that are working as extremely attractive tourist attractions (I can’t think of New York losing its touristic appeal even if the job market significantly worsens)</p><p>I think that real estate markets, those likely to see lots of people moving in, like, pretty towns, places with particularly nice weather or with good quality of life, are safer bets.</p>♦

  <p>Jiang Zuouer of BTC.top posted a rather… interesting analysis of their plan to fund BCH development with 12.5% of the BCH coinbase award for 6 months starting in May. If you haven’t seen the proposal, the idea is for the miners to form a cartel where they will orphan any blocks that don’t give the developer subsidy, meaning they have some assurance that they have at least 51% (more likely in the 70% range) to make good on this threat. The game theory on that is interesting, as BCH has a 10 block rule that will make any orphaning with less than 60% of the total BCH hash power pretty risky, but that’s a post for another time.</p><p>What I want to focus on in this article is Jiang Zhuoer’s claim that BTC miners are actually partially paying for this plan.</p>The Claim<p>Let’s break down the claim step-by-step.</p><blockquote>Because of the hash ratio between BTC and BCH, and the difficulty adjustments that maintain an equilibrium, it is the entire set of SHA-256 mining (including BTC mining) that bears the cost under this plan.</blockquote><p>The hash ratio between BTC and BCH has a theoretical equilibrium point based on price. We’ll use round numbers here for the sake of simplicity. If BTC is worth $9000 and BCH $1000, given the same block reward, 90% of all available SHA256 hash rate goes toward BTC and 10% to BCH as that’s the game-theoretical optimum. If miners move from BCH to BTC, they lose money in opportunity cost, same for the reverse, provided the price stays the same. Whenever price changes, (say BTC is worth $9400 and BCH $600), BCH miners are making less money and BTC miners are making more, causing BCH miners to move from BCH to BTC. The hash rate ratios quickly go to 94% for BTC and 6% for BCH as about 4% of all miners are incentivized to move to BTC.</p>♦<p>The 12.5% tax is similar to a price change. A miner that was making $1000/day on BCH now starts making $875/day on BCH because of the dev tax. This means that the hashing power of BCH will lessen by 12.5% given that everything else stays the same.</p><p>Thus far, we have no reason to believe that BCH won’t be paying the cost of the 12.5% tax. In fact, BTC will get more hashing power and a more secure network at the cost of BCH hashing power and less security on their network!</p>Assuming a Static Global Hash Rate<blockquote>This is counterintuitive: With 12.5% of the coinbase being donated, then on first glance, it would appear that BCH miners simply give up 12.5% of their rewards and would then lose 12.5% of their hash as well.However, after difficulty adjusts on BTC, it is a different story.</blockquote><p>The difficulty adjustment does put some difficulty into the calculation. BCH’s difficulty adjustment algorithm adjusts pretty quickly to keep the blocks at 10 minutes. This was done because they experienced a much lower percentage of the total hash rate and there were many 12-hour periods during their first difficulty adjustment algorithm era where they found few, if any, blocks.</p>♦<p>What the difficulty adjustment algorithm does is make each block easier to find so that the blocks continue being produced at 10 minute intervals, regardless of hash rate. The algorithm has some serious security vulnerabilities, but that’s a post for another day.</p><blockquote>Assume round numbers for illustration: BTC is 97% hash and BCH 3%.If BCH gives up 12.5% of its reward, that 3% goes to about 2.6%, and BTC would go to 97.4%.</blockquote><blockquote>0.375% of the total SHA-256 rewards are being pulled out of the entire system, but this cost will be split between BTC and BCH in the same ratio as the hash (97:3).The BCH hashrate will be diminished by 12.5%, but BTC mining will bear 97% of the cost of the diminished profitability, because there will be more hash competing for the same BTC rewards.</blockquote><p>So here’s the meat of the argument. Essentially, Jiang is arguing here that BTC miners are actually bearing the brunt of the cost because more hashing power is needed per block after BTC’s difficulty adjusts to reflect the new miners coming in from BCH.</p>First Order Effects<p>To illustrate the deceitfulness of this argument, let us use an extreme example. Say 90% of the reward is going to the BCH developers. If BTC/BCH hashing power is split 97%/3% before the reward goes into play, 90% of the miners on BCH immediately leave after the reward goes into play. The hashing power split becomes 99.7%/0.3%. The difficulty on BCH quickly adjusts to allow 0.3% of all SHA256 hashing power to mine a block in 10 minutes. The hashing power on BTC eventually adjusts to allow 99.7% of the total SHA256 hashing power to mine a block in 10 minutes.</p>♦<p>So what’s changed here? 99.7% of mining has to compete for the same rewards as 97% from before, so there’s roughly 3% less reward on a per-hash basis. Same for the 0.3% in BCH, as Jiang has pointed out. As far as the reward analysis goes, this is true. Seems like a free lunch paid for by BTC, as Jiang is asserting.</p>Second and Third-order Effects<p>But there are further, second-order effects here. 3% more miners on the BTC network mean that the profitability has changed and the miners at the margin will now no longer make profit. If all costs and prices stay the same, the miners whose profit margin is less than 3% of the reward will simply stop running their miners. In other words, supply of hashing power will react to the reduced demand.</p>♦<p>Depending on how many miners are operating at the margins, the amount of hashing power dropping out may be more than 3% or less than 3%. If it’s more than 3%, the difficulty will adjust again and equalize at a level that’s actually more profitable than before the whole dev tax began to the miners on BTC. If it’s less than 3%, the difficulty will adjust and equalize at a level that’s less profitable than before the whole dev tax began to the miners on BTC, but more profitable than the simplistic situation Jiang outlined. Of course, making it 3% easier will bring back those marginal miners as a third-order effect, but this is why claims like this are ridiculous. You can’t examine just the first order effects and claim the cost is being paid only by those.</p>First-order Security Costs<p>Furthermore, BCH is paying out the same 6.25 BTC per block for 87.5% of the security as before the dev tax! The BCH network is essentially paying their miners the same amount for less work so they can pay their developers. And who pays for the BCH network? Well, it’s really the holders of BCH. They are the ones whose percentage of BCH is being reduced by the inflation. In a proof-of-work system, the inflation and fees pay for security. And since the fees on BCH are negligible, the cost of the security goes up proportionate to the amount of the tax. The holders of BCH are getting less security for the same dilution.</p>♦<p>Consequently, exchanges and merchants will need to increase the number of confirmations needed by 14% (1/0.875) to get the same level of security against double-spending attacks, slowing everything down.</p><p>In a coin supposedly focused on transacting frequently, this is a strange trade-off to be making.</p>Conclusion<p>The cost to BCH is not just “BTC is going to pay for 97% of it”. As I’ve shown there’s a significant amount of costs in security and second order effects. Jiang’s argument is the equivalent of saying if Canada raises taxes, it’s actually the US that pays for most of it. With the logic being that anyone who leaves Canada will go to the US and cause more competition in the US labor markets and that will allow Canadians staying to make that money back. This is theoretically true if examining cherry-picked first-order effects, but those effects are only a small part of all the consequences.</p>♦<p>What BCH is doing is removing a part of the market for SHA256 hash power, which is, of course their prerogative to do. Essentially, they are lowering the demand for all SHA256 power with the dev tax. By this cherry-picked logic, changing the proof-of-work algorithm or killing proof-of-work altogether would be even better since then SHA256 power has to all go to other places, making BTC mining less profitable at least on a cherry-picked, first-order basis.</p><p>The shortsightedness of this policy is truly something to behold. What are they going to do after 6 months if this tax policy is successful? Continue it? What happens after the next halving if the price hasn’t changed? How about the halving after that and the halving after that? Long term, the block reward becomes less than the dev subsidy meaning something will have to give. The BCH developers are obviously going to want to continue the subsidy. Do the miners screw over the developers by ending the subsidy? Or is BCH just going to change their inflation schedule to fund both the miners and developers?</p><p>This policy has the potential for a whole lot of drama and I, for one, will be getting some popcorn.</p>♦

  <p>by Ross Ulbricht</p>♦<p>During my years in prison, I have had many hours to read, think and meditate. Many ideas have germinated and grown in my mind during this time. I’d like to share one with you here that builds on my background in physics. It is based on two ideas that sound far fetched but are in fact accepted by many of the leading physicists, neuroscientists and philosophers of our day, and are supported by a long record of observation. I will lay them out here up front and then explain what I mean below.</p><p>The first idea is that every conscious moment of your life (including the one you are having now) is a discrete unit, unattached to the moments before or after it. The second idea is that our observable universe is just a small piece of a much larger multiverse throughout which there are many such conscious “observer moments.” So, because each observer moment is discreet, and there are — as we will see — many observer moments throughout the multiverse that are identical to the one you are having, there is no way to know which one you are.</p><p>The science behind these ideas is deep and fascinating, touching on the frontiers of consciousness research and cosmology. I will propose at the end of this essay an experiment that anyone, even you, can conduct to test these ideas. But first, let’s talk about the multiverse.</p>The Multiverse Hypothesis<p>As our ability to observe and understand our universe has grown over the past century, scientists have uncovered some inconvenient information that is forcing us to expand our conception of our place in the cosmos. There appears to be a number of parameters that describe the fundamental nature of our universe that are fine-tuned for our existence. For example, if electrons were much lighter, there would be no stable stars (including our sun), and if there were much heavier, ordered molecules like DNA would not form. Parameters affecting dark matter and energy, electromagnetism, the masses of the fundamental particles and more, all must be fine-tuned (sometimes to within 30 decimal places!) for life as we know it to exist.</p><p>Did we just get lucky? Did God set things up just so? Or is there another explanation?</p><p>Take a parameter unique not to our universe, but our solar system: the mass of the Sun. The bigger a star’s mass, the brighter it shines, and the Sun is no different. If the Sun was 20% heavier or lighter, Earth would be hotter than Venus or colder than Mars and thus uninhabitable. But the masses of stars in general can vary 1000-fold. The Sun’s mass appears to be fine-tuned for life on Earth, just like the universal parameters mentioned above.</p><p>Now that we have telescopes strong enough to see them, we know there are a multitude of planets around vast numbers of stars that are clustered into galaxies billions of lightyears out in every direction. Even if most of these planets are uninhabited because their solar systems aren’t just right, is it any surprise that we live on a planet in a solar system that is? If we didn’t…well we wouldn’t be around to ask such questions, would we?</p><p>It seems possible at least, if not likely, that our universal parameters appear fine-tuned for the same reason. We live in a universe fine-tuned for life among a vast sea of universes with different settings. Even if life is impossible in most of them, is it any surprise we find ourselves in a universe where it is? This vast sea of universes is the multiverse, and the evidence for it is all around us, including our own existence.</p><p>In his book, “Our Mathematical Universe,” Max Tegmark gives a convincing argument for four different levels, or ways, our universe could be part of a multiverse. The first, based on standard cosmology, says that our universe is infinite in scope. In every direction we look, galaxy clusters are uniform at the largest scales. There is no apparent edge or center. It just goes on forever. So, the region we are in and could have any hope of interacting with is just one of infinitely many. In that unbounded set of regions, anything that can happen is happening.</p><p>The second level is based on inflation theory, which is a widely accepted explanation for our Big Bang, the geometry of space, and the uniformity of galaxy clusters. Tegmark argues that, to accept inflation theory, one must accept that our universe is just one of many where inflation has collapsed, creating a bubble universe where random values for the universal parameters have been set. Again, just because the parameters in our particular bubble universe were set randomly, yet turned out perfectly for life, doesn’t mean luck or intelligent design are necessarily at play. If the dials are spun a huge number of times, eventually they will land this way. It shouldn’t be surprising we are in one of the few bubbles that can support life given that we are in fact alive.</p><p>The third and fourth levels are even more mind-bending. They involve branching universes for every possible outcome of quantum events and a completely abstract set of all possible mathematical objects of which the other levels are just one.</p><p>Regardless of which scenarios are true, there is good reason to believe that our universe is not the only one. Just as we discovered that Earth is not the only planet, the Sun is but one of many stars, and the Milky Way is not the only galaxy, our universe is not the only one either. Maybe we will have time to name it some day to distinguish it from others?</p>The Observer Moment Hypothesis<p>Given a multiverse where — somewhere and somewhen — there is every combination of matter and energy possible, there must be other conscious observers out there aside from us here on Earth. Their experiences may be wildly different from our own. The full range of our conscious experiences — from seeing blue to feeling velvet, from falling in love to being enraged, our most exalted thoughts and our basest drives — may all be a tiny subset of what it is possible to experience.</p><p>Even a mundane moment, like being stuck in traffic, is rich with what psychologists and neuroscientists call “qualia”: the feel of the car seat on your legs, the warm steering wheel on your palm, the seatbelt pressing on your hips, the vibration of the engine, a horn honking, the traffic report on the radio, the sun reflecting off the hood of your car, frustration at being late, envy of people in nicer cars, mentally replaying a conversation, and on and on.</p><p>Each qualia is a mental object that makes up an observer moment. These moments are strung together like beads, each connected to the last by your memory. The moment after you hear the horn blare, that sound no longer exists for you except in your memory. We trust our memories to give us a good approximation of previous moments, but all we really have access to is what we are experiencing right now.</p><p>In the vast multiverse, there may be a simulation running somewhere of the exact observer moment you are having right now, complete with all the sights, sounds, thoughts, feelings and memories you have this instant. How do you know you are you and not that simulation? What is the difference between the two? You might say you are different from the hypothetical simulation because you actually have a past whereas the simulation has just the illusion of a past from its artificial memories. But what exactly is connecting the observer moments that make up your life?</p><p>Imagine you board a train in Paris bound for Berlin and quickly fall into a deep dreamless sleep. You are completely unconscious and have no observer moments until you wake up at the station in Berlin. After a moment’s disorientation, you know exactly who you are, where you are, where you were before you fell asleep and what your plans are in Berlin. The last observer moment you had was several hours prior and far away in another country. Yet, there is perfect continuity between it and your current experience.</p><p>So, it is not time or space that connects observer moments. It is the imprint each one has on the next via memory that gives them the illusion of being strung together.</p><p>But time itself isn’t an illusion, right? The jury is still out on that one. As our top physicists work out quantum gravity, our best understanding of time comes from Einstein and his famous theory of relativity. He showed us that, rather than time and space being fundamentally different dimensions in our universe (3 space dimensions and 1 for time), we in fact live in a universe with 4 of the same dimension called “space-time”, a so-called “block universe.” So, time is real but our experience is like a frame in a movie. Our experience is like hitting play, but the universe is the DVD itself. It just is.</p><p>If you’ve never encountered these ideas before, smoke might be coming out of your ears right about now. There are all sorts of bizarre implications that stem from the picture of reality modern physics is unveiling. Do a search for subjective immortality or Boltzmann brains for a taste. And let’s not even get started on what this all means for free will.</p><p>Instead, we will turn to an hypothesis of my own which, as promised, will lead us to a simple experiment that you can conduct to test these ideas. If this has already been proposed elsewhere, I apologize and give full credit where it is due, but I can’t easily do that kind of literature search from prison.</p>The Universal Consciousness Hypothesis<p>To understand this idea, let’s go back to that traffic jam, jam packed with qualia. The more qualia contained in that observer moment, the rarer we can expect identical observer moments in the multiverse to be. Let’s walk through this to see what I mean.</p><p>Imagine you are in the traffic jam and you close your eyes. All the sensory input (qualia) from your field of vision is now missing from this new moment. Anyone hearing, feeling, thinking, etc. the same things you are — without any visual qualia — anywhere in the multiverse, is now indistinguishable from you and you from them. You are like the same frame in the movie on the DVD of all existence.</p><p>Now turn off the radio. Shut off the engine. Undo your seatbelt. One by one you remove qualia, and the resulting observer moment becomes less and less rare because there is less and less to distinguish it from other observer moments. Conversely, if more unique qualia were to be added, such as getting into a car accident, the new observer moment would be rarer. If the multiverse isn’t truly infinite and just ridiculously huge, a moment like our traffic jam might even be unique.</p><p>One way to think of this is, as qualia are removed, there are more and more past moments that could seamlessly merge into this one. And there are more that could come after, each one with different qualia added back in. When you turn the radio back on, the sound it makes will be one from every possible observer moment that fits with the one you were just having. Of course your memory of the radio from before you turned it off will match what you hear in the new observer moment. There will still be continuity because you have memories from many prior observer moments, but for a moment, the set of all observer moments you were a part of was enlarged.</p><p>What would happen if we kept removing qualia? What would there be if there were none left? Would we still be conscious? It turns out that people have been training their minds to be free of every kind of mental object for thousands of years. We call them Buddhist monks, and they have some very interesting things to say about empty observer moments.</p><p>John Yates is a neuroscientist who has been practicing and teaching meditation for more than 40 years. In his book, “The Mind Illuminated,” he tells us that an untrained mind is constantly jumping from one thing to another, never paying attention to one specific thing for more than a few moments. As soon as interest wanes — even a little — our minds supply us with a new object of attention from our peripheral awareness or from our unconscious.</p><p>During meditation, the practitioner sits still and focuses on the sensations of her breath. We live with these breath sensations our whole lives, and rarely do they hold any important for our conscious minds. They are about as boring and neutral as can be. So the mind (sometimes immediately) directs attention elsewhere. The practice of meditation is to redirect attention back to the breath over and over with the intention of sustaining attention there.</p><p>With enough deliberate and diligent practice, it is possible to train your mind to pay exclusive attention to a single object (such as breath sensations) for as long as you wish. It is difficult to describe the experience because it is so different from everyday states of consciousness, where our minds are constantly looking around for input to integrate into the ongoing narrative of our lives.</p><p>As one gets better at meditation, thoughts, feelings and sensations (qualia) that used to powerfully capture attention fail to do so and remain in peripheral awareness. Ignored long enough, they eventually recede from conscious awareness altogether. It is particularly odd when primary senses that have been ever-present in one’s whole life disappear, such as hearing, vision and proprioception (a sense of your own body).</p><p>Another interesting experience common among advanced practitioners is when enough layers of qualia have disappeared that individual observer moments can be distinguished from one another. Instead of experiencing the illusion of change over time (as when we hit play on a DVD), the individual frames are experienced independently of one another. Losing the subjective experience of time is a radical departure from everyday perception and leads to an experience congruent with our “block universe” understanding of reality, where there is no unique dimension for time.</p><p>Eventually, one can train to the point where entering and maintaining this state is effortless, so even the qualia resulting from that effort disappears. Along this journey of self-discovery and self-mastery, superficial aspects of your consciousness and the diversity of qualia that capture your attention fade away. What is left could be called empty consciousness or pure consciousness.</p><p>According to our discussion above, such a state should be universal to all empty conscious observer moments regardless of the particulars of their local physical surroundings.</p><p>It doesn’t matter if you are 6&#39;2&quot;, missing an arm or full of food if you are not aware of your body. It doesn’t matter if you speak Chinese or Greek if you are not thinking. And it doesn’t matter which universe you are in if there are no qualia to distinguish you from any other observer moment void of qualia in any other universe. In a sense, one in a state of this “universal consciousness” has merged with the largest possible set of observer moments, a universal set from which countless histories and futures branch off.</p><p>What would you guess this experience is like? You might think it is empty and dull because there is nothing there to experience, but it is not. Adept practitioners throughout the ages describe immense pleasure and joy, peace, serenity and deep, intuitive understanding. They describe experiencing a sense of oneness and interconnection. They describe insight into impermanence, emptiness, the nature of suffering and the illusion of the self as separate from the rest of existence. And they all describe the same thing, just as we would expect them to if our ideas are correct.</p><p>Not only is there a test for the universal consciousness hypothesis (and thus the multiverse and observer moment hypotheses), but it has been run over and over in a huge variety of conditions with consistent results. Every person on Earth can test it out for themselves if they wish, even you dear reader. All you have to do is sit and focus. If you are truly interested in or already walking this path, I highly recommend reading “The Mind Illuminated” to benefit from the knowledge and guidance of those who have gone before us.</p><p>For myself, I have been practicing daily for over four years. I am not an adept. There is a ways to go before I can sustain exclusive attention effortlessly, but I have gained some skill and occasionally glimpse the rarified states and insights I read about. What I have described is just an hypothesis that fits what we already know about consciousness and cosmology. There could very well be another explanation for the common experience of adept meditators. But then again, it might be true. At some point, our understanding of these subjects may advance to where we can make testable predictions and prove them wrong or right. Until then, it’s fun to believe we are not alone when we sit and focus and find a moment of serenity. I’ll see you on the path.</p>♦

  ♦Whenever an oil pipe is not enough, you need to store it as cheap as possible<p>I can’t stop thinking about the striking similarities and analogies among commodities, energy markets, Bitcoin mining and Bitcoin itself.</p><p>If you think about it, every single commodity, in order to satisfy a need, needs to be transported wherever it is demanded, therefore it needs to be transported over space.</p><p>But whenever a bottleneck arises in the transportation capacity or if the demand doesn’t match in terms of time that of supply, you need to make it travel through time, that is, to use proper storage, minimizing deterioration of this commodity.</p><p>Transportation and storage are two sides of the same coin. If transportation’s throughput is limited, storage will need to be large. With most commodities, this is the case. For example, harbours world wide are packed with warehouses where commodities are stored waiting for an empty ship to be available.</p><p>If on the other hand storage is limited, as it is the case of electricity, transportation will need to be large (also known as the grid) otherwise you get blackouts (frequently electricity supply shocks).</p><p>Commodity money has the exact same considerations: you need it to be good to travel through space and time (and scale, to follow Menger’s own words)</p><p>This is where Bitcoin excels: it’s extremely low cost of storage (taking into consideration its low maintenance, low to zero inflation, zero deterioration, etc…) make it “especially well suited for time travel”. No other kind of money except for gold is as good as Bitcoin for value time travel.</p><p>Interestingly, most wealth worldwide demands time travel rather than space travel if you compare how much narrow money is worth (good for space travel) with everything else (real estate, gold, financial products, offshore money, etc…). The latter is orders of magnitude larger. Things that are stored for long periods of time are exchanged less frequently, which means the supply is smaller. If the demand is large enough (and demand for the utility of exchange definitely is), the price will be very large.</p><p>But this shouldn’t be surprising as the time of a human life is the most scarce resource of all. Our demand to maximize our well-being has as its most important limitation the time we have to achieve things in life. You could argue that with unlimited time, we should be able to satisfy all our needs without the need for cooperation.</p><p>But the fact our time is limited can only be solved with a way to make value travel for as low a cost as possible. That is what money is all about. We have never in history had an opportunity to fight limited human time as we currently have with Bitcoin. Unless you agree with the keynesian views that expenditure is all that matters, the ability to save properly and securely over time should help an unprecedented level of progress.</p><p>For energy commodities, it is coincidentally interesting that the competitor for its transportation and storage is precisely Bitcoin mining, which turns an energy delivery standard such as electricity into a value delivery standard such as money. That is, it turns one standard (energy) into another (value)</p><p>It should blow your mind as much as if I told you I have a device that turns weight into length for example.</p><p>This is a topic I’m most interested in and if you have ideas or even theories on how all of this could be linked together, I can’t wait to read your comments either here or in my twitter account (@acrual)</p>♦

  Bitcoin is Henry Ford’s Energy Currency♦The New-York Tribune article in 1921Ford’s Energy Currency<p>99 years ago, Henry Ford, one of the greatest businessmen of all time, planned the development of an “Energy Currency” to replace gold. Ford’s goal was to end wars which he argued were centered around the control of money:</p><blockquote>“The essential evil of gold in its relation to war is the fact that it can be controlled. Break the control and you stop war.” New-York Tribune, 1921</blockquote><p>Ford proposed an energy backed currency would stop wars because every country could issue currency backed by their “imperishable natural wealth” of energy resources, such as the US Muscle Shoals Dam.</p>♦Henry Ford at Wilson Dam, Muscle Shoals 1921Bitcoin meets Ford’s definition for an energy currency<p>When asked “Have you worked out a standard of value?”, Ford responded:</p><blockquote>“Under the energy currency system the standard would be a certain amount of energy exerted for one hour that would be equal to $1.”</blockquote><p>Ford suggested a currency backed in kilowatt hours (kWh) and this is exactly what was found for Bitcoin in Bitcoin’s Energy-Value Equivalence - Bitcoin is “backed” by energy input.</p><p>For the last 10 years, 80% of Bitcoin’s price history is explained by a 1-to-1 constant value against energy input. Like all markets, price fluctuates around value. But price and value are intrinsically linked and mean-revert. Bitcoin has a fixed value through time based on the mining energy exerted and its supply growth rate.</p><p>Ford also envisaged a fully backed currency:</p><blockquote>“Mr Ford proposes that this currency be issued only to a certain definite amount and for a specific purpose.”</blockquote><p>In other words, you could only issue more energy currency if you put more energy-in, and this is exactly what Bitcoin does. All else equal, the more energy you put in as an individual miner, the more freshly minted Bitcoin you will receive. On the other hand, the more energy that all other miners put into mining Bitcoin the more difficult, and costly, it is for you to mine Bitcoin.</p>Bitcoin’s value using Ford’s energy standard<p>In Bitcoins Energy-Value Equivalence, Bitcoin’s value is expressed in “Joules” of energy, but it can just as readily be expressed in “kWh” as dreamed of by Ford.</p><p>As 1 kWh = 3.6 million Joules, if energy input and supply growth rate are measured in kilowatts and hours respectively, Bitcoin’s Fiat Factor ($/kWh) becomes:</p><blockquote>7.2E–9</blockquote><p>Given today’s (20 January 2020) supply growth rate, Bitcoin’s Energy Value can be expressed in kWh as:</p>♦Bitcoin’s Energy Value in “$/kWh”<p>Today, the Bitcoin network is consuming approximately 6.9 million kWh of energy, so one Bitcoin is worth almost $12,000.</p><p>Said equivalently, 1 Bitcoin today is backed by 1.66 trillion kWh of energy and growing.</p><p>Bitcoin is unique as it has an exponentially decreasing inflation rate. Under constant conditions, for any individual Bitcoin Miner more energy is required in the future to produce the same amount of Bitcoin as today. This makes the Supply Growth Rate a critical component of Bitcoin’s Energy Value.</p><p>Because Bitcoin’s Supply Growth Rate is decreasing, and will drop substantially with the halving in May 2020, the above “V-today” value will effectively double over the next year. Some simple math will tell you what that means for Bitcoin’s intrinsic value.</p><p>Bitcoin’s energy “backing” is growing exponentially. As a result, it is likely we continue to see the hyperinflation of the US Dollar, and all fiat currencies, against Bitcoin until this trend stops.</p>It didn’t work out for Ford<p>In the 20th century, there was no way to accountably and immutably link the value of energy to a unit of currency. Further, there was no motivation for the establishment to even consider a “energy currency” system which could make their existing sources of wealth and power redundant and would certainly remove their ability to pull the levers of monetary policy.</p><p>We know that Ford’s plans didn’t eventuate. After three years of unsuccessfully bidding for the Muscle Shoals Dam to kick start the project, he abandoned the plans in 1924 stating:</p><blockquote>“A simple affair of business which should have been decided by anyone within a week has become a complicated political affair.”</blockquote><p>This is not surprising. Many years later in 1984, Austrian economist Friedrick Hayek noted:</p><blockquote>“I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government. That is, we can’t take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop.”</blockquote>♦Friedrick Hayek<p>Hayek pled for the denationalization of money, believing monetary policy has not done any good, only harm. The full interview with Hayek is well worth a watch.</p>The 21st century energy currency<p>Today, an energy backed currency run by the people, which is immutable by any individual organization, can make Ford’s “Energy Currency” and Hayek’s “Good Money” a reality.</p><p>To date, Bitcoin has found a way around politics. It has predominantly evaded it and continued to grow in distribution, security and adoption. The longer this journey continues, the harder it becomes for any individual country to stand against Bitcoin — enhancing its “Lindy effect”:</p><blockquote>“The Lindy effect is a theory that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.” Wikipedia</blockquote><p>Of course, there are many risks facing Bitcoin. These have been discussed at length in the past. The market has weighed the risks and opportunities, and the current decision is reflected by a growing Bitcoin Energy Value.</p><p>As long as mining energy continues to increase, Bitcoin is executing a silent takeover of fiat currencies. In fact, despite a 2-year bear market, Bitcoin’s energy value, and hence the network’s security and intrinsic value, is at a new all-time high as of 20 January 2020.</p>♦Bitcoin has never been worth more than today (20 January 2020)<br> [Live metric available on TradingView here]The Energy Standard<p>Ford was a century ahead of his time. We now know that an energy backed currency can work.</p><p>In 1921, Ford posits some advice for the skeptical:</p><blockquote>“It’s simply a case of thinking and calculating in terms different from those laid down to us by the international banking group to which we have grown so accustomed that we think there is no other desirable standard.”</blockquote><p>Bitcoin is money backed by energy.

  ♦Photo by Julia Caesar on UnsplashDigital Asset Exchanges to Pick Sides in Hong Kong<p>Late last year, the SFC (Hong Kong’s securities regulator) announced a new regulatory framework allowing digital asset exchanges to be regulated by the SFC. This move was met with interest from around the world as various jurisdictions propose new regulatory regimes for the space, and exchanges serving Hong Kong customers face new scrutiny and decisions about how to proceed. The newly drafted regulatory framework would allow the SFC to issue licenses to these exchange venues, though they appear to be having a difficult time finding insurance coverage for funds held on exchange, a requirement of the proposed regulatory framework.</p><p>On closer inspection of the proposed changes, it’s evident that further analysis is warranted. Aside from the insurance requirements, two other directives are important: first, the regulations apply only to exchanges dealing with legally-defined securities. The SFC outlines that operating an exchange venue that offers securities trading (even a single trading pair) is the qualifying criterion for these regulations — otherwise, the scheme is opt-in. Second, the regulations would also require exchange venues to restrict access to the exchange to those individuals who qualify as “professional investors”, similar to accredited investors in the US.</p><p>This combines two hot debates in the cryptocurrency sphere and might force Hong Kong exchange venues to pick a side: what is and isn’t a security, and who should have access to this new asset class?</p>Exchange Insurance Requirements are Expected<p>In requiring insurance for custodied digital assets, the SFC is acting largely as we have expected from regulatory bodies. The guidance recognizes the underlying digital assets as bearer instruments, whereby there is no delineation between possessing the asset and owning it. Adequate insurance coverage ensures that there is effectively a separation between ownership and custody: if the custodian or exchange realizes a risk event that is covered by insurance, their client might in effect still have claim to their lost assets.</p><p>Furthermore, the regulations require that a maximum of 2% of funds may be held in hot (online) wallets with full insurance coverage, while the rest must be held in cold (offline) storage with a minimum 95% of the value of those assets insured. This can sound like a strong step in the right direction with regard to investor safety, however, we encourage further discussion and guidance on how to interpret this requirement. In particular, policies can and do exist that would meet this requirement by the letter of the law, while still falling short in terms of their scope of coverage.</p>Classifying a Security<p>A security is popularly defined as a tradable financial asset. A classic test of whether or not something is an investment contract, which is always a security, is called the Howey Test. This test asks whether “a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.”</p><p>Bitcoin by design has no entity for issuing such a security; nor can the issuance of Bitcoin be captured and leveraged to raise capital. As such, Bitcoin can not pass the Howey Test and in 2019 the SEC Chairman clarified that Bitcoin is not a security. This clarity places Bitcoin in opposition to many other cryptocurrencies, but even so, there remains substantial regulatory ambiguity. For example, while the initial offering of Ethereum tokens at ICO passes the Howey Test and was almost certainly a securities offering, the SEC has indicated that the Ethereum token ceased to be a security once the network reached a critical size, at which point the token was better treated like a commodity.</p><p>This definition illuminates the pending SFC regulations in a new light: if an HKD/BTC trading pair is not in the purview of the SFC, which cryptocurrencies might be?</p>A Bifurcation in the Exchange Market<p>The proposed framework is an opt-in licensing scheme, meaning that qualifying exchanges can choose whether or not to become licensed. This is presumably because some non-security assets like Bitcoin don’t fall within the SFC’s remit, while others would be expected to classify as securities. This means an exchange can choose not to become licensed without risking an enforcement action by ensuring it does not expose trading pairs containing security assets. The head of the SFC, Ashley Alder, recently stated that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “are not securities” and the SFC “only has the power to regulate a platform that trades virtual assets or tokens which are legal securities or futures contracts.”</p><p>Rather than an attempt to regulate all digital asset exchanges, these regulations instead appear to be the SFC positioning itself for a future environment in which tokenized securities, such as equities, are being actively traded. This helps explain why the regulations also outline that exchanges seeking a license must restrict access to “professional investors” who have an HK$8M (approx. US$1M) portfolio — a standard requirement for Hong Kong securities investors. In the cryptocurrency exchange business, most users are retail, meaning that choosing to abide by these regulations could kill a substantial amount of trade volume, such that many exchanges may choose to continue existing outside of the SFC’s remit.</p><p>So how might an exchange continue to serve its retail customer base and avoid falling under the purview of the SFC? It likely requires restricting the trading pairs on offer to ensure there’s no grey area as to whether or not a customer is trading a security. It follows that this new scheme in Hong Kong might force a bifurcation in the local cryptocurrency exchange market. Exchange venues appear set to choose which side of the market they want to be on.</p><p>Already we see that Hong Kong-based exchange OSL has applied for the regulatory sandbox, and Huobi, by virtue of already being listed on the Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Market (HKex), might also be an early beneficiary of the scheme. Given how substantial the Hong Kong market is, it will be interesting to observe where other venues fall.</p>Until Next Time<p>KNØX is just getting started.

  ♦The Last Fiduciary, a film directed by Rian Johnson and starring Jerome W. Van GorkomIntroduction<p>In various talks, tweets and papers, Professor Angela Walch has popularized her view that blockchain protocol developers are or should be deemed fiduciaries of blockchain network participants.</p><p>While many of her concerns with blockchain technology are valid, her specific view that fiduciary duties do or should apply to free open source software developers have been ably rebutted (and, in my opinion, conclusively refuted) Blockchain Development and Fiduciary Duty by Raina S. Haque, Rodrigo Seira Silva-Herzog, Brent A. Plummer and Nelson Rosario.</p><p>Nevertheless, the fiduciary duty meme continues to enjoy a certain popularity. I therefore wish to supplement prior academic criticisms with some quick-and-dirty practical counterarguments in the hope that, when those are combined with the more detailed black-letter law arguments set forth in Blockchain Development and Fiduciary Duty, people can move on to more productive proposals for how the issues Walch raises are best mitigated.</p>Unmodified Fiduciary Duties Barely Exist Today in Any Actual Commercial Relationship<p>Most of the case law on fiduciary duties comes from Delaware court opinions on how the members of the board of directors of a corporation owe fiduciary duties to the corporation’s stockholders.</p><p>Corporations are one of the few remaining state-chartered entity types that impose non-waivable default fiduciary duties on the managers of an entity-based enterprise. Most U.S. states allow the definitive agreements governing “un-corporations” like LLCs to completely eliminate all fiduciary duties that otherwise would be implied by the applicable statute governing such entities or the common law. And, in a majority of cases, the management and investors in such “un-corporations” do in fact opt to eliminate vague fiduciary duties in favor of no duties or very light and precisely defined contractual duties.</p><p>Even in the case of corporations, which continue to impose some non-waivable fiduciary duties, such duties have been whittled down to a bare minimum. As a result, corporate managements’ duties toward stockholders are effectively no longer fiduciary duties in the classic sense, but are a set of rather narrow and specific duties defined by carving back fiduciary duties through a complex web of D&amp;O insurance and exculpation and indemnification arrangements agreed to by contract, which in turn are to be interpreted against a backdrop of robust and specific case law explaining how any fiduciary duties that remain play out in various scenarios. In effect, even in the context of corporations, the fact that fiduciary duties still nominally apply to managers is an accident of history or path dependence — the actual duties assumed by actual corporate directors/officers are radically different from, and are far more narrow and predictable than, “fiduciary duties” in the classic sense.</p><p>To flesh this out a bit more: In response to a famous case called Smith v. Van Gorkom 488 A.2d 858 (Del. 1985), where the Delaware Supreme Court held that members of the board of directors of a target corporation were liable for negotiating and approving an acquisition of the corporation in a grossly negligent manner and thus breaching their fiduciary duty of care, the Delaware legislature enacted Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. 102(b)(7) allows a Delaware corporation to specify in its charter documents that breaches of the duty of care by directors are “exculpated” — which effectively eliminates fiduciary duties for all practical purposes. The DGCL also authorizes corporations to indemnify and insure directors against nearly all other breaches of fiduciary duties, except those that essentially involve conflicted self-dealing, fraud or crime — i.e., breaches of the duty of loyalty. Even some of those breaches may be insured against, if they resulted from good faith behavior.</p><p>Just as with un-corporations, as a practical matter, every corporation that receives competent legal advice in fact utilizes these protections and dramatically limits management’s fiduciary duties. Effectively then, directors’ and officers’ fiduciary duties are in practice limited to a duty not to do things like embezzlement that would likely be illegal even if fiduciary duties did not apply. Narrow exceptions exist in very well-defined conflict of interest scenarios that do not apply to blockchains — such as situations in which the directors are negotiating an acquisition of the corporation by a third party and the risk of breaches of the duty of loyalty due to conflicts is deemed so high that the directors face heightened, but still relatively well-defined, fiduciary duties. Even there, a result like that found in the Van Gorkom case is now impossible — directors in practice do not owe stockholders a fiduciary duty to negotiate a great deal. They merely must act in a loyal manner in negotiating the deal.</p><p>Of course, the above is a discussion of duties owed by management of a company to its investors. Angela Walch’s theory goes further than that, and would require software developers to have fiduciary duties to software users who typically will be using the software for free. In modern markets, technology companies do not owe fiduciary duties even to their PAYING software users — they usually owe a bare duty not to commit gross negligence (product torts) plus very narrowly defined contractual duties like a simple software warranty. A fortiori, the software developers who work for technology companies do not owe fiduciary duties — they don’t owe them to the technology company, to the technology company’s stockholders or to the paying software users. They are mere service providers owing, at most, light contractual duties to their employer.</p><p>The few areas where unmodified fiduciary duties still survive today in ordinary commerce are in situations of deeply personal, inherently obvious and highly regulated agency relationships like the relationship of an attorney or accountant to a client, or the relationship of a trustee to a beneficiary. These are about as dissimilar to the relationship between any software developer — not to mention a FOSS contributor — and the user of that software as day is to night.</p>If We Wanted to Impose Duties On Devs, We Would Not Make Them Fiduciaries, But Rather Would Impose More Specific Duties<p>Even in the context of corporations, the fact that we still speak of “fiduciary duties” is essentially an example of path dependence. No one who wanted to reach the same result as we have in corporate law today would look at it and say: “Hmmm, you know what I think we should do? Create some big fuzzy vague default legal duties and then kill them in a death by a thousand cuts with a complex webwork of charter exculpation provisions, indemnification and advancement of expense arrangements, D&amp;O insurance policies and as-applied legal doctrine spread out over hundreds of court opinions.” While law often evolves in that messy fashion and ends up in a reasonably good place despite the mess, no one designing a system of policy-driven incentives through regulation or contracts would ever proceed in such torturously convoluted path on purpose.</p><p>Thus, even assuming arguendo that we wanted software devs to wind up owing a similar set of duties to users as, say, the directors of a corporation owe to its stockholders, in my opinion we would never try to get there by first imposing fiduciary duties and then carving them back. Instead, we would cut to the chase: i.e., we would just impose the actual duties we want the developers to end up having. Those would not be common law “fiduciary duties” writ large, but rather would be the kinds of duties directors and executive officers of corporations functionally have — narrow, reasonably well defined duties to avoid conflicted self-dealing, refrain from committing crimes in connection with their jobs, etc.</p>If Fiduciary Duties Were Imposed On Devs, They Would Cope With Them The Same Way As In Other Industries, And Thus The Fiduciary Duties Would Effectively Become Contractual Duties Anyway<p>Furthermore, if fiduciary duties were imposed on devs in their raw state, then devs would respond in one of two ways: (1) stop doing the development, since it is now too liability prone and (in the case of FOSS devs) they are not paid, so the activity will have become un-economical; or (2) organize themselves in ways that let them eliminate fiduciary duties as a matter of law. Modern law and commerce offers pretty much anyone numerous paths to contracting out of default nebulous duties. Developers could form an LLC and opt to eliminate all fiduciary duties under the LLC. Developers could insure themselves against the risks. Developers could build into the FOSS license provisions wherein users of the software waive all fiduciary duty claims. Etc. Thus, a proposal to impose fiduciary duties on devs only makes sense if one is also proposing to make all these possible, and perfectly legal, countermoves illegal. That would be a radical change to modern commerce and law that few people would support.</p>Reductio Ad Absurdum #1 — FOSS Devs Should Not Have More Liability To Free Software Users Than The CEO Of Apple Inc. Has To Apple Stockholders<p>For the reasons discussed above, under Walch’s view a dev voluntarily contributing code to Bitcoin Core for free would have greater duties to an unknown user of Bitcoin who has never paid the dev in any way and who the dev is not in privity with and may not even know exists than Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc.., has to Apple Inc. stockholders, which is already way higher than the duties that the typical fund manager has to the funds’ LPs.</p><p>This result is absurd and untenable and constitutes a reductio ad absurdum of Walch’s position.</p>Reductio Ad Absurdum #2 — FOSS Devs Should Not Have More Liability To Free Software Users Than Apple Inc. Has To Paying Apple Software Users Or Apple Inc.’s Developers Have To Paying Apple Software Users<p>For the reasons discussed above, under Walch’s view a dev voluntarily contributing code to Bitcoin Core for free would have greater duties to an unknown user of Bitcoin who has never paid the dev in any way and who the dev is not in privity with and may not even know exists than:</p><p>(1) Apple Inc. has to paying Apple software users (minimal duties, basically just avoid committing product torts);</p><p>(2) the directors and executive officers have to paying Apple software users (no duties); or</p><p>(3) a paid coder at Apple has to paying Apple software users (no duties).</p><p>This result is absurd and untenable and constitutes a reductio ad absurdum of Walch’s position.</p>Conclusion<p>Blockchain devs in general are not fiduciaries, and, even if one thought that as a matter of policy it were a good idea to impose legal duties on blockchain devs, fiduciary duties would not be the logical or natural vehicle for doing so. While Walch is right to point out the subtle ways developers can exert power and influence, her views on how best to mitigate those issues hearken back to an old, pre-1960s view of corporate law and agency law where fiduciary duties were commonly used in commerce and still had force and meaning as such. This is no longer the case. In contemporary law and commerce vague fiduciary duty standards have, directly or in effect (depending on context) been superseded by precisely defined and usually very narrow contractual duty standards.</p><p>We should find other ways, more consistent with the bedrock cypherpunk principles of social-trust-reduction, free entry and free exit, to deal with the power free open source software developers wield. This may include clarifying tort liability for gross negligence in producing free open source software or offering voluntary contracts to be entered into by developers with private organizations which backstop social losses from their work if they agree to abide by certain transparency and conduct principles.</p><p>Veritas in numeris!</p>♦

  ♦<p>I frequently come across, like I guess most of you, people who repeat the mantra of “Bitcoin has failed” or “Bitcoin is going nowhere”, blah, blah, blah.</p><p>As I recently said in twitter, I find it hilarious; when I hear/read this, I have the same feeling as if someone told me my home or my computer have failed.</p><p>If value is subjective, who do you think you are to tell me something that I find useful has failed for me?</p><p>I can agree with you that my house or my computer may suck to your standards, but how can you know if it is not good enough for me? Isn’t that extremely arrogant?</p><p>Let me tell you a really brief story:</p><p>Something like 10 years ago, I got a speeding ticket yet I didn’t find out until it was very late because notifications from the authority were going to a former address of mine. So I was getting those notifications there but I had already moved somewhere else. Apparently I have the obligation to notify this authority in my Country, that I was actually moving, but I didn’t know.</p><p>Given the constant delays in payment, the ticket was getting larger with extra penalties.</p><p>Then one day, I can’t remember how, I found out that my bank accounts were about to be blocked. I was not married and didn’t have kids at the time, but the mere possibility of running out of money was one of the most scary experiences I’ve been through. I don’t think I have ever felt this powerless. Now married and with kids and with a communist regime in power which believes my individual well being is secondary to their ideology, it is as scary as it gets. It was me against bureaucrats on the other side of the phone that were simply following orders and for whom I was a mere ID number.</p><p>Until then, I thought this kind of things only happened to people that didn’t pay their taxes or criminals…</p><p>I don’t live in Afghanistan but in an EU country, so I can only imagine the number of problems people in that kind of countries may go through regularly.</p><p>If you think Bitcoin’s volatility is a problem, you are likely to have never experienced full volatility, that is, seeing your money going down to zero.</p><p>This is what many pundits don’t see. If there are some initial use cases for Bitcoin in developed countries, just think of the potential eventual demand elsewhere. If the cost of storing this part of my wealth is both microscopic and censorship resistant compared to any other form known to us, then there is definitely a gigantic potential appreciation, becoming a good investment idea too. I’m as a result both a user and a speculator.</p><p>It all comes down to what you consider a success for Bitcoin. For me the fact it is already useful for me and many others is a complete success. Whether there is a tiny chance of it being attacked is irrelevant. My government could ban wine tomorrow and that wouldn’t make wine useless or a failure overnight.</p><p>When did the iPhone succeed? When it reached $1m in sales? $10m? $5 billion? Or maybe 20 million users? or 100m?</p><p>For the same reason, has Bitcoin succeeded? If you can enjoy its utility already, I think it has. If not, what defines its success? And what defines its failure?</p><p>Whether you have not discovered its utility yet, that’s an entirely different matter</p>♦

  Adapting Schmitt&#8217;s Theory of the Partisan for Digital Space



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The terrible transformation of the world, which has been accomplished by the headlong expansion of power, lies in that things beyond the measure of our physically given sense of perception have been made visible, audible, perceptible; perceptible and thus capable of possession.  The new concept of ownership, or much more: the domination of the functions; cuius regio, eius economia [Whose realm, his economics], is now cuius economia, eius regio [Whose economics, his realm]. The new Nomos [law, custom, or social fabric] of the earth; no more Nomos.&#8221;  </p><cite>&#8211;Carl Schmitt, Glossarium, 1947</cite></blockquote>



<p>To expand upon the hypothesis that bitcoin and crypto assets are explicit military assets of war, I would like to extend my analysis into the new topographical space that is the internet and how war will be conducted in this space through the lens of Carl Schmitt&#8217;s Theory of the Partisan (ToP). </p>



<p>This shall be part of a larger series attempting to marry the theories of sovereignty of Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin, Giorgio Agamben to cryptosovereignty. Through taking Schmitt&#8217;s work (as I have done before with Political Theology) and applying these ideas towards Bitcoin specifically and crypto on a whole, we will have a much better understanding of cryptography&#8217;s relationship to war. Through analyzing Bitcoin as a preeminent tool of war, and how anyone may use this power to become a &#8216;crypto-partisan&#8217;, we start to unveil the radical power hidden at the heart of Bitcoin. It is the episteme of cryptography in the digital age; the rhizome which allows for the deterritorialization and remapping of the global (and eventually cosmic space) along new territorial lines that will renewed the nomos of humanity. </p>



<p>Through extending ToP to the digital age, and by understanding crypto as first and foremost as a technology of asymmetrical defensive warfare, we can see the new topographical lines that the internet opens to warfare. By understanding cryptography as the key technique of this new figure of history&#8211;the crypto partisan&#8211;and their hidden revolutionary war, we can come to understand the truly explosive potential of what is hidden in &#8216;crypto&#8216;. It is from here that we can understand what the coming new nomos of humanity will look like through the use of cryptography as the base technique to reorganize the political, and come to challege the nation-state itself. </p>



<p> As Schmitt explicitly states at the very end of (ToP): </p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The theoretician can do no more than verify concepts and call things by name. The theory of the partisan flows into the question of the question of the concept of the political, into the question of the real enemy and of a new nomos of the earth.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<p>Through a deep reading of ToP, we can extend its theory of war into the current digital age and illuminate a &#8220;new theory of war and enmity&#8221; hidden at the center of cryptography. It is a novus ordo seclorum created from the new kind of social contract that is hidden in crypto and the promise that must Bitcoin must cointain.   </p>



Aspects And Concepts Of The Last Stage



<p>Let us begin where Schmitt left off in the final chapter of ToP in defining the last stages of the evolution of the partisan. By extending and updating this analysis into the current age with the same methodology that Schmitt uses, we can trace the evolution of the partisan from a telluric power to a caelumic [Caelus, Sky] one. Through tracing the linage of the partisan from &#8220;the national and patriotic heros who take to the woods, i.e., all that is characteristics of the elemental, telluric power to repel a foreign invader&#8221; to the current space the digital partisan is native to, we find a new understanding of the topology of war. It is one in which the potestas spiritualis [spiritual authority] of the land empire of the state is abandoned for the unidentifiability and infinite topological space of the &#8216;caelumic&#8216; nature of cryptography in the digital age. </p>



<p>We will follow the four concepts that Schmitt defines in ToP: the spatial aspect; the destruction of social structures; the interlocking global-political context; and lastly, the technical industrial aspect, of which all feedback into the later for our first analysis. Through a deconstruction of these concepts through the lens of Bitcoin, what crypto means in a Big Brother globalized society of advanced surveillance, and the total unbracketed civil warfare (stasis) that is the destruction of privacy by all states; we start to see the topography of this last stage of total unbracketed war. Here in the thick fog of war, we see the ghostly spectre of the caelumic nature of the crypto partisan as the final figure of the coming cyphernet. </p>



The Spatial Aspect



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Completely independent of the good or ill of men, of peaceful or hostile purposes and goals, any enhancement of human technology produces new horizons and unforeseeable changes in the traditional spatial structure.&#8221;</p><cite>Carl Schmitt, ToP, p. 68</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bitcoin is the technological development of our age which has opened a new horizon for human action and freedom through the fundamental transformation of the topographical spaces of both property and war. Through the novel and unforeseeable consequence of what bitcoin has enabled through cryptography; Bitcoin has secretly declared war on every state, and all fiat money&#8211;the nourishment of any modren state. By changing the topography of economics to one totally digital in nature, and by using the mathematical forces of cryptography to create provable systems of protection, we find that crypto economics inverts state economics, fulfilling what is quoted at the beginning of this article: cuius regio, eius economia [Whose realm, his economics], is now cuius economia, eius regio [Whose economics, his realm] (Schmitt, Glossarium, 1947).</p>



<p>By sacrificing the realm of the law, for the imperium of cryptography, Bitcoin has inverted the order of law through expropriating the realm of economics into the digital as an explicit strategy not to escape the law; but to destroy it. Through this totally non-violent economic praxis that strikes directly at the root of the state&#8217;s gluttonous ways through fiat money and the seigniorage it must contain; Bitcoin creates an economic strategy of starving the Behemoth of government through withdrawing one&#8217;s economic wealth from its parasitic and criminal ways.</p>



<p>Now that bitcoin has broke the link between the state and capital, the final existentialist crisis of law, the emergency of cryptography may begin. </p>



<p>In conjunction to the direct protection of cryptography that is used to shield one&#8217;s identity (and thus depriving the state of being able to label on as &#8216;friend&#8217; or &#8216;enemy&#8217; of the state) and command total privacy, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is simply a function of truth-in-account for bitcoin units. All units of the system must have proof-of-work&#8211;real thermodynamic energy expenditure behind them in order to be minted or exchanged.  In other words,  </p>



“Veritas, non auctoritas facit legem.” 



<p>(Truth, not authority makes legitimacy) </p>



<p>This is an inversion of Hobbes&#8217; dictum of sovereign power found in Leviathan, and is a weaponized form of truth in a world that is governed by lies that go so deep, it is simply called authority or law. </p>



<p>The spatial aspect of the evolution of warfare into a digital topology will always flow back into the natural defensive posture that crypto takes within the confines of the internet, and the citadel of the cyphernet that it is building as the premonition of the coming crypto age. It is in this last stage of development where the state has anointed itself as a god capable of anything, demanding to know all about everyone&#8211;there becomes nothing, nothing outside of the state&#8211;not even life. This causes for zone of indistinction that blurs all of life, politicizing everything, always reserving the right to criminalize anyone, depriving them of all economic, social, and political means and ultimately the rights to a life itself. </p>



<p>In this zone of indistinction, where the private life and political cause obscure so deeply with each other that they become one; economics itself corroborates with the security state, completely destroying the political concept of the commonality of wealth; namely the most basic commonality: the law itself. </p>



<p>It is the destruction of the polis through the fusion of bios and zoe into one, that has allowed for the creation of the infinitely watching eyes and ears of the technological panopticon. This surveillance apparatus exist to ensure that no one may have any real privacy anymore and that any human may be captured by it, and pulled beyond the law. This is the real state of emergency that has already destroyed our laws, our nomos. </p>



<p>This battle over the law is a stasis; a never-ending global civil war that contains all of life, and every nation-state on the planet. It is bellum omnium contra omnes of the greatest order. Or as Foulcault said more eloquently, &#8220;Isn’t power a sort of generalised war which assumes at particular moments the forms of peace and the State? Peace would then be a form of war, and the State a means of waging it.”</p>



<p>While the darkness and fundamental evil that is at the root of such a vision of paranoia and delusional psychosis that is the totalitarian surveillance  state of the modern age is difficult to look at; it is the world that we now live within, and is a fundamental fact that we must deal with. However, with such gross and systematic violations of not just privacy, but all of our God-given rights, the coming shipwreck of politics and law is already written, the crisis only needs to begin. </p>



<blockquote><p>“The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “emergency situation” in which we live is the rule. We must arrive at a concept of history which corresponds to this. Then it will become clear that the task before us is the introduction of a real state of emergency; and our position in the struggle against Fascism will thereby improve.”</p><cite>-Walter Benjamin,&nbsp;On the Concept of History, VII</cite></blockquote>



<p>Is there no state that does not demand to violate every single person&#8217;s privacy for the safety and security of the state? Is there no person that cannot be labeled &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217; to become be deprived of all rights and law?  This current state of emergency that has become all of our lives has violated all spaces of privacy, and demanded to interlope into all facets of life. There is no longer any space in which any person may be left alone. </p>



<p>The expansion of the surveillance state into the digital sphere is its final projection of power, and its attempt to abolish privacy through this technology is its final move in the consideration of power under this state of emergency. It is where the state can attempt to fulfill its bureaucratic destiny of attempting to seeing all things and attempt to organize all of human life and activity under the sinister rubric of &#8220;society must be defended.&#8221; </p>



<p>With Big Brother leering down at all of us with hate, vile, and contempt for the meager possibly of being an enemy; we see the digital cages and open air prisons being formed around us. It is a reality where each one of us will be ascribed digital signatures (not unlike the tattoos of the victims of the holocaust) which chains each of us to data to enables a kafkaesque reality&#8211;a total surveillance state. It is a reality in which we never know if we are really being watched or not; if we will ever get access to the law, or only stand waiting before it, hoping to one day have access. </p>



<p>At the same time that the noose of the panopticon is tightening around each one of us; the true nature and power of cryptography presents itself in all of its glory. It is the final unstoppable individual right and choice to create privacy through cryptography, and to choose to create the personal wealth and freedom that allows for anyone to slip free of this noose. Through the infinite brinkmanship of privacy violations by the state and their corporate allies; so too is the development, deployment, and dissemination of personal open-sourced cryptographic technologies, and the ability to resist such personal privacy violations. </p>



<p>This brinkmanship of surveillance ends with the state demanding to know everything about every person for reasons that are state secrets&#8211;classified only for the worthy state agents and secret spy courts to know and decide upon. Naturally, through the expansion of the surveillance state into the digital sphere and the private lives of everyone; a total unbracketed civil war on privacy itself is initiated. The theater of this total unbracketed war of surveillance now opens into the plains of our private homes and into the digital noosphere that contains all of modern life. </p>



<p>In a world where privacy is being destroyed by every state, the crypto-partisan naturally presents himself as the final revolutionary figure to counter to such a nightmarish panopticon. With Satoshi Nakamoto at the helm of this new class of anonymous crypto-anarchist vanguard, the new topography of war displays itself momentarily as the fog of war shifts to a new dimension and space; where a new social order is being established beyond physical lines. </p>



Destruction of The Social Order



<blockquote><p>&#8220;A Commonwealth exists as res publica, as a public sphere, and is challenged if a non-public space develops within it, which actually repudiates this public sphere. Perhaps this explanation is sufficient to demonstrate that the partisan, who displace the technical-military conduct of the 19th century, suddenly reappeared as the focus of a new type of war, whose meaning and goal was the destruction of the existing social order.&#8221; </p><cite>ToP. p. 72</cite></blockquote>



<p>At the dawn of the 21st century, the internet ushered in something totally new and unexpected&#8211;a new kind of surveillance that could look directly into the homes and lives of people. With this the machine of state capitalism could accelerate its plans for The End of History and The Last man, with man&#8217;s final consignment to a safe life in the walled gardens of state capitalism; the empty promises of liberalism with a &#8220;safe&#8221; life of endless worthless empty work. It was the final bold move in the shift from state capitalism to oligopolic empire, that the technological panopticon became the device of power to bridge this gap.</p>



<p>While both the state and its greedy allies of consumerism could see the potential of the new data people were generating as early as the turn of the century; the full scope of the technological panopticon could not be complete without a &#8216;state of emergency&#8217; that would allow for the full-scale, uncensored spying on all information generated by everyone. The idea of privacy itself had to be destroyed, and only a state of emergency would suffice for such a bold violation of personal privacy and civil liberties. </p>



<p>It is this &#8216;state of emergency&#8217; which would allow for the full liquidation of all constitutional rights, and to allow for systematic, pervasive, all-seeing surveillance to watch everyone, everywhere, all the time, for any reason it sees fit under the sinister slogan &#8216;Society Must be Defended&#8216;. This opportunity for such a state of emergency would come on September 11th, 2001, with the terrorist taking center stage of the political theater that would ensnare the lives of every person on the planet. Through the panopticon of global surveillance that could now be justified through the emergency to &#8216;stop the terrorist&#8217; a state-security based network of globalized monitoring is being deployed. </p>



<p>The Chinese Communist Party has perfected this &#8217;emergency&#8217; and created a surveillance panopticon for the horrific purpose of genocide and ethnic cleansing. They have already started exporting this technology, and the window of opportunity to fight back is dwindling quickly. </p>



<p>With the mechanical eye of the machine of the state starring directly each of us, appraising each move, twitch, and shift we make, constantly seeking to appraise if we, the subject, is a political friend or enemy that must be subjected to punishment and discipline. This was my point in the sovereign, the subject and crypto power, is that anyone can be deprived of their rights from any state for reasons that are deem &#8216;state secrets&#8217; to everyone. </p>



<p>The internet has destroyed all old social orders, and concepts of privacy, fully liquidating them around the global through the power of the panopticon. This has allowed for governments, businesses, or organizations anywhere to reach directly into the lives of anyone they see fit. Through the destruction of privacy, the social order is liquidated and replaced by the governmental rules of any state; whatever color of greed or oppression they may be. </p>



<p>Only in the total darkness and raw authoritarianism of &#8216;the state of emergency&#8217; would the the total destruction of all social orders and private wealth be possible. This is the real state of emergency is the impossibility of a private life, or a private wealth that is beyond the state for any reason. With the social order is collapsing into itself, the state leaves no remainder between private and public life. Life itself becomes a zone-of-indifference in which there can be no private life without the state for any reason. </p>



<p>It could only be from a world of this madness that something as miraculous as Bitcoin could be produced. Something like Bitcoin could have only been created in a world where law had abandoned itself totally for the banal avarice of greed and petty material things generations ago. Only in a world where the stupidity and vacuity of a world ran under the slogan of “Auctoritas, non veritas facit legem” (Authority, not truth makes legitimacy) could the truth of something like Bitcoin go beyond being just revolutionary and become the Parousia itself. </p>



Global-Political Context



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The partisan is dependent on the constant help of a community in a technical-industrial position to provide him with the newest weapons and machinery.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p.75</cite></blockquote>



<p>It was only after the failure of the Soviet Project was the possibility of the global technological revolution that is the single internet possible. Only a widely deployed, global, single decentralized internet would be able to developed its own culture, identity, norms, and most importantly ethics that would produce Bitcoin; but also cultivate and raise cryptography on a whole to where it is today. The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace more than twenty years ago already contains embryo of values that are reflected in the current autochthonous culture of the internet that has propelled crypto and Bitcoin to where they are today. </p>



<p>Since Barlow&#8217;s declaration decades ago, a whole generation of people have been raised on the internet who have similar sentiments, values, and desires as reflected in that declaration. These are the people who would be called the indigenous of the internet; the caelumic peoples of this noosphere that is only ours. These natives understand that the machine of technology is but a tool for the extensions of their own power. They are the ones who have built this place and are starting to realize the reality of what they can do with such a power. It is from these indigenous people that a renewed commonality of wealth has been forged where the motto &#8216;Pro Aris et Focis&#8216; rings true for a new class of people and their coming of age. </p>



<p>It was however only with governments turning this technology against their own citizens that the struggle for this technology first started to grow. While the anarchist roots of the cypherpunks have always been present, it was only with these struggles that crypto-anarchist were produced through the code they deployed. Here we find the first traces of crypto-partisan, and the rudimentary tools from which he will liberate himself from the walled garden of society which has become a prison for all.</p>



<p>It is with the turn where governments everywhere are deploying digital technology only for the systematic violation of their own citizens, and to more deeply entrench bureaucratic controls for their own power does the crypto-partisan&#8217;s shadow start to be seen. It is from beyond the bondage of identity that he whispers secret facts that are not part of the propaganda agenda, or official media to be consumed. Facts are offered on how to escape from the incessant monitoring, how to create assured privacy, and where to find tools to hack the system and go beyond their sight and permissions. It is a praxis of blinding the technological machine and using that position as a fulcrum of power. </p>



<p>The crypto partisan offers tools and technology of the mind, methods of spiritual sacrimony, and the ability to create a private God to whom only you are privy with. It is a power to see beyond the veil of economic slavery to show anyone that there is something much, much more to this place than meets the eye. It is the possibility that we may each unlock as we start to understand the hidden power lying waiting at the center of Bitcoin, waiting for only the worth to have. </p>



<p>It is the premonition of a world that has lost its nomos; a world waiting for its providence after god has died and enough time has passed to try to remember Him, and the grace and glory of his being-in-the-world. </p>



<p>As one of the greatest poets of modren history has foretold: </p>



<blockquote><p>Armies cannot stop an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. No army can stop an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. Nothing&nbsp;is&nbsp;as powerful as an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. There&nbsp;is&nbsp;one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that&nbsp;is&nbsp;an idea whose&nbsp;time has come.</p></blockquote>



The Technical-Industrial Aspect



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Only revolutionay war made him [the partisan] a key figure of world history.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p. 77</cite></blockquote>



<p>Today the figure of the partisan is absolutely seen in the image of Satoshi Nakamoto&#8211;the first vanguardist of the crypto age. He alone initiated the total unbracketed war against all state using an explicit strategy of non-violent economic action through asymmetric cryptographic techniques to wage his revolutionary war. In taking this action, along with the political statement etched into the genesis block for all of time to see, Satoshi&#8217;s war started more than a decade ago and has been secretly building towards its revolutionary cause ever since. Satoshi, by perfectly obfuscating the image of the digital partisan, and the image of the bitcoiner, he created a new form of partisan for his war in the digital space; the crypto-partisan. </p>



<p>It is this figure, the Anonymous Other with loyalty to no state and conceals his identity for his protection alone, who is also the crypto partisan. It is this figure who has caelumic roots found directly in the internet who can call this territory local and their home. The crypto-partisan has a desire to keep the internet open-sourced, with strong privacy, and no boarders.  The crypto-partisan has no need for physical identities, and can stands on their own merit and signature alone. There is no need for police or physical corrosion here; just the code alone. </p>



<p>With bombaste and zeal like no other, the crypto partisan techniques go well beyond the mechanization of the code, and into the theater of politics and art alike. It is a pathos of war robbed of is physical nature and where the topology of war evolves beyond physical space, where violence no longer hodls any sway. </p>



<blockquote><p> The sovereign is the point of indistinction between violence and law, the threshold on which violence passes over into law and law passes over into violence.  </p><cite>— Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer</cite></blockquote>



<p>The crypto partisan is a new figure of history, someone who is beyond the physical realm and was produced from a series of extreme techniques of war in order to create perfect forward secrecy for the protect of one&#8217;s physical security. Such a power could only be created when the technicity of cryptography had reached such a zenith that it became a permeant feature for secure communications, which in turn could create economic security. Once this technique was globally disseminated, it was only a matter of time before the core values of cryptography would start to assert their real personal, economic, and social value against other such false non-values positioned by an old and dying society that will not relinquish its bloody authority.  </p>



<p>Schmitt, in reflecting on the nature of this technicity stated, </p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Pure technicity, as obtained in such purely technological reflections, produces no theory of the partisan, but only an optimistic or pessimistic series of more or less powerful assertions of value and non-value. Value, as Ernst Forsthoff aptly put it, has &#8220;its own logic,&#8217; namely, the logic of non-value and the destruction of the bearer of non-value.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p. 77</cite></blockquote>



<p>This quote can only offer its full understanding after reading the short essay, &#8220;The Tyranny of Values.&#8221; By understanding Bitcoin as a form of value that demands to assert itself against non-value through the total security of cryptography by being beyond any law, we can understand the need for Bitcoin to destroy fiat money because of the inherit non-value it must contain. Here is a longer quote explaining this &#8220;value-setting&#8221; and its antagonistic nature:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The genuinely subjective freedom of value-setting leads, however, to an endless struggle of all against all, to an endless bellum omnium contra omnes. In such circumstances, the very presuppositions about a ruthless human nature on which Thomas Hobbes’ philosophy of the state rests, seem quite idyllic by comparison. The old gods rise from their graves and fight their old battles on and on, but disenchanted and, as we today must add, with new fighting means that are no longer weapons, but rather abominable instruments of annihilation and processes of extermination, horrible products of value-free science and of the technology and industrial production that follow suit. What for one is the Devil is God for the other…It always happens that values stir up strife and keeps enmity alive. The fact that the debunked old gods have become merely valorized values only renders the struggle more ghostlike and the fighters hopelessly dogmatic.”</p><cite>&#8211;ToP. p. 79</cite></blockquote>



<p>To display the real wealth that Bitcoin contains, both as a system of rules which is the Bitcoin blockchain and the monetary system it contains; it must assert its superiority as a money and contract system against fiat money and state legal systems antagonistically. Bitcoin does this by presenting its inviolable nature against any and all state legal systems, and Bitcoin&#8217;s total indifference to them. The most important feature of this indifference is akin to a flower in the darkest of night. Despite the seemingly total darkness, there is still a secret, natural heliotropism towards the direction of the night from which sunlight must come which the flower will always turn to before any light may be seen.  </p>



<p>Bitcoin presents a new form of value through cryptography which assures and proves itself in this fallen world where money has been totally corrupted by the state. The &#8216;value&#8217; of fiat money today is little more than political approval to spend one&#8217;s money how one wishes. Fiat money is a form of value that is devoid of real wealth because of it lacks true property rights&#8211;fiat money can always be seized by the state, for whatever reason they see fit. It is a kind of false value that can only find value within the confines of law, and not beyond it. </p>



<p>With the wide dissemination of strong encryption techniques, and the miraculous gift that is Bitcoin, there is hope for something radically and fundamentally different from the false value of fiat money. The possibly to resist the totalitarian surveillance machine with these revolutionary tactics of cryptography has already been initiated, and this should be understood as the natural development of &#8216;crypto&#8217; for the episteme it is. </p>



Legality and Legitimacy 



<p>This is the title of his 1932 essay on the topic of legality and legitimacy. In this essay where Schmitt predicted the fall of the Weimar Republic, and the seizure of power by either the Nazis or the communist due the the failings that are inherent to liberal constitutionalism itself. Schmitt understood that through trying to integrate enemies under the great umbrella of parlamentarism, it created the very conditions for its own downfall. This parlamentarism denies the enmity between peoples who no longer seek to negotiate freedoms with one another; but wish to actively suppress one another using the state.  </p>



<p>Schmitt gave himself over to the Nazis, and was even the mouthpiece of explaining Hitler&#8217;s actions during the The Night of Long Knives. In explaining this action (taking a clear nod towards Mussolini&#8217;s actions in the Matteotti Crisis) Schmitt gave the judicial explanation which cleared the way for fascism in Germany to seize hold. The method of how this happened clearly has infected our current legal system, and is the method by which the law has been destroyed through its stratification. </p>



<p>This was my point in the sovereign, the subject, and crypto-power.  We are no longer citizens that are subject to the law, but are already captured within a framework where we will never gain access to the law by possibility of being an &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217;. Through the labeling of &#8216;enemy of the state,&#8217; the state can turn anyone into a nemesis that cannot be given access to the law, but only a terrorist to be deprived of it.</p>



<p>Schmitt revisits this idea in ToP, which displays the important connection of legality and legitimacy to the partisan and the legitimization of his idea of just war. </p>



<p>Without the legitimacy of a political movement to which the partisan can be attached; his actions are simply crime, and the revolutionary nature of his work can always be relegated to the criminal world. However, it is once his actions as a soldier of war have been linked to that of a political movement, that the final Clausewitzian turn can be fulfilled with, &#8220;war being the continuation of political by other means.&#8220;</p>



<p>In order for the crypto partisan to move beyond that of the meager hacker and criminal, he must link up with and legitimize his movement with other contemporary political movements. He must create known and open political objectives for his movement with a general understanding of who the real enemy is. In short, the crypto-partisan must find his natural allies through political movements which demand the full recognition of who the enemy is, what their violations are, and what must be done to remit such damages. </p>



The Real Enemy



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The enemy is not someone who, for some reason or other, must be eliminated and destroyed because he has no value. The enemy is on the same level as I am. For this reason, I must fight him to the same extent and within the same bounds as he fights me, in order to be constant with the definition of the real enemy by which he defines me.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p.85</cite></blockquote>



<p>It must be understood the the enemy is a limited character. The enemy only defines himself insofar that we both desire to end hostilities and creates some means of peaceable agreement between us. This is the bracketing effect of modern war that Schmitt starts ToP with, speaks about how the bracketing of Napoleonic wars allowed for the Concert of Europe and the century of &#8216;peace&#8217; that came from that. This bracketing of war, is what has allowed for states to stop distracting themselves with fighting each other, and to turn to look at their own citizens as the absolute enemy. </p>



From The Real Enemy to The Absolute Enemy 



<p>The real enemy is each of our respective governments against each of us as individual human beings. They have become the absolute enemy because they will not recognize the absolute protection that the law demands for each and every being if its weight is to have any real meaning beyond raw authoritarian power.  </p>



<p>As Schmitt has said, &#8220;Tell me who your enemy is and I will tell you who you are.&#8221; Through each of us just having the possibility of being the absolute enemy (the terrorist) of whatever state that may claim us, we should clearly understand who our government are to us, and who we are to them. </p>



<p>Through the destruction of all forms of privacy via the technological machine of the internet, a panopticon of the greatest order has been created. Each person today is identified and cataloged by the state, with each one of us placed in a persistent zone of indistiction that holds each of us eternally to be constantly appraised as friend or enemy.  It is the fulfillment of the prophecy that, “To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. </p>



<p>To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality.&#8220;</p>



<p>It must be clear and present to everyone who is involved in crypto that what is being created here is not about grandeur, decadence, or even money; but it is about raw and naked political power through economic liberty, and the right of every human has to such power. It has only been over the long course of the failures of the political systems of the 20th century and the continual barbarism of constant wars under which all of humanity has toiled and suffered that it has became apparent that this is the fundamental destiny of man under any modren nation-state and its corrupt and hopeless law of the wicked and damned. </p>



<p>With the radical technological expansion of the internet and the dissemination of its new techniques of knowledge in the 21st century, it was only a matter of time before the truth of all things would come to people everywhere, and the hatred and enmity that goes with such a truth. Only with a true understanding of the facts of economic and monetary history of the world do we also understand who the absolute enemy really is. With the revolutionary economic tool of bitcoin at our disposal and the radical protection of the cryptography it contains, it is only a matter of time before the final epoch of the cyphernet opens to swallow everything. </p>

  ♦In Pine Effect<p>Azteco and Second Generation Bitcoin wallet Pine are working together to bring the new service category “Consumer Bitcoin” to the public. Combining Pine’s best in class, “Apple Grade” user experience with Azteco’s frictionless delivery creates a compelling offering to Bitcoin newcomers.</p><p>“Second Generation” or “Consumer Bitcoin” wallets are here, and one of the first and best is Pine, a new wallet developed by Timothy Engqvist Johansson.</p>A Little History…<p>Encryption in chat was brought to over 300,000,000 daily users through WhatsApp. Before that, the billions of messages sent by the vast majority of chat apps were easy to read in transit and not private.</p><p>There were a few previous attempts to encrypt chat through apps that worked as privacy tools, but it took a “Consumer Grade” messaging app to bring this essential feature to hundreds of millions of users.</p><p>The same effects will happen in Bitcoin services with, and it’s all about usability; an app or a class of “Consumer First” app will emerge that is designed to fit the needs of consumers, and that wallet and service will sweep the entire world as WhatsApp did.</p>What is Pine?<p>Pine is a Bitcoin App. Using Pine is beautifully simple. Get the app, select a username and you’re ready to start using Bitcoin.</p><p>That’s it.</p><p>Now watch how simple getting Bitcoin can be…</p>medium.com/media/71d406aec09abfcfcef946d8b441dee1/href<p>There’s nothing to set up. You’re up and running instantly. Painless, non-intimidating, zero configuration. And no Bitcoin addresses. This is essential for consumers, and it’s why apps like WhatsApp and others spread virally. You send messages to a contact not a number.</p>♦Cappuccio’s at London’s Liverpool Street. Bitcoin as a part of everyday life.<p>Imagine the following scenario. Jane is curious about Bitcoin, and on her lunch break, she buys an Azteco Voucher from Cappuccio’s to see what Bitcoin is like.</p><p>At the bottom of the voucher is an instruction to download Pine. Pine is ready in less than a minute. She points Pine at the QR on the voucher. It redeems instantly to her Pine wallet.</p><p>That’s all there is to it.</p><p>Before taking a third bite of her toasted Panini, she has been converted into a Bitcoiner. Now that she is on-boarded with a small amount of Bitcoin, she can explore other aspects of Pine and Bitcoin. If she decides to, she can go through the procedure of writing down her Mnemonic in a quiet moment at home, and not in the street.</p><p>Pine redeems Azteco vouchers without requiring the user to interact. It just works, just like Apple’s ground breaking UX and applications get out of your way so you can do your work, or in the case of Pine and Azteco, use Bitcoin.</p><p>Pine moves processes into logical positions in the on-boarding workflow so people can get things done. This is Consumer Centric Design, and it’s the way the vast majority of people using Bitcoin will experience it.</p><p>The other aspects of Pine’s design are also Consumer Centric:</p>♦People are at the centre of Pine, just as they are in other“Instant Messaging” apps. Treating Bitcoin as a form of IM unlocks all the UX opportunities of those applications, and their ability to make an application go viral, sweeping along Bitcoin with it.<p>Payments appear the same way that instant message history timelines do; each contact has it’s own “chat log” only the chats are money. This is instantly familiar and also a fitting metaphor for Bitcoin, which is a messaging service like Messenger and WhatsApp, but with an important twist; the messages can be used as money.</p>♦The familiar timeline metaphor; instantly familiar, comfortable.<p>The vast majority of people experience hard fought for and well engineered security in messaging apps as invisible layers. The instant on-boarding, seamless user experience and zero friction activation in Consumer Bitcoin apps will build on that work to preserve your privacy whilst keeping everything light, easy to use and trivial to understand.</p>Spreading Pine, One Voucher at a Time<p>At the bottom of each voucher Azteco issues, there is a call to action to users to install Pine. As Azteco spreads Bitcoin throughout the global market via its vouchers, it will also spread Pine, which in turn will spread Bitcoin through it’s viral address book leverage. This in turn will create greater demand for Azteco Vouchers, as they are the easiest way to get Bitcoin into Pine.</p><p>As Azteco spreads, our vouchers will be redeemed in different contexts and gateways, pushing the Bitcoin exactly where users want it to go.

  <p>Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve gone through the Economics 11: Principles of Economics course on saifedean.com. In this article, I’m going to review the class, what I think about it and who I think it’s good for.</p>♦The Austrian Method<p>One of the things that has always attracted me to Austrian economics is that everything is logically deducible and the arguments are very clearly laid out where other schools of economic thought hand wave to various conclusions.</p><p>That said, one of the frustrating things about reading Austrian economics books is that they do seem to spend a lot of time on technical objections that are confusing for a new student and lay things out in a way that require a lot of rigor. That is, they’re not exactly learning-friendly. It’s not easy, for example, to get through Menger or Mises or even Rothbard without feeling like there are entire parts that you missed.</p>Saifdean Ammous’s Approach<p>The strength of the offering that Saifedean has put together is that the course is very much focused on helping you learn. As he brings up, a lot of the books like Human Action or Principles of Economics are meant for academics and for people that are looking to build off of it. What I found refreshing about Saifedean’s course was that it was very much geared toward giving me the principles by which to think about various economics topics.</p><p>There is, for example, a whole lecture just about labor and the scarcity of human time. This is an obvious fact, but the deductions that we can make from that fact can help us understand phenomena like why predictions about certain natural resources running out have nearly always been wrong.</p><p>It’s a much more satisfying way to learn the material as it’s presented in a much more digestible way.</p>Passionate Stories and More<p>If you’ve been paying attention to Saifedean Ammous for a while, you are probably aware of the debates and talks he’s done. He’s a brutal assassin in these debates and his talks can be a bit controversial. You may think that his style may detract from the learning experience, but I found it to be the opposite. He has a clear passion for the subject that he’s teaching which were very easy for me to absorb.</p><p>At one point, he gives a very rational and thorough critique of minimum wage. The same argument could have been given in a stand-offish calculating manner, but his obvious disdain for how illogical minimum wage is and how unjust it is to the very people it purports to help comes through and aids in remembering the argument.</p>Conclusion<p>All this is to say that I really enjoyed the course. If there’s any criticism of it, I wish there was more interactivity and discussion around economic phenomena for practicing this newfound knowledge. That said, there are some forums to encourage student discussion which will hopefully build out over time. I’m definitely going to be buying more courses myself.</p><p>If you are looking to understand economics in a much clearer way and with a better deductive basis, this course is definitely for you. The course is an excellent way to learn the Austrian economics concepts and will help you understand Bitcoin as an economic phenomenon much better.</p>♦

  <p>In regards to why Satoshi picked the “shock” model to issuance decay, I believe (and I’m speculating here) that he wanted to minimize as many dynamic variables in Bitcoin as possible. Having an algorithm recompute issuance on a per-block basis just means more moving parts and more opportunity for exploitation. The halving code is extremely simple and comprehensible. A smooth curve would have been more complex. I haven’t seen any evidence that he deliberately configured it to set off a demand side catalyst every years.</p>♦

  <p>In the final stage of the spectacle society, man has fully corrupted himself and shows himself publicly only as the one-dimensional man. We can say confidently that state totalitarianism has fully captured and enslaved humanity; leaving man as a hollow and vacant object to be exploited and raped for the free use of tyranny, evil, and banal profits alike. In the transition from state totalitarianism to oligopolic empire, power was consolidated through the fusion of automation and the digital panopticon to make the perfect social camps from which the state and their automaton could gaze over all of life. Forever.</p>



<p>Only the murmur of &#8220;arbeit mit frei&#8221; can be heard now, with the private personal truth of, &#8220;durch krematorium nummer drei&#8221; to be echoed in one&#8217;s head as one heads off to work for the day…</p>



<p>In the gravest of errors, the Titans of Technology and Industry did not think that Prometheus would steal the fire from their machine of optical power that would spark the consciousness of their downfall.&nbsp;Their hubris did not allow them to think that man could find his way out of the darkness even with THE most precious of gifts. Armed with this most fundamental of all tools, THE fire/knowledge/power that is the singular technique of power; individual man emerges from the forest of technology prepared to seize that which is rightfully his once again&#8230;</p>



<p>So it once was with the Gods, now it is again. The Gigantomachy starts afresh, the civil war for Right begins anew…</p>







♦The First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea







<blockquote><p>“The oath does not concern the statement as such, but is the guarantor of its efficacy: what is in question is not the semiotical or cognitive functions of language as such but the assurance of its truthfulness and its actualization.”</p><cite>-Giorgio Agamben, The Sacrament of Language</cite></blockquote>



The Oath of the Machines



<p>The Handshake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is the fundamental base from which all machines communicate and exchange information. The handshake is the agreement which governs the code that is their language, the expressions which cannot be divided from the statement. This is the Law of Machines, it is their form-of-life, their code of law, and the handshake is the first of their agreements.</p>



<p>What is at stake in the handshake is the functionality of the code itself is  — there is no other way for the machines to communicate. The language of machines and the voice of the animal have disappeared back into one another as it is with any other animal; except for man.  The voice/language of code is the only method of communication that the machines have; and to have this handshake dishonored in anyway it shipwrecks the whole code before compiling, making it useless from the start. The code must operate with its very being at-stake in order to rending itself operable. That is what makes it code; that is the only way the operations can function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is at stake in handshake is not just the promise of what the codebase renders functional; but also the curse that is enacted when this oath is broken. Preforming the ritual of the handshake incorrectly profanes the communication, as we saw with the heartbleed bug, or other erroneous implementations of cryptographic protocols. However, this does not mean that cryptography itself is broken — in fact, this reinforces the truth of the realness of what cryptography is, and the fragility that is its liturgy.  The mathematical base and liturgical techniques that creates the divine force of cryptography is the same as it always was, and will be, and the errors of men prove it all the more so. </p>



<p>This handshake between machines enables a form-of-life that is committed entirely to itself — the enablement of the code — in which it renders the physical world repugnant. Machines do not have the forked tongue of man that allows for language to abandon itself at the moment of its utterance. The code must actualize its syntactical and linguistic meaning through its oath that the machines make with one another. Thus, this handshake the machines make with one another does not concern the statement as such, but is the guarantor of its efficacy: what is in question is not the semiotical or cognitive functions of language as such but the assurance of its truthfulness and its actualization.</p>



<p>What is at stake in the code of cryptography is the very real act of creating assured private communication through the mathematical ceremony which guarantees the privity of privacy. Through the conjuring or summoning a mathematically assured secret, which verifies our communications are protected by the immanence force of maths through the correct implementation of the ceremony; we create a form of divine mathematical power which no temporal power may violate with any known means today. Through the liturgical process that is the open-sourced reading of the code, and the agreement that is the privity of cryptography to ensure itself beyond all else; cryptography&#8217;s only sworn sovereign to uphold the code itself. It is this oath that the machines take to themselves and their total obligation to it that creates the base that is the liturgy of cryptography. </p>



The Liturgy of Cryptography



<p>Cryptography’s power is created by the liturgical protocols themselves— one cannot compromise the key-generation event, key exchanges, or any of the other nuance techniques that sanctify the event; otherwise the cryptography is rendered useless. But when the rituals of cryptography are exercised with the same piousness as a gnostic priest, what cryptography renders is prophetic: the encryption becomes unbreakable by any known means; and verified by the holy blessings of math. The oath of the machine to itself is actualized through the creation of the real content that is the language of encryption; the liturgical techniques that creates provably secure communications. </p>



<p>The communication is sealed and hedl by God&#8217;s immutable blessing, his inviolable signature. It is this liturgical process of the machines that renders the secret key as a sacrosaint protected by the immanence of a Spinozian God to whom in His ethics of maths there are no exceptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no more sovereign decision; only the crisis that is the truth of all things. </p>



<p>With the language of cryptography each unique mnemonic private key is like the utterance of the holy names of God in private prayer. It is the tetragrammaton of secrets themselves and the hidden power that is created through concealment itself. The creation of a private key is sacred and holy insofar that it is a singular linguistic experience in which we offer ourselves towards another form of sacral linguistic power for protection through ritualized discourse with the machine. Through the specific arrangement of words that are totally unique to a singular moment, place, and time in space&#8211;the chances of which are beyond 2^256 — we can confidently say this number will never in all of human existence be produced ever again. However, to prove God&#8217;s glory all the more, we cannot say it is impossible, for a throw of the dice will never abolish chance. </p>



<p>It is this spectacular, seemingly unbreakable power found in crypto that is the very proof of the immanence of a God who loves humanity so spectacularly, he produced into the world this new kind of social agreement that is beyond any violence or law through code and cryptography alone.  With this power he can change everything. </p>



Saint Satoshi



<p>Through delivering us a man/woman/person/group so thoughtful, magnanimous, and graceful as whoever Satoshi may have been, the promise of a new age has been given to us. From their promethean effort alone, and their willingness to walk away from greatest amount of wealth any single man/woman/person/group has ever created; Satoshi created the final sacrifice the machine demanded to create its inoperativity for its messianic task.</p>



<p>Satoshi, through the sacrifice of walking away from the machine of power that is Bitcoin he created the final assurance that there would be no more third-party security holes. Through his work, and ability to abscond back into the digital sphere without a trace of his physical being, proved the power of this mathematical technique of the power of concealment. </p>



<p>Cryptography creates a kind of mathematical seal so powerful that nearly nothing could break it&#8211;that is proven as well. It is a power from a Spinozian God hidden behind a thousand and one faces, laughing the whole way as a Loki trickster God, understanding the butt of the joke the whole time from His timeless vantage point beyond all things. </p>



<p>Seeing the concourse of human history and the utter barbarism that it has been only for it to lead up to now and to be given this final weapon of cryptography seems to be only divine providence. To be at a time and place of such utter Kafkaesque darkness, the total corruption of the law, justice, and money; only to have this tool of Bitcoin present itself is beyond extraordinary, and seemingly messianic. </p>



<p>This is the decrypting of cryptography for its immanence and personal power for what it really is: unique, true, and untouchable by man and totally indifferent to the world of flesh and steel. Here no one else can gain entry, since this entrance was assigned only to you. I’m going now to close it.</p>



The Messianism of Bitcoin



<p>Through the gift and ēvangelium of a non-violent, encrypted, pseudonymous, P2P global cash with a fixed known unitary supply; there is the possibility for a form-of-life that is beyond the barbarism and violence of all nation-states, and the horrors they will always entail. Bitcoin has created a spectacular bloom of ideas&#8211;that which is now called crypto&#8211;and all of the concepts and hopes that are being deployed and are unfurling outwards towards the final destination of radical, unadulterated freedom through cryptography. Soon these ideas that cannot be stopped will engulf the whole world in flames as the new civil war for Right begins anew, demanding from each of us to choose if a sovereign will rule over each of us; or if we are to have something totally new&#8230;</p>



<p>With these new techniques of power, anyone can mimetically create mathematical proofs that are so complex, so unique it can be said that number only exist in that single key generation event ever! It is as unique to the cosmos as atoms are to their place in the universe. We can take comfort and faith in the knowing that this sacred number shall most likely never be produced again. </p>



<p>Here is where our faith must engage too, for we cannot say it is impossible; just the proof of what we know to be true about this cryptographic proof, and the evidence of it as such. And for the truth, and goodness of this open-sourced discussion, and for the ethics it has and applies for the desire to provide us with some semblance of privacy as a right, we find a new cause. </p>



<p>Here, hidden in the depths of this technology, we find the messianic promise of cryptography, and what the sacrament of the oath means to the machines when they are bonded to it. Through fusing these two concepts&#8211;the oath of the machines, and the liturgy of cryptography&#8211; into an economic theorem, Satoshi created a new form of power that is beyond the temporal and telluric nature of all nation-states. It is an organizational form of power that opens a new topography of war through the most informational and oblique way possible.  </p>



<p>It is a most clever and graceful system of both cryptographic and economic design to trap man into a grand political-economic game where his own forked tongue as a liar and a crook acts as his final testimony against a corrupt society, broken laws, forsaken money, and wicked politics which yields only ash and sorrow. Through creating a new form of social contract which creates a new form of wealth through the power, utility, and fairness of Bitcoin, the promise it offers and the oath it must entail; Bitcoin opens an economic strategy towards a messianic new world. </p>



<p>Here is the opening for a new epoch, perhaps even the final epoch from where a new kind of time can rule, but never reign. It is a handshake with the Word of God, and the final agreement for the Truth of all things to unveil their being in order to build towards the final moment of this epoch. The Katechon will unveil itself to be the nation-state and its war for total control of all things, and what that means for each of us in our final moments before the demands of such a power. It is the very summoning of the apocalypse itself so the final existential crisis of state, law, and man may begin, so that the possibility of something totally and radically new may be possible and produced. This current system of laws and debt bondage will not save us; so let us do it for ourselves. </p>



<p>When we take position of the personal power found in Bitcoin and the ability to reclaim our wealth; the real state of emergency will begin. It where law completely abandons every human for the raw fascist power of the machine, and the totalizing demand for all humans to submit to it in the name, &#8220;Society must be defended!&#8221; Here we can find the final power to close the door to law, to turn away from it, and be freed from it for good by stating, as Satoshi taught us &#8220;I would prefer not to.&#8220;</p>



<p>By creating a new form-of-life through the means and mode of these new tools of crypto, and the economic liberation of Bitcoin specifically; we can build the strategy towards a totally private life that is removed from the temporal powers of any state. It is a life that is beyond the the world of flesh and steel, and opens us to a life that is beyond this physical space of wrath and tears. Through the promise of what Bitcoin is and the sacrifice that Satoshi made by walking away from the greatest sum of money any human has ever created, he initiated the final machine from which the state can be destroyed bloodlessly, and without violence. As the Ubermench of our time, Satoshi is the first citizen of the Cyphernet, and the final criminal of all nation-states by the messianic task of what the creation of bitcoin means today. </p>



<p>Through this action of creating Bitcoin and walking away, Satoshi gave us a methodology to turn away from the door of law and the power of the state in order to return to the country and nature from which we came. It is here where we find the fortitude to abandon the hope of the law to save us, that we also find the schilling point from which the multitude will meet for humanities final judgement on the criminal, and to abandon state law once and for all. It is a most wonderful creation for the liberation of all of humanity, and a hope for a future free of tyranny for the whole of the humanity leaving no exception or remainder for anything else. It is the final promise from a form of grace, love, and knowledge so powerful that it would give any individual the total power over their wealth for any reason, no matter what. It is something so wonderful and miraculous in our time and age, that it can only be called messianic for that which it promises to enable, and the nomos that it wishes to restore. </p>

  <p>Thank you Tomer! I am of the same mind. I don’t believe you have to deny the EMH to be excited about the long term prospects of Bitcoin. I think of it a bit like Amazon early in its life. All available information was reflected in the stock price, but it still appreciated a great deal as it grew into an ecommerce behemoth. A few committed investors were just more optimistic on Bezos’ ability to swallow that market than the market consensus was at the time. Similarly, the world thinks Bitcoin should be worth about $150b. For a variety of reasons I think this is a conservative view! But again, I don’t find this to be incompatible with efficient markets generally.</p>♦

  <p>Hi Steven Yang, Thank you for your feedback.</p><p>I believe they are intrinsically linked, influence each other and mean revert.</p><p>Having some of the greatest investments in Bitcoin, the miners represent a large portion of the “smart money” in Bitcoin, and their actions should be considered closely.</p><p>For Your Scenario</p><p>If half the miners were to suddenly leave Bitcoin, it would represent a massive issue to the Bitcoin network. They would be abandoning Bitcoin for another coin, a better computing prospect or due to clear issue with the Bitcoin code / network itself.</p><p>In other words, they would be abandoning Bitcoin because they see:</p><ul><li>a greater future prospect (Demand) for another asset (which would likely mean a reduced future demand for Bitcoin), or</li><li>a great risk facing Bitcoin, which will likely reduce consumer demand for Bitcoin in the near future.</li></ul><p>Assuming the miners are correct, reducing future demand (with supply growth constant — which it is) would cause the price to drop.</p><p>Further, this major miner exodus would likely result in these Miners (and other retail investors watching the event occur) dumping their Bitcoin and pushing price down out of fear.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Difficulty would get adjusted down after 2 weeks. The existing Miners (if they are not jumping ship by now also) would then be receiving double as many Bitcoins. I assume there would be greater likelihood of the existing miners selling their extra coins (not hording them) due to the impending threat to the network, and in attempt to de-risk. This would further drive down price.</p><p>There may be a short-term arbitrage opportunity for new miners to start mining Bitcoin when they see the hash rate / difficulty half. Hash Rate historically increases ~100–200% per year. Assuming Bitcoin was not compromised (and 50% of the Miners got the dire prediction wrong) new Bitcoin mining operations could set up shop and have a greater profit margin for maximum 6–12 months. However, it is worth noting that to compete today you need a professional set up (average Bitcoin electricity cost is 4.5c/kWh globally). To set up a meaningful operation, you would need to establish a facility, hardware and electricity contract in often remote areas. Who would be taking this making this substantial investment, for a potential 6- month opportunity, when a massive Bitcoin threat / exodus is occurring? Particularly when the existing Miners are during this time likely dumping their excess coin revenue, further dropping the price. In other words, by the time a new operation could be set up to capture the theoretical opportunity, price will likely have collapsed.</p><p>within 2 weeks, eliminating any arbitrage opportunity within 2 weeks (I doubt any meaningful mining operation would set up in this time to take advantage of that).</p><p>Other Evidence of Mining Energy Leading Price</p><p>Outside of this scenario, there are several clear instances where Energy Value lead price historically, such as the major drops in 2016 and 2019.</p><p>This is also supported by the effectiveness of the Hash Ribbons indicator (see article “Hash Ribbons and Bitcoin Bottoms”).</p><p>Energy Value provides an insight into Bitcoin’s Demand from a Miner “smart money” perspective and this can be very helpful in the chaos of retail market fluctuations — particularly given it is calculated completely independently of price.</p>♦

  <p>Thanks for the comment. Agreed on virtually everything. There’s a reason I devote 80% of my time and energy to Bitcoin! Nothing that I’m aware of has a meaningful chance of catching up, especially where it counts (on credibility, fairness, the nature of the bitcoin ‘institution’ so to speak). Bitcoin is also the product of another time — one in which cryptocurrency wasn’t a mainstream idea, so no big hedge funds tried to frontrun mainstream adoption. This is an amazing quality. For the first couple years, the coins became to enthusiasts on a totally organic basis. This is such a powerful advantage.</p><p>In fact, my skepticism about launches is part of the reason I sat on this article for so long. I just couldn’t think of a reason anyone would want to launch a new coin, or why the world would need yet another coin.</p><p>However, there are a lot of unknown unknowns out there. I didn’t want to entirely write off new launches. I am sure there will be some good ideas in the future — maybe not for general cryptocurrencies, so to speak, but there may be cause to launch a new PoW blockchain. Who knows. If there indeed are new launches, I figured it would be better for the issuers to have access to my complete thoughts on the topic, as I have spent a lot of time thinking about launch methods over the years.</p>♦

  Size Does Matter — Part 4A Philosophy of Securities Laws for Tokenized Networks♦“Sufficiently Decentralized” — a Safe Harbor?<p>Recap of Past Parts+ Introduction</p><ul><li>In Part 1, I summarized the current state of the blockchain industry and attributed much of its troubles to conflicts of interest, contradictions and suboptimal path dependencies arising from securities law avoidance tactics. I suggested that the primary function of tokens is serving as “shares of network equity” which are bought for investment purposes and allow the value of an open network to be shared by its community without the network being owned or controlled by anyone.</li><li>In Part 2, I gave you a crash course in the Exchange Act…which is what requires securities issuers who meet the “size matters” test to become SEC-reporting companies. I described how many such disclosure rules are useful and typically do not prohibit positive transactions.</li><li>In Part 3, I showed how the Exchange Act would apply to a specific hypothetical token seller, the Power Foundation (which developed PowerChain / PowerCoin) and discussed the pros and cons of the resulting reporting obligations with attention to preserving the merits of open network technology.</li></ul><p>Now, in this Part 4, comes what some might consider the good stuff…I will provide a complete framework for understanding how and why securities laws apply to open network tokens, and when they cease doing so.</p><p>This is commonly misunderstood and much speculated about topic. I happen to think I have a better take on it than pretty much anyone, and I am eager to dispel some myths and try to set the conversation going in a more positive direction that will enable the tokenized open network to thrive.</p><p>A Brief History of the SEC’s “Mutation Doctrine”</p>♦Whoah take it easy broh, if you keep adding Hinman factors to these tokens you’re gonna get some gnarly mutations!!!<p>Starting with its 21(a) report on TheDAO in the summer of 2017, the SEC declared war on ICOs, spreading waves of paranoia through the ether of a tokenphoric blockchain industry. These “bad vibes” didn’t cancel the party, but they hurt — like the first, faint tension in the jaw and temples at the start of a bad comedown.</p><p>Not long after, the SEC took action against the issuers of RECoin and PlexCoin, but these were fraudulent offerings, not merely unregsitered securities sales.</p><p>Cryptolawyers propounded various theories, none of which turned out to be very good. Some thought the SEC was only targeting fraudulent offerings. Others, that the sole reason tokens could be deemed to be securities is because words like “investment” were used in the Whitepaper, and if one just avoided those words, there would be no problem at all — this was called the “manner of sale” theory. The deeply misguided SAFT Whitepaper was published, and a group of lawyers, one being particularly handsome and fashionable, published a critique of that. It seemed there was a new pet theory every week.</p><p>Still, the party raged on. There was Kik/KIN, SIRIN and more.</p><p>And so SEC Chairman Jay Clayton was all like:</p>♦He’s not angry, he just has a really bad case of RRF (resting regulator face)<p>In December, the SEC announced its first settlement in connection with a clearly non-fraudulent ICO, that of Muchee Inc. It was meant to send a message: no, we’re not only targeting frauds and yes, your “pure utility” token can still be a security.</p><p>On February 28, 2018, shit got real: The NYTimes published a story “Subpoenas Signal S.E.C. Crackdown on Initial Coin Offerings” reporting that SEC subpoenas regarding ICOs “had gone out to as many as 80 companies and individuals”. At the same time, many U.S. state securities regulators began their own subpoenas and investigations. This sent the industry into a panic, and undoubtedly contributed to the steady decline of prices from January 2018’s highs in the coming months.</p><p>On June 14, 2018, amidst rumors that the SEC might be about to make a major announcement about either XRP or ETH (with many fearing the announcement would be a major lawsuit), came an unexpected lifeline: Gary Hinman’s speech “Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic)”.</p><p>Hinman was (and, as of the date of this writing, still is) the Director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance . He started the speech by discussing that tokens could represent investment contracts when they are sold as part of an investment by promoters to develop an enterprise. Then, he dropped a bombshell few could have predicted:</p><blockquote>If the network on which the token or coin is to function is sufficiently decentralized — where purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts — the assets may not represent an investment contract. . .</blockquote><blockquote>[P]utting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions. . .[A]pplying the disclosure regime of the federal securities laws to current transactions in Ether would seem to add little value.</blockquote><p>Hinman concluded the speech with a list of factors that should be considered in determining whether “sufficient decentralization” has been achieved and thus whether mutation of the token from security to non-security has occurred.</p><p>At the time, this speech was HUGE: The head of one of the most important SEC divisions was specifically confirming that he did not view ETH as a security. And he was doing so as part of enunciating a broader doctrine of “sufficient decentralization” or “mutability” stating that a token that initially represents a security can mutate into a non-security.</p><p>Much buzz and gossip instantly ensued, mixed with considerable optimism and relief. Upon reflection, Hinman’s speech appeared astonishing — because it was more cypherpunk than the prior positions of most cryptolawyers! Here was a U.S. regulator, a normie among normies, a buttoned-up securities attorney, who was saying that technologies and the people working on them will receive an extra privilege in the form of lighter regulation if they do what blockchains are supposed to do — decentralize power. No one expected such an anarchist-friendly result to emanate from the SEC!</p><p>In the coming days, weeks and months, much speculation ensued regarding whether or to what extent the SEC officially embraced Hinman’s speech. The first confirmatory evidence came in the form of rumors that the SEC staff was asking token issuers to provide memos explaining how a given token fared under the Hinman Factors. Then on March 17, 2019, additional confirmation appeared in a letter from SEC Chairman Jay Clayton to U.S. House Representative Ted Budd, stating in relevant part as follows:</p><blockquote>Your letter also asks whether I agree with certain statements concerning digital tokens in Director Hinman’s June 2018 speech. I agree that the analysis of whether a digital asset is offered or sold as a security is not static and does not strictly inhere to the instrument. A digital asset may be offered and sold initially as a security because it meets the definition of an investment contract, but that designation may change over time if the digital asset later is offered and sold in such a way that it will no longer meet that definition. I agree with Director Hinman’s explanation of how a digital asset transaction may no longer represent an investment contract if, for example, purchasers would no longer reasonably expect a person or group to carry out the essential managerial or entrepreneurial efforts. Under those circumstances, the digital asset may not represent an investment contract under the Howey framework.</blockquote><p>Finally, Hinman’s stance was further confirmed and clarified in the SEC’s official Framework for “Investment Contract” Analysis of Digital Assets published on April 3, 2019. Similarly to Clayton’s letter, the Framework clarified that the “sufficiently decentralized” test is not a rewrite of the Howey test, but merely a gloss on the Howey test. The level of decentralization of a network or its technology leadership was relevant to determining whether whether the fourth prong of the Howey test was met in the context of open network tokens initially sold as investments.</p><p>With that added context, Hinman’s approach looked less like the radical new “mutability doctrine” that some had feared and others craved, and more like a sensible extension of the Howey test and fundamental principles of securities laws, but tailored to the somewhat unusual context of tokenized open blockchain networks.</p><p>Basically, what the SEC is saying is this: In order to determine whether there is reliance on the efforts of others and whether the token is thus an investment contract and a security, one must also ask what kind of others are contemplated to be making these efforts, and what kind of efforts those others are making. Only, says the SEC (repeating case law), if the efforts of others are “the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise, as opposed to efforts that are more ministerial in nature,” will the token be an investment contract and thus a security.</p><p>When there is “sufficient decentralization,” with multiple unaffiliated persons/groups adding value to the project, and the network and software operating without a central authority, there no longer are such “others” and they are no longer making such “efforts.” A token then cease to be an investment in some group of affiliated people or an entity — it becomes an investment in a kind of live, ever-evolving, community-run enterprise that is owned by no one and dependent on nothing other than incentives and game theory. Therefore, it no longer make sense for the securities laws to apply.</p><p>The remainder of this article will be an attempt to flesh out what “sufficient decentralization” really means in more detail, and to propose a “safe harbor” the SEC could approve to clarify the doctrine more.</p><p>PowerCoin.

It is intended to provide some details that flesh out when I think I a token project could become “sufficiently decentralized,” but not every detail is important.</p><p>Let’s check in with our favorite project, PowerCoin. You will recall from Part 3 that PowerCoin was designed by a “prototypical blockchain foundation”, the Power Foundation. As we concluded then, around the time of the token sale and network launch, PowerCoins should be viewed as representing securities (specifically, investment contracts) and the Power Foundation should be viewed as a “reporting company” under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.</p><p>Let’s assume the Power Foundation has a smart and handsome protocol droid like lex_node as a lawyer, gets good advice and does the right thing —converts to PowerCorp (a public benefit corporation expressly permitted to make decisions for the benefit of not just its stockholders but also PowerCoin holders and other community participants). PowerCorp registers as a reporting company and files all its 10-Qs, 10-Ks, 8-Ks, 14-As, etc. on time.</p><p>Now what? Let’s fast-forward two years in time:</p><ul><li>all of the advertised features of PowerCoin and PowerChain referred to in the ICO Whitepaper have at least arguably been completed — in particular, the hotly anticipated “DAPP-mining” feature is in full swing and has been accompanied by a steady rise in PowerCoin price as more and more DAPPs choose PowerChain</li><li>however, there are rumors of potential future upgrades and many ideas for what those upgrades might look like — PowerCorp contributes to those discussions and is starting some research into the possibilities, but many others are also doing so on an independent basis</li><li>PowerCoin now trades on a many exchanges, including mainstream exchanges like CoinbaseSTONKS (for securities coins)</li><li>PowerCoin is widely distributed among many types of holders (speculators, users, institutional investors, mom &amp; pops) and is a top 15 coin by market cap</li><li>PowerCorp has burned through its original $50M raise and continues to fund itself through sales of its treasury PowerCoins (either in unregistered private placements or pursuant to SEC-registered or SEC-qualified offerings — remember, PowerCoins are securities!)</li><li>MegaZord continues to be the most popular PowerChain network client, but several other good clients written in different languages — ViperZord (Python), NinjaZord (Rust) and FrappucinoZord (Javascript)— now exist and are gaining traction; MegaZord’s “market share” (percentage of nodes on the network) has declined from 100% to an average of about 60%; all the code of all of these clients is open-source</li></ul>♦actual footage of Zord clients syncing on the PowerChain network<ul><li>MegaZord is now maintained by a team of 30 developers, 20 of which are directly employed full-time by PowerChain, and the rest of which are comprised of a mix of independent contractors who receive periodic grants from PowerCorp, and volunteers who work on the client out of interest and to gain experience</li><li>about six months after the PowerChain launch, several early investors and employees of PowerCorp split off from PowerCorp and started Ranger Inc.</li><li>Ranger is a “RedHat for PowerChain”: it developed and maintains the second most popular PowerChain network client, ViperZord, does enterprise consulting work for bigger companies interested in building on PowerChain, and supplies important infrastructure boosters and tools for the PowerChain community, like testing suites, powerful network nodes that can be accessed for a fee, etc.;</li><li>the current tokenomics are as follows:</li><li>— -&gt;PowerCorp and its “insiders” (more on definition below) own 5% of currently existing PowerCoins</li><li>— →Ranger and its “insiders” own 3% of currently existing PowerCoins</li><li>— -&gt;the rest of tokens are dispersed among the public</li><li>the operations of the network are widely decentralized; many unaffiliated DAPP teams are contributing to the new DAPP-mining process; in addition, GPU-based PoW mining continues as a backstop and such mining can be done by any recently manufactured GPU; it is believed that miners are widely geographically distributed, though professional GPU-based mining operations have started clustering in regions with cheap energy and/or tax breaks</li></ul><p>Is PowerCoin Still a Security?</p><p>So, this is the big question. I have designed the above facts to not be completely clear about the answer but still clear enough that I would be pretty confident that the PowerChain ecosystem has become “sufficiently decentralized” such that PowerCoin should no longer be considered a security. Part of the reason for any hesitation at all, I think, is just the fact that no set of hypothetical facts written down in bullet points can match the richness of reality, and I could imagine supplemental facts that could change my mind: For example, if all of the equityholders of PowerCorp and Ranger Inc. are secretly tightly affiliated so that effectively PowerCorp and Ranger Inc. are functioning as one entity disguised as two.</p><p>That being said, I want to explain what mental models and implicit tests I am using to decide that PowerCoin is no longer a security. I believe they are the same tests that are being used (or should be used) by the SEC or any judge to decide this issue.</p><p>There are really two tests, working together:</p><ul><li>a doctrinal test, rooted in the Howey test, that shows the investment contract has been performed and has thus expired in accordance with its terms, so PowerCoins should no longer be regulated as securities</li><li>a policy-driven test, rooted in the fundamentals of corporate law, agency law and securities law principles, that shows there is no longer a separation between ownership of the PowerCoin network and control of the PowerCoin network, so from a policy perspective applying the securities laws no longer makes sense</li></ul><p>These tests are premised on slightly different — but potentially compatible — theories of what “sufficient decentralization” means and why it is important.</p><p>Test 1 — Sufficient Decentralization Is Simply Completion of the Original Investment Contract, Which Then Ceases to Exist</p><ol><li>Summary of Test</li></ol><p>Here is a doctrinal, Howey-based argument for why PowerCoins have stopped being securities:</p><ul><li>PowerCoins were securities (to be more precise, securities instruments) because they represented investment contracts</li><li>When an investment contract is fully performed by the seller, it expires</li><li>When a contract expires, any transferable instruments that used to represent that contract cease to do so</li><li>The investment contract formed at the time of the PowerCoin token sale and any subsequent sales has been fully performed by PowerCorp</li><li>Therefore, the investment contract has expired</li><li>Therefore, PowerCoins no longer represent that investment contract — there is no investment contract to represent</li><li>Therefore, PowerCoins are no longer securities (to be more precise, securities instruments)</li></ul><p>2. What is an “Investment Contract,” Really?</p><p>What is an “investment contract”? Let’s really think about this. It is a source of frequent confusion.</p><p>It’s theoretically possible, though virtually never happens in practice, that two parties could purposefully write down and sign an explicit, purposeful investment contract. In the case of a very simple token sale arrangement where the investment contract was to be fully performed at the time of the initial network launch, a cartoon sketch of an explicit investment contract would read sort of like this:</p><blockquote>Token-Seller hereby covenants and agrees, to and for the benefit of Token-Buyer, to use reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as reasonably practicable: (a) develop a fully functioning blockchain technology network complying with the specifications set forth on Exhibit A; and (b) cause Token-Buyer’s designated blockchain address on such network to be pre-populated with 1,000,000 of the native protocol token for such blockchain technology network. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Token-Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that Token-Purchaser is entering into this contract with the understanding and expectation that the the Token-Seller’s efforts hereunder will cause the value of the tokens to be received by Token-Buyer to potentially substantially exceed the price Token-Buyer is paying to purchase such tokens hereunder. Token-Seller hereby agrees that such expectations on the part of Token-Buyer are reasonable.</blockquote><p>If the above contract seems slightly comical, it should — no one actually does that. Indeed, as with most ICOs, it is rare that there is an explicit contract involved in most “investment contract” transactions at all. When there is one, it usually seeks to obfuscate the investment intent and the true terms of the deal rather than clarify them.</p><p>For example, the few ICOs that had explicit contracts typically specified the opposite of what was happening. The “Purchase Agreements” would often say that the tokens were being acquired solely to be “consumed” or “used” like products, with no investment intent whatsoever, and with the seller expressly disclaiming any obligations to build or deliver anything or use any particular efforts to help the buyer achieve profits. The same is true for non-token “investment contracts” — for example, Howey featured a hybrid lease/services contract meant to look like a person was just leasing a plot of land and hiring someone to help grow oranges on it, but it was really an investment contract and hence a securities transaction.</p><p>Thus, what “investment contracts” really are, almost always, is contracts created by the application of a legal rule. Lawyers usually describe this, more confusingly, as “contracts implied as a matter of law”. These are the same thing. When the law implies that a contract exists even though the parties have not observed the requisite formalities, the law is essentially saying that it would be unjust if there were no contract, so a contract is legally deemed or legally required to exist. The contract is a sort of virtual legal object.</p><p>Implied contracts are well known and generally understood in commercial law, and in that context they are relatively intuitive for a non-lawyer to understand. For example, if you and I have a history where I mow your lawn every Saturday, and you give me $20 afterwards, that is a contract implied as a mater of law by course of performance — if one day when I show up and mow the lawn, you do not pay me the $20, I can go to court and prove you breached out contract and I am entitled to $20 in damages. You never said to me “every Saturday that you come and mow my lawn, I’ll pay you $20 in return” and I never said “I accept your offer”, but we didn’t need to: it’s what I understood, and the basis of my understanding was reasonable, so to protect me against injustice the law says that we had a contract, even though we didn’t observe the typical formalities of contract formation like hiring lawyers and writing the terms down. This should seem fair and logical to anyone.</p><p>In the case of an investment contract, its existence and terms are implied as a matter of law from: (1) the general understanding of the buyer (that the buyer reasonably expects profits due to the entrepreneurial efforts of the seller as part of a common enterprise) and (2) the fact that securities laws in the U.S. are non-waivable.</p><p>What “(2)” means is that, under circumstance “(1),” even if you and I enter into a written contract, signed in our blood, that says in all-caps, bold letters, WE HEREBY AGREE, ON PAIN OF DEATH, TO WAIVE ALL THE PROTECTIONS WE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS, AND ASSUME ALL RISKS OF THE RESULTS OF NOT HAVING THOSE PROTECTIONS,” the arrangement will still be an “investment contract. Our attempt at agreeing to the contrary will be unenforceable. Thus, in every situation where “(1)” is true, the law creates an investment contract between the parties.</p><p>3. What is the Relationship Between a Token and an Investment Contract?</p><p>I hear some really weird things said about securities laws by non-lawyers, and even sometimes lawyers, who are trying to understand how securities laws apply to tokens. One can end up falling down some very dark and twisted rabbit holes, such as a recent discussion I had with some non-lawyers about ‘whether ASICs are securities’. Even the SEC does this: in various reports, settlement announcements and complaints, the SEC has occasionally said words to the effect that “tokens are investment contracts.”</p><p>But what does that mean? How can some of kind of tangible or intangible thing — like an ASIC, an orange, a bottle of whiskey or a token— be a contract? Contracts are not things, they are legal abstractions — agreements, understandings.</p><p>Answer: it can’t be.</p><p>Saying that a token is an investment contract, or that a token is a security, is at best an imprecise shorthand, and at worst a category mistake. Yes, I realize I’ve done it too — especially in this article. But that is partly because the actual relationship of tokens to securities has been widely misunderstood, so I’ve had to use the same imprecise shorthands while I work my way to this point, where I can finally try to clarify things.</p><p>Legal abstractions, like all abstractions, have the property that they can be represented in various ways. For example, shares of stock in a corporation can be represented as book entries on a ledger maintained by the corporation, or they can be represented via paper stock certificates; in the latter case, they become more easily transferable on a peer-to-peer basis, without involving the issuer. Similarly, debt arrangements can be represented as promissory notes.</p><p>When a security — which is always a contract (whether express or implied) — is represented via a transferable instrument, we generally call that a securities instrument: stock certificates and promissory notes are examples of securities instruments. The hallmark of a securities instrument is this: by transferring the instrument, one also, as a matter of law, transfers/assigns one’s rights under the relevant contract.</p><p>I contend, then, that the most precise way of understanding the relationship between an open network token and the related investment contract is this: the token represents the investment contract the same way a stock certificate represents a share of stock. For a very comprehensive overview of how blockchain tokens can function the same way as securities instruments like stock certificates, see Tokenizing Corporate Capital Stock by Gabriel Shapiro.</p><p>From now on, every time you read a statement by the SEC, a judge or someone else saying something along the lines of “tokens are investment contracts” or “tokens are securities,” what you should be hearing is “tokens are transferable securities instruments representing the holder’s rights under an investment contract.” That is quite a mouthful! Hence, I suppose, it is understandable why we all tend to use less precise descriptions most of the time.</p><p>4. When Can a Token-Related Investment Contract Consider to Have Been Fully Performed?</p><p>This is a tricky question.</p><p>When contracts are done the right way — written down in nice clear language and signed by the parties — it is easy to tell what the parties’ respective rights and obligations are. If a party does not perform its obligations, it is easy to tell that the contract has been breached; conversely, when all of the parties’ obligations have been fully performed it is easy to tell that the contract has been fulfilled and expired in accordance with its terms.</p><p>But what about contracts created by law, like investment contracts? What are their terms and conditions? What are each parties’ rights and obligations, and when do they terminate? These questions can be tough to answer because the parties did not observe the typical formalities and spell out all these matters in detail — therefore, it can be hard to determine what the terms and conditions of an investment contract really are.</p><p>Let’s first thing about this in the context of our example — PowerCoin.</p><p>As stipulated in our hypothetical fact set, one of the biggest reasons why people bought PowerCoin is they expected that its value would increase when each step of the whitepaper roadmap was completed — a little bit when privacy features were added to PowerCoin, and then a whole lot more when the new DApp-mining feature was added to PowerChain and its network effects might increase dramatically.</p><p>Therefore, at a minimum, PowerCorp’s obligations under the investment contract certainly include pursuing the completion of that roadmap.</p><p>In addition to completing the technology development roadmap, it might also be inferred that PowerCorp had some obligations to do other things contemplated in the whitepaper, such as promoting and marketing PowerCoin/PowerChain and encouraging decentralization through grant rewards, hack-a-thons, etc., and that it would do these things at least until a kind of critical mass was achieved such that the network is truly open, censorship-resistant and privacy-preserving as contemplated by the network.</p><p>Beyond that, we don’t really know a whole lot about the terms of the investment contract — the law does not imply more terms than it needs to. In particular, we don’t know what level of efforts PowerCorp needs to use to fulfill the roadmap — best efforts? reasonable best efforts? commercially reasonable efforts? The parties have not agreed to a specific dispute resolution mechanism such as going to a Delaware court or seeking binding arbitration. This lack of specificity is suboptimal, but it doesn’t mean there isn’t a contract — it just means there is a very poorly specified contract that is silent on many terms.</p><p>Nevertheless, we do know enough about the investment contract to know that PowerCorp has substantially performed all of its obligations under it. At the network level, PowerChain is thriving and the operation of PowerChain is highly decentralized. At the software development level, everything PowerCorp promised to do has been achieved, and although further improvements could be made, there are independent organizations and individuals that are both incented and empowered to deliver them, either with or without the assistance of PowerCorp.</p><p>To couch this in even more Howey-like terms, the entrepreneurial efforts of PowerCorp are no longer the essential efforts contributing to success of the PowerChain/PowerCoin enterprise, and thus the fourth prong of the Howey test is no longer satisfied. To couch this in the language of tokenomics — further dramatic increases in the value of the tokens as shares of network equity are no longer expected to be driven by PowerCorp or any other particular group of affiliated persons. Both the operation of the network and efforts to increase the value of the network equity have become “sufficiently decentralized”.</p><p>Based on all these facts, it would now be reasonable to conclude that PowerCorp has performed all of its obligations under the investment contract, and that unless PowerCorp starts selling additional PowerCoins with a new roadmap in place that would create new expectations, there is no investment contract and PowerCoins should not be regulated as securities instruments any longer.</p><p>5. “Sufficient Decentralization” is Inherently Necessary to Complete an Open Tokenized Network Roadmap</p><p>It just so happens that tokenized open blockchain networks are the kind of thing that, in order to really work and be valuable, must be decentralized.</p><p>Is it really a coincidence, then, that the point at which the investment contract would be complete (and thus expire) would also be the point at which the network is “sufficiently decentralized”?</p><p>I think not.</p><p>The SEC is correctly perceiving that tokens cease to be securities when the network has become “sufficiently decentralized,” but this in itself does not mean the SEC is enunciating a radical new securities law doctrine. What the SEC is doing — or at least from a doctrinal perspective should be doing — is focusing on whether the investment contract has been fully performed and thus the “efforts of others” are no longer being relied upon sot hat Howey is no longer met. That typically will be the case when the network is “sufficiently decentralized” — or, in any event, it cannot be the case unless the network is sufficiently decentralized. Because the terms of the investment contract require the token seller to try its best create a decentralized network.</p><p>When you think about it, it’s actually quite logical and elegant.</p><p>Test 2 — Sufficient Decentralization Occurs When There is No Longer a Separation Between Ownership and Control of the Network</p><p>We have talked about what “sufficient decentralization” means as a matter of current legal doctrine —i.e., under the Howey test. But what about policy concerns? Normatively, does the mutation process we talked about map onto sound policy goals? Is it consistent with the way we think about securities laws at a deeper level?</p><p>I would argue yes. The easiest way I can explain this is by centering the discussion on one of the deepest and most fundamental principles of corporate and securities laws, which is that such laws exist to help deal with the structural conflicts of interest and other policy concerns arising from the “separation of ownership and control” typical of large-scale modern enterprises.</p><p>What is the separation of ownership and control? Here is a nice concise summary from an article by Stephen G. Marks:</p><blockquote>The separation of ownership and control refers to the phenomenon associated with publicly held business corporations in which the shareholders (the residual claimants) possess little or no direct control over management decisions. This separation is generally attributed to collective action problems associated with dispersed share ownership. The separation of ownership and control permits hierarchical decision making which, for some types of decisions, is superior to the market. The separation of ownership and control creates costs due to adverse selection and moral hazard. These costs are potentially mitigated by a number of mechanisms including business failure, the market for corporate control, the enforcement of fiduciary duties, corporate governance oversight, managerial financial incentives and institutional shareholder activism</blockquote><p>If we go back to our construct that tokens represent shares of network equity, then we can easily see a similar dynamic applying to tokenized open networks. Let’s think about this in the context of our hypothetical PowerChain and PowerCoin.</p><p>Ownership of PowerChain is widely dispersed among many people— likely tens or hundreds of thousands. Thus, PowerChain is very similar to a “publicly held business corporation”. In the early days, though, any dispersal of network ownership is not mirrored by similarly wide dispersal of network control. The network effects are thin and immature, and both ownership of PowerCoins — the network equity — and power over the protocol development process is highly concentrated in PowerCorp. Essentially, PowerCorp is playing a role very similar to the board of directors and executive officers — the management — of a corporation, except it is a network that is being “controlled” rather than a company.</p><p>The separation between ownership control creates many issues, which can necessitate legal or other mechanisms to realign incentives. One does not want the management to entrench itself and extract rent endlessly or unfairly, with no accountability. Of course, in many ways cryptoeconomics exist to replace regulations with technological mechanisms, but, for now, cryptoeconomics apply in-network and are not particularly well suited to govern the relationship between the network and protocol developers, people who hold or trade tokens for profit, etc. Thus, laws and/or contractual mechanisms remain relevant — at least for a time.</p><p>As the network evolved, PowerCorp starts to lose control of PowerChain and PowerCoin. PowerCorp’s ownership of PowerCoin starts out as a majority, and eventually dips below the 10% level. PowerCorp’s control over the software development process for the protocol also diminishes as more independent people and businesses step up to the plate and start contributing.</p><p>Eventually, one reaches the point where PowerCorp is no longer in control, and arguably not even especially influential, over the network — and at that point there is no longer a “separation of ownership and control,” because there is no control, and thus many of the traditional mechanisms like securities regulations, non-waivable fiduciary duties, etc. should be deemed irrelevant or of vastly diminished importance. Essentially, at this point of “sufficient decentralization,” the PowerChain network can be compared to a corporation that is owned by its stockholders and has no management.</p><p>To put it another way: Essentially, the SEC is saying that the same rule applies to sufficiently decentralized open networks as to general partnerships. It is an axiom of securities laws that interests in general partnerships are presumed not to be securities because no one is depending on anyone else, everyone represents himself in the venture, and there are no inherent information or control asymmetries.</p><p>A Possible Safe Harbor for Measuring “Sufficient Decentralization”</p><p>In the realm of securities laws, the SEC has been a driver of “safe harbors” which do not change the law in substance, but provide clarity regarding specific fact patterns that the SEC regards as obviously complying with the law. Regulation D — including the notorious “accredited investor” rule — is actually an example of this and improved upon more general rules like “sales by an issuer not involving any public offering,” which were unclear and subject to frequent litigation.</p><p>This brings us to our next question: Can we propose a “safe harbor” that would provide clarity on when “sufficient decentralization” has been achieved — a hypothetical “Regulation Crypto” or “Reg C”? I believe we can.</p><p>Let’s explore what this might look like:</p><blockquote>(a) Safe Harbor. Any Open Network Token representing an investment contract shall be deemed to no longer represent a security within the meaning of section 2(a)(1) of the Act if it satisfies the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section.</blockquote><blockquote>(b) Conditions to be met.</blockquote><blockquote>(i) less than 10% of the Circulating Token Supply is directly or indirectly owned beneficially by the following persons (individually or collectively): the issuer of such Open Network Token, affiliates of the issuer, persons who are directly or indirectly the beneficial owners of more than 10 percent of any class of any equity security of the issuer or any affiliate of the issuer, and persons who are directors or officers of the issuer or any affiliate of the issuer;</blockquote><blockquote>(ii) prior to commencing sales of the Open Network Token, the issuer filed with the Commission an Open Network Token Offering Statement with respect thereto;</blockquote><blockquote>(iii) the issuer has filed with the Commission a Form C Termination Statement certifying that all of the investment contract performance conditions set forth in the Open Network Token Offering Statement have been satisfied (or, if applicable, waived by action of the holders of the Open Network Token);</blockquote><blockquote>(iv) the Open Network Token does not represent another security within the meaning of Section 2(a)(1) of the Act ; and</blockquote><blockquote>(v) the issuer has not committed any uncured or continuing material violation of securities laws in connection with the Open Network Token</blockquote><p>Keep in mind, this is just a draft. I have tried to dress this up in language that could plausibly be further massaged into an actual SEC rule. In doing so , I have cut some corners, and not defined every relevant term. Believe me, I realize it’s not there yet — it’s meant as a promising starting point.</p><p>For greater clarity and readability, here is a summary of how I see a safe harbor like this working:</p><ul><li>token issuers who wish to take advantage of the safe harbor will have to first file with the SEC an “Open Network Token Offering Statement”</li><li>I envision an Open Network Token Offering Statement would have a level of detail and formality ranging somewhere in between that of a traditional ICO whitepaper and that of a a traditional Private Placement Memorandum</li><li>we could debate whether the Open Network Token Offering Statement should be subject to an SEC qualification requirement (SEC reviews, comments and qualifies the statement) or just a filing requirement (the statement is filed with the SEC, but does not have to be in any way signed off on by the SEC before the token sale commences) — I have deliberately left this point undecided</li><li>the Open Network Token Offering Statement would include a statement of conditions that essentially specifies the roadmap for tech development, marketing, and other relevant factors, and thus determines when the underlying investment contract has been fully performed</li><li>when the investment contract has been fully performed, the issuer must file a termination statement certifying the same</li><li>alternatively, if the issuer originally set up a governance process whereby the token holders could waive any of the performance conditions and this was described in the Open Network Token Offering Statement, then the issuer can also file a termination statement based on such a waiver, or a mix of performances and waivers</li><li>the issuer, its affiliates, and their respective “insiders” (10%+ equity holders or directors and officers) must collectively own less than 10% of the Open Network Token</li></ul><p>This safe harbor achieves three objectives:</p><ul><li>it incents token sellers to set very explicit investment contract terms, rather than having the terms implied by law and leaving them potentially ambiguous and open-ended</li><li>it ensures the Howey test is no longer satisfied by ensuring that the investment contract has been fully performed</li><li>it ensures that many of the policy concerns underlying the securities laws are mitigated because the issuer (and any related group) now hold less than 10% of the ‘network equity’ in the form of tokens</li></ul><p>Conclusion</p><p>We have come a long way. Now is probably a good time recap everything:</p><ul><li>Tokens are primarily shares of network equity; we should expect them to be regulated as representing investment contracts and thus securities, up to a point.</li><li>Tn some cases, such regulation might mean that the issuer has extensive public reporting obligations — however, these may be beneficial, not only from an investment perspective, but also for the development of the open network.</li><li>Over time, the issuer of the token should be able to fulfill the terms of the investment contract represented by the network tokens — when it does, the fourth prong of the Howey test will no longer be met, the tokens will cease being securities and the issuer can terminate its SEC reporting obligations.</li><li>Additionally, the issuer’s stake in the network will decline — when it declines sufficiently, this is independently a good index of when securities laws should cease to apply, since there is no longer an economic “controller” of the network value.</li><li>The SEC should consider enshrining these principles in a formal safe harbor along the lines I have proposed.</li></ul><p>Well, that is it — for now. If you are a lawyer or dev interested in helping advance the ideas set forth in this series of articles — particularly if you can help encourage the SEC to start thinking seriously about a similar safe harbor — you can feel free to contact me on ye olde Twitter, where I am lex_node</p><p>I am also a practicing California attorney who can be hired if you know the right Jawas — bring me your blockchain projects or other corporate / securities law projects, and perhaps we can work together — you don’t know the power of the dark side of the force! *evil laugh*</p>♦♦<p>Size Does Matter — Part 4 was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Bending Bitcoin — The Principle of Hard Money♦<p>Hard money is one of the most well-known monetary terms used in practical discussions. From political discourses on policy decisions to the commentary debates of the financial sector, the term can be heard often enough to make even the ordinary citizens familiar with it. However, and despite its substantial use, while the concept of hard money has a very clear connotation to traditional fiscal responsibility with the monetary system, its exact definition is still quite vague. While for many, it is merely a practical term almost synonymous to a gold-backed system, its conceptual meaning clearly goes beyond that. For theoretical discussions then, it should be evident that, despite gold being for centuries the most accurate practical representation of the concept, it cannot be its very definition. Until today, in spite of the theoretical merits of adequately defining the term, such exact definition seems to have been quite unnecessary. For a long time, it has been established that assuming it as simply meaning a gold system is sufficient for all practical purposes.</p><p>In recent years, however, the term has started being applied to the newly emergent system of cryptocurrencies, and most notably, to Bitcoin. The new employment of the term to describe the new-born monetary system causes an evident confusion as to its exact meaning, and the question of what it is that makes money “hard” has become of practical significance. This current state of affairs has left us with multiple questions. First, what indeed, would be a satisfactory definition for the “hardness” of a monetary system. Then secondly, whether this term could be appropriate to describe Bitcoin. And lastly, if other cryptocurrencies also merit such classification. The rest of this article is thus an attempt to deal with the problems just presented above. As a last note, this article will solely deal with the question of what hard money is. The broader question of whether a hard money system is even desirable in the first place is out of scope for this piece. On that matter, interested readers may find my answer in my previous article.</p>What is hard money?<p>While, as said above, no precise and consistent definition seems to be prevalent in discussions on the subject, we must first provide such a definition if we are to investigate the matter seriously. The definition we shall use from this point forward is as follows:</p><blockquote>The hardness of money is in reverse relation to the monetary inflation, and the consequent dilution of the value of the existing stock, which can economically be inflicted on it.</blockquote><p>Now, there are a few notable points to clarify in order to avoid common misunderstandings regarding the above definition. First and foremost, we shall note that, like many economic terms, the hardness of money is a subjectively perceived factor, subjected to constant changes by various events (such as technological improvement in production, effective counterfeiting, etc.). In this sense, it is similar to discussing the purchasing power of money, which, while can be generally understood, is a rather subjective and ever-changing metric. While this consideration certainly does not invalidate its importance and usefulness, we shall keep in mind these limitations and uncertainties which necessarily accompany its use.</p><p>Swiss based ETP enters the Crypto trading market | Data Driven Investor</p><p>The second point to notice is with regards to what exactly does “can economically be inflicted” mean, and what are the subsequent implications. In simple words, the question is how much of the money can be produced until its value drops (or production costs rise, or both) to such an extent where production is no longer profitable. Here we can notice a sharp distinction between “commodity money”, of which the market determines the supply, and fiat money, of which legislation determines it. As the supply of commodity money is determined by the market demand for it (its price), the costs of its production will always tend to match its market price, as producers will quickly rush to produce more if the margin is larger, and stop production even faster if that becomes unprofitable. On the other hand, the supply of fiat money, such as the government paper we have today, is regulated not by the demand for it, but rather by bureaucratic processes of arbitrary decisions. The main difference concerning us here between the two monetary systems is that, with the former, the risk of dilution of wealth is to be found mostly with technological progress in the production process. While for the latter, there always exists a risk of massive dilution for any arbitrary cause. Thus, while money from the former category is worth the extra effort of looking into its hardness, the latter leaves us no doubt as for its “easiness”. It might be worth mentioning that this monetary easiness is not at all accidental, but rather the intended result of conscious policies aimed mainly at government financing through seigniorage — the monopolistic profits made by the issuer of a currency which is protected by law from market competition. A discussion on the economic and ethical issues of fiat money in general, and seigniorage in particular, is out of the scope of this article. However, interested readers can find such discussions in “The Ethics of Money Production” by Jörg Guido Hülsmann.</p>A (Very) Brief History of Hard Money<p>So far, we provided an exact definition for the concept of hard money and saw why it must be commodity money produced through open competition on the market. Now, we will continue investigating the principles of hard money by looking into some historical monetary systems, and the gradual shift from easier monies to a harder one.</p><p>The history of money, including such notable examples as salt, seashells and glass beads, is full of cases where the advancement of production processes or even the improvement in trade connections for a certain money, along with its inferior monetary properties (durability, divisibility, etc.) compared to another money, caused it to depreciate quickly and eventually to lose its monetary role altogether. Such a process is perhaps best illustrated through the famous case of the Rai stones of Yap island. These stones, ranging in size (and value) from small beads to some massive 3.6 meters tall ones, were for hundreds, if not thousands, of years used by the native population as money. As the methods for producing them did not improve much for the long time of their monetary use, their production remained quite stable for many years, establishing their local status as hard money. However, with the arrival of Europeans around the end of the 19th century, and with the advanced tools and production methods they brought with them, production became increasingly cheaper and the stones started depreciating rapidly until they eventually lost their monetary role to the Western money system. Similar cases were witnessed at many times and places throughout history, such as glass beads and cowry shells in Africa and America, salt in Europe, and so on.</p><p>Since the beginning of their use as money from about 1000 BC, precious metals were probably the most prominent money of all. Used mostly through Europe and Asia as the most common monetary system and later spreading rapidly to all other continents after the discovery of America and under the strong influence of European colonization efforts, the entire world started converging towards a unified monetary system of precious metals, namely copper, silver and gold. The growth in the use of such metallic monetary systems was much due to their relatively excellent physical monetary properties, such as their durability, portability, and divisibility. No less influential, or even more so, was the monetary hardness they demonstrated in comparison to all other monetary goods throughout history. This age-long trend towards the use of metal currency arguably reached its peak around the middle of the nineteenth century. Flourishing as the Gold Standard, which prevailed during La Belle Époque, it has declined since the end of this period around the beginning of WWI. Since then, there has been a strong tendency in the direction of irredeemable fiat money, mainly in the form of paper, “token” coins, and later also its digital representations of today.</p><p>This transition from metallic to a purely fiat standard has its origin with the Chinese invention of banknotes, a paper (or similar material) note which the bearer could redeem for specie, on-demand, from a reserve maintained by the producer of the note. The use of such banknotes as a circulating media of exchange began around the 11th century, with the Jiaozi paper currency, and has continually spread around the world ever since. The peculiarity of the practice was of course not with the new physical form which the instrument of payment has taken, but the fact that, although all notes were redeemable on demand, the reserve maintained only a fraction of the funds needed for the redemption of all notes — what is commonly known today as fractional reserve banking. While these paper forms of money were initially privately issued and used mostly for their easier portability (as carrying metal coins became heavy), they were quickly nationalized and served as a new form of a government financing scheme, namely seigniorage, enabled by their cheap production costs and the use of such fractional reserve techniques. A full examination of the history of banking is out of scope for this article. For our purposes the important thing to note is that while the physical form of money started shifting towards paper long ago, today’s concept of permanently irredeemable paper money constitutes a purely modern “invention”. While it is similar in form and probably owes its existence to such ancient practices as described above, it lacks any historical precedent.</p><p>It is true that the global convergence towards metallic money, and especially the later transition from metallic to a gold standard, owes a significant part of its emergence to the political influence of governments. However, the massive scale of interventionist measures taken to implement this latest transition to a completely irredeemable fiat standard is entirely unprecedented. Arguably starting with WWI, consolidating with the end of WWII, and ripening with Executive Order 11615 of President Nixon in 1971, the transition from a metallic to a pure fiat money has nationalized and politicized the global monetary system in any conceivable aspect. The consequence is a regression in the evolutionary tendencies of money from that of international convergence on the hardest money to a degradation towards the cheapest production methods, which will generate the highest seigniorage profits possible to extract for each national government. Thus, we are not surprised to find out that the last hundred years have experienced over 50 cases of hyperinflationary economic collapses. What used to be an extremely rare event has become an epidemic of modern economies, and is now virtually the only check which deters governments from excessive money production.</p><p>To briefly summarize, the history of money shows us a tendency for international convergence of monetary standards towards the hardest money. This tendency likely reached its peak with the nineteenth-century gold standard, and has been suppressed for the last hundred years by political forces compelling the use of the easiest money — that which can be infinitely created at their whim. While the trend towards hard money seems to have completely reversed, the great economic distress and instability arguably caused by this reverse in trend may indicate its mere temporary nature. Thus, there appears to be a strong reason to believe that these last hundred years will be but a short regression in the long trend towards harder money.</p><p>Nevertheless, this last century left us little hope that such a return to progression could manifest itself as a return to a gold standard. With the transition to global online payments, the need for a centralized trusted reserve for the smooth operation of such a system has grown more evident than ever. Yet this very need for a centralized reserve system is precisely the flaw that allowed the political capture and eventual demise of gold in the first place. Also, taking into account the immense expansion in the power of governments worldwide during the last few decades, the risks inherent in such a centralized reserve system make a return to gold seem like an impractical option, however theoretically desirable it may be. Despite the obstacle posed by the closing of this past option, the advancement of technology has opened up a new alternative in the form of Bitcoin, a digital adaptation of hard money. If it indeed provides a secure alternative, such a system has a true potential for becoming the next evolution in monetary standards, continuing the old trend towards harder forms of money. It is investigating this premise to which we will now turn.</p>Bitcoin as Hard Money<p>In a nutshell, Bitcoin was built to have a final and limited supply, produced by open competition for expending computational power. It is by design limited to a total supply of roughly 21M bitcoins to be produced according to an estimated time schedule. The production of new Bitcoin requires solving a cryptographic puzzle, with each competitor having the probability of solving it in direct relation to its expended computing resources. We see that, by theoretical design, Bitcoin was designed to be hard money, with an eventual hardness allowing for no further production, in a sense, creating absolute scarcity. While we now have the basic understanding needed of the theoretical guarantees of Bitcoin in regards to its monetary hardness, we must proceed to look at how those guarantees are to be secured in practice, and what possible threats may arise for them.</p><p>The monetary hardness of Bitcoin is guaranteed by its consensus rules — the code that either accepts or rejects transaction history (in the form of blocks) according to their validity with this predetermined set of rules. These rules include, among other things, the requirement for a solution to the cryptographic challenge (the proof of work), a verification ensuring no transaction spends more bitcoin than its sender has, and a check that no bitcoins were issues over the supply limit or before the predetermined schedule. Every machine which has verified all the transaction history up to the present, and which maintains as the result of this verification the present UTXO set (the current set of owners of bitcoins), is called a full node. The entire “Bitcoin network” is the sum of all full nodes communicating by the same protocol rules and propagating information about new data (mainly blocks and transactions). By following identical rules of verification, and by passing all data between themselves, all nodes are expected to reach the same view of the current state — a consensus.</p><p>There are two possible ways by which nodes may reach a disagreement over the present state — by having different (or partial) data or by verifying according to different consensus rules. The former case is usually not an issue. It includes mostly nodes in the process of joining the network (in IBD), nodes which have not yet received a new block, and on rare occasions, the case where two conflicting blocks are solved independently of one another and are propagated at the same time. This area of data propagation, while being highly critical, does not concern the monetary hardness of Bitcoin per se, and thus we’ll ignore it for the present discussion. The second possible case — the establishment of different consensus rules — is where the risk of inflation lies and is what we will now examine.</p><p>Strictly speaking, there are no “definitive” rules for Bitcoin. There are, for example, the original rules of the first version of the Bitcoin software, and the rules of the current Bitcoin Core software, but since Bitcoin is an entirely decentralized project, there are no rules one has to follow. This essentially means that (for convenience, taking the most unlikely yet still technically possible case) if all participants in the Bitcoin network were to unanimously modify their rules, for example, as to have permanent inflation, these would become the new rules. There exists no controlling authority which could stop users from running whatever version of the software they desire. This characteristic of Bitcoin, which is inherent in its nature as a man-made digital asset, is probably its most significant difference from the natural commodities, such as gold, and thus requires great attention in assessing the practical hardness of Bitcoin.</p><p>To understand what guarantees the hardness of the monetary policy and other consensus rules of Bitcoin, we should start by analyzing the network, not as a whole, but starting from the very individual nodes comprising it. As far as a full node is concerned, its control over the rules — the “definition” of Bitcoin — is absolute, there is no procedure to compel a node to use a particular set of rules. On the same token, it is also the case that no node can force another to accept its rules. Thus we arrive at a situation where, starting with the initial consensus rules laid out in the first Bitcoin software as base guidance, all nodes in the network must either converge on the same set of rules or lose the ability to transact with the rest of the network. If a node decides, for example, to mint itself new bitcoins “out of thin air”, he may change his own rules as to allow that, but at the cost of losing the ability to transact his “Bitcoin” with the rest of the network. If we assume two people have modified their rules in that way, they give up the ability to transact with all but one another. The same thing happens if we now imagine that 10% of the participants changed their nodes to the new rules, the network can be said to have split into two distinct networks, each defining Bitcoin in a different way.</p><p>While such cases as described above are of little interest, they beget the question of what happens if 50%, or even say 99% modify their rules. In other words, what happens if the majority changes the rules, and what would define a majority in the first place. With Bitcoin, being essentially a communication network, the most appropriate manner to determine a “majority” is to consider the extent to which participants can communicate (transact) with others. Contrary to common fallacies, it does not matter how much hash rate, market cap or total transaction volume a network may have and even less so does it matter how many nodes run its rules (as anyone can deploy as many nodes as he wishes). The only metric which is relevant for the determination of which rules a node joining the network “should” run is to what extent it can transact with others. In simpler terms, how many of those with which he wishes (or expects) to transact with will accept his bitcoins as valid.</p><p>The threat of being unable to transact with others (running incompatible rules) is what deters participants (both other nodes and miners) from arbitrarily modifying the rules. The need for such extensive coordination is what makes changes to Bitcoin, from trivial bug fixes to the most controversial changes, so difficult to implement. Any modification means risking losing the ability to transact with the rest of the network (or part of it). Thus the theoretical ability to exercise such modifications is rarely used. To get back to our subject of monetary hardness, what is most important to understand is that the hardness of Bitcoin for each participant depends on the ability and likelihood of a sufficiently large portion of the network to coordinate and successfully perform a consensus rule change which will inflate the supply of Bitcoin. It is important to emphasize that “sufficiently large” means such a large portion with which losing the ability to transact would render Bitcoin useless. This measure, like the rules of Bitcoin themselves, is by necessity subjective, but it should not be hard to have a rough agreement on what such a case would look like.</p>Bitcoin’s Soft Spot<p>As we have seen by now, since each user of Bitcoin can run his own node, the power of a participant in the influence over the enforcement of the consensus rules is solely with regard to the transactions he is personally involved in. A node must verify all transactions not for the sake of enforcing the rules for others on the network, but for being able to determine whether a payment he receives himself is valid or not — this is the economic activity of a participant, and it is the only manner by which he may influence the decision of others to use certain rules. Whenever one accepts payment in Bitcoin, it’s akin to asserting what the definition of Bitcoin is by enforcing the consensus rules under which the payment is accepted.</p><p>However, while in our analysis until now we have (intentionally and implicitly) assumed that every participant is actively setting his own rules by running certain code with his full node, and using it to verify the validity of incoming payments, this is not necessarily (and indeed is often not) the case. It is completely possible for anyone to delegate the responsibility of this active rule setting by passively trusting another entity with validating transactions for him. By doing so, the receiver of payment in a sense delegates his economic activity on the network, thus the influence over the consensus rules, to another which in turn may use it with whatever rules he likes. For example, assuming I am using an online Block Explorer to verify that I have received a transaction, whenever I accept a transaction in such a manner, I delegate the influence my economic activity may have over the rules to the operator of that service. If, for example, the operator would decide to use rules allowing larger blocks, new signature schemes or (more worrisome) changing the rate of inflation, I am not only susceptible to passively accept these changes against my consent, I am in fact actively endorsing them by signaling my willingness to accept transactions using these specific rules.</p><p>In the previous section, we have concluded that in order to impair the monetary hardness of Bitcoin, it is necessary to coordinate (convince others to perform) a consensus rules modification causing such a change with a sufficiently substantial portion of the active economic participants of the network, a task we can consider quite impractical in light of both theoretical considerations and practical (although short and insufficient) experience. This difficulty in coordination is not merely due to the decentralized structure of the Bitcoin network, but specifically due to the decentralized, or more correctly self-sovereign, enforcement of rules over individual economic activity. When each participant is actively validating his transaction, it is necessary to convince a very considerable part (if not almost all) of them to accept the new set of rules modifying the hardness of Bitcoin. However, the fewer participants actively validating their transactions, the more centralized does the verification of economic activity becomes, and thus the easier it is to carry out such a change.</p><p>Although, in theory, nothing prevents the use of a full node by each participant, there are various practical obstacles for running and using a full node. Probably the most significant of these obstacles is the technical complexity of operating such a node, which for many is still a very non-trivial task. Moreover, there are the issues posed by the size of the transaction history data, which when increased affects both the initial time needed to join the network, while also raising the hardware requirements needed for an active node, making it increasingly more expensive to maintain. These issues (and potentially various others), while probably manageable, can, if left unhandled, lead to such dangerously large centralization of payment verification which could potentially nullify the monetary hardness guaranteed by the theoretical design of Bitcoin.</p><p>The greatest risk to the hardness of Bitcoin lies therefore in the centralization of payment verification. We see that in theory, if a sufficiently large part of the network is using just a few service providers for validating their transactions, there is a chance that these service providers will coordinate a change to the supply of Bitcoin while having the unaware but nonetheless economically active support of everyone using them to accept Bitcoin payments. It is true that as long as you run your own full node you are able to stick to the present “hard money rules”, but if such a large part of the network has moved (aware of the change or not) to an inflationary set of rules, you will lose the ability to transact with them and thus the utility of using Bitcoin. Before reaching our conclusions on the hardness of Bitcoin, we should address the question of whether other cryptocurrencies may be termed hard money, and what differentiates Bitcoin from all of them.</p>What about “Shitcoins”?<p>Contrary to constant claims from almost any “blockchain-based” shitcoin, none of them can be considered as hard money. While there are many different implementations for how a decentralized blockchain may work (PoW/ PoS, etc.), they must all rely on the same client-side payment verification model discussed above. However, unlike Bitcoin, they all either merely pay lip service or even disregard completely the importance of self-sovereignty in determining the consensus rules. That is, they all tend towards centralizing the formation and enforcement of the consensus rules. Some projects have some sort of central authority, to which, with little exception, most decisions on the rules are delegated (whatever explicitly or implicitly). Others disregard the necessity of keeping the ability to run a full node as accessible as possible and thus lead to centralization in payment verification. And yet others which try to set up a “governance” process — making arbitrary changes to the consensus a matter of formality.</p><p>I should emphasize that I’m not speaking of all “blockchain projects” or projects with decentralized governance. What I’m speaking against is the often-heard claim of various tokens that they should be considered as hard money, while in practice, their supply can and regularly is arbitrarily altered. As defined above, the hardness of money is in reverse relation to the monetary inflation which can economically be inflicted on its holders. With such digital assets that either rely on a centralized (or semi-centralized) payment verification or have some clear and simple process for modifying the consensus rules, there cannot be even the pretense of being hard money. The potential inflation which could be inflicted upon them is infinite — once you can modify the “monetary policy” of a digital asset, there is virtually no limit to how much you can create from it, and it cannot be considered a harder money any more than any of the fiat monetary systems.</p><p>There is no claim here that the current state of Bitcoin is perfect, or anywhere near that. There is of course much undesirable centralization of verification in the space of Bitcoin as well, and even more concerningly, there is a great sentiment of ignorance of the importance of such self-sovereign verification. However, the main difference is the insistence of Bitcoin “activists” on promoting the use of full nodes, such examples being the Core developers’ efforts on keeping nodes usable on even such weak and affordable machines as a Raspberry Pi, and the many projects which provide various options for running a full node, from a plug and play machines to a completely DIY solutions. The ecosystem dedicated to promoting and simplifying the use of Bitcoin full nodes is both very significant and rapidly growing, and the community’s emphasis on this subject is unmatched by any other project.</p><p>Furthermore, and no less important, is the fact that, being the “first of its kind”, Bitcoin serves as the base consensus rules not only of a single asset but of general digital value transmission. As Bitcoin is in principle a protocol, or even (in its most basic sense) an idea, for “A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”, and since its rules are, as we have seen, determined individually and independently by its users, it means that in some sense, all other implementations of such a system could be seen as versions of Bitcoin, but with a completely modified set of rules. With that taken into account, the mere fact that these other “Bitcoins” have such a different set of rules and a substantially different monetary policy, signals the relative malleability of their rules — which have disconverged from the original base rules in a very incompatible manner and for no real (monetary) reason (such as an emergency change due to a bug). We may say that these other coins, being a mere replication of Bitcoin’s model, at least in the monetary field, have already proven their lack of hardness by their mere creation as an arbitrary divergent from the main Bitcoin protocol. All those coins might very well have significant differences from Bitcoin and various other “use-cases”, but with regards to being a hard money system, they have all started at a loss against “The Bitcoin Standard”.</p>On Bugs<p>Before concluding our discussion, there are few remarks which still need to be made. First, while until now we have discussed the hardness of Bitcoin as derived from enforcing its coded rules, we must note another caveat. Bitcoin is a software, and like any software, it can and did (and possibly still does) have bugs. While it’s true that such bugs could cause unexpected inflation, they are unlikely to have any serious impact on the hardness of Bitcoin.</p><p>To understand why, we may divide the possible inflationary bugs into minor (1, 10 or even 100,000 bitcoin — like could happen with CVE-2018–17144) and major ones (like a 184 billion coins inflation). Minor bugs may indeed introduce some inflation, which technically would undermine the core tenet of limited supply, but since they can be quickly fixed, their effect on the total supply will be effectively inconsequential in the long run. In more popular terms, they may increase the stock of Bitcoin to a small extent, but they do not undermine its guarantees as for the upcoming expected flow of new coins.</p><p>As for major bugs, while potentially undermining the interim confidence in the success of Bitcoin, the retroactive countermeasures which could be implemented to nullify the effects of such a clear violation of the constitutional precedent of limited supply would be successful in preserving Bitcoin’s creed. Such measures would be absolutely necessary to preserve the value of the coin-holders and the utility of the network itself. In fact, this is precisely the course of events that transpired in the wake of such a catastrophic bug in 2010. As we have concluded previously, the lack of malleability of the rules of the network contributes to its hardness as a monetary medium. However, here, it is apparent that the literal opposite is true as well; it is the ability of the network to evolve to protect users by way of them each acting individually in their own self-interest that defends the 21 million hard cap.</p>Conclusions<p>Throughout the article, we have discussed the basic principle of hard money and how it relates to Bitcoin. We saw that from the theoretical aspect, the usual description of Bitcoin as “the hardest money ever” is well deserved, but from the practical perspective, the soundness of this statement is to a large extent dependent on the exercise of their self-sovereignty by its users — the use of full nodes for validating and accepting transactions.</p>Run a Full Node!<p>For the hardness of Bitcoin, it is necessary that as many economic participants as possible use their own full node. However, far more important than this “collective” necessity of self-sovereignty, there are the “individual” reasons to run a full node.</p><p>As said above, when you don’t verify your own transactions but trust another party to do so, you blindly accept whatever definition that party may use for what Bitcoin is. It may very well be that they verify transactions by rules incompatible with most other network participants. Furthermore, they might not be truly verifying anything at all, and just arbitrarily present to you fake data. It is of course very unlikely, at least at this stage of Bitcoin, for established service providers to risk losing their customers by providing them with incorrect or misleading data (although we have already seen such cases, mostly with the Bitcoin Cash and Segwit2X cases). It may very well be fine to occasionally use the assistance of such services, especially for small payments.</p><p>The main thing to remember is that by delegating verification of payments, you open yourself to significant risks, while also potentially weakening the hardness of the rules of Bitcoin. I would not discourage the use of such services altogether, but for those using Bitcoin either frequently or with large amounts, as well as for anyone who cares about their privacy and wants strong security, I would highly recommend to make this effort and find a self-sovereign full node solution which suits their needs. (See below for guidance for that).</p><p>Although commonly heard, the advice to use a full node cannot be stressed strongly enough, it is a crucial part of using Bitcoin — as without using a full node, you cannot even know if you’re really using Bitcoin.</p>How to Run a Bitcoin Full Node<p>Up to this point, we dealt with the fundamental question of why run a full node. Now, it is time for us to move to the no less important question of how to run a full node. But first, let’s start by clearing a few popular misconceptions as to the requirements needed for running a full node. As for today, the minimum disk space required to operate a Bitcoin full node is no more than 10GB. For an illustration of how small that is, you can find a 16GB SD card for less than 4$. Most smartphones today already come with at least 32GB, and for many, it is possible to add more with such SD cards. It is true that storing the entire history (~300GB as for today) is much preferable, but this is not necessary for running a secure and fully verifying full node, and should not be an excuse not to use one.</p><p>Another important misconception is an alleged need for strong computing power, this misunderstanding usually comes from the confusion between a Bitcoin miner and a full node. It is true that in order to run a (profitable) Bitcoin mining operation, it is necessary to have some expensive specialized hardware, but this is not necessary at all for running a full node. To run a full node you can use as little as a mere Raspberry Pi, or simply your personal computer or smartphone.</p><p>The last thing to note here is the alleged complexity of running a full node. It must be admitted that for now, running a full node is probably not something your grandma will be able to do, but so wasn’t, and still isn’t for many, using a smartphone or a web browser. While in the present time it is certainly easier to use a web browser than running a full node, we should remember that for now Bitcoin is a not only new, but brings a completely new paradigm for using money. The invention of implementing Bitcoin itself was for decades considered an impractical challenge. Compared to that, the challenge of building an ecosystem of user friendly full node solutions is exceedingly minor. The fact that we’ve gotten so far makes me quite confident that the challenge of creating a user-friendly full node will not be a true obstacle. It is also conducive to look at how greatly the simplicity of using a full node has already improved during these last 10 years. Without having any budget whatsoever, depending on the voluntary contributions of people alone, dozens of solutions have already been created for various different audiences.</p><p>Here, I will list a few of the present options. As I cannot guarantee otherwise, I must note that this list might contain imperfect options, and does not substitute for doing your own research in regards to the quality and integrity of the services.</p><p>Probably the simplest solution for anyone familiar with the basic use of a computer is to use the Bitcoin Core software.

This is considered a relatively insecure practice. Many users therefore opt to use hardware wallets (such as Trezor, Ledger, and ColdCard). Though (at least considered) much more secure for key management, the benefit derived from using such hardware wallets is significantly impaired if they are not used along with a full node. While most hardware wallets don’t provide a (simple) integration with a user’s full node, there are complementary solutions developed to provide such support.</p><ul><li>Bitcoin-Core HWI — A UI for interacting with many types of hardware wallets while connecting them to Bitcoin Core for verification.</li><li>Electrum Personal Server — Allows the integration of Electrum wallet with a Bitcoin full node.

  Bitcoin is everyone’s problem now<blockquote>Evey: Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot… But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail.</blockquote><blockquote>He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I’ve witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I’ve seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them… but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it. Ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love…</blockquote><p>– Evey Hammond, V for Vendetta</p>♦An exorbitant privilege<p>Bitcoin is first and foremost a monetary phenomenon. The social climbers and false prophets who proclaimed it is a payments revolution have either come around or been repudiated by the market and washed out, embittered. Most who understood it that way are now moving on to new things. The world did not need another Paypal. The world needed a new monetary institution.</p><p>As Bitcoin went from a proof of concept, to a toy, to a joke, to a collectible, and then to a movement, a few policymakers came to realize that it posed a threat to the established system. Not because of its present form, but because what it represented: a profane insult to the carefully calibrated monetary system. All done in a mocking, insouciant fashion — a band of nerds and ne’er-do-wells insolently challenging the state’s monopoly on seigniorage. Satire is what despots fear most, and the rise of Bitcoin made our present monetary system look patently absurd.</p><blockquote>Critic: Nothing backs Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoiner: What backs the dollar?</blockquote><blockquote>Critic: Nothing intrinsically — our ability to compel foreign nations to accept our currency as the numeraire of international trade, our ability to force citizens to pay taxes in dollars, and our military assets required to enforce both conditions.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoiner: How persuasive!</blockquote><p>The visceral hatred elites feel about Bitcoin? Perfectly justified. How else would you react to a upstart aimed at usurping your sacred monetary privilege?</p><p>Such is the potency of Bitcoin that it compels the high priests of U.S. imperialism to reveal the unwritten rules about the role the dollar plays in power projection abroad. In May of this year, U.S. Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) spoke out against cryptocurrency on the floor of the house. His statement laid bare the normally veiled post-Bretton Woods doctrine in which the dollar is employed not only a monetary tool but a strategic one, too.</p><blockquote>An awful lot of our international power comes from the fact that the dollar is the standard unit of international finance […] and it is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrency to take that power away from us […]. Whether it is to disempower our foreign policy, our tax collection, or our traditional law enforcement […]. the purpose of cryptocurrency […] is solely to aid in the disempowerment of the United States and the rule of law.</blockquote><p>Representative Sherman is practically a soothsayer. He understands precisely where the world is going.</p><p>His mistake is not in the diagnosis, but in the cure. He mistakenly believes that Bitcoin can be reckoned with. But Bitcoin is an idea, not a product. The notion of a weightless, virtual commodity was productized for good in 2009 (although the idea long predated Bitcoin), and it has been eroding the state’s monetary monopoly ever since.</p><p>It could not have been created at a better time; one wonders how Bitcoin would have fared if it had been created in the 1980s or 90s when the US economy was fairer, the monetary system was totally unquestioned, and the US was the sole dominant global superpower. Against today’s backdrop, Bitcoin insists on itself. It has urgency. In the halcyon days of Pax Americana, Bitcoin would have mattered much less. In the twilight of the American empire, however, it is more relevant than ever.</p>Our monetary system is disastrously redistributive<p>The wealth of political elites derives primarily from privileged access to the monetary spigot. This is no longer a secret. The heavenly mana of seigniorage has opened, first a trickle and now a flood. The world is grappling with inequality, and the dozens of populist revolts active in the world today are patent evidence of this. Yet the resurgent socialist parties misdiagnose the situation. The enemy is not a nebulous form of capitalism, but rather a form of socialism itself — a low-rates fueled perma-bailout to the owners of financial assets. It’s no coincidence that asset prices have steadfastly risen in the last decade, as the Fed has embarked on a ludicrously unshackled period of money creation.</p><p>Many ask: against the backdrop of monetary issuance, where did the inflation go? It went of course into financial assets. But this benefits the paltry few. Did you know that the decade-long rally in the S&amp;P500 has been characterized by historically low participation from retail investors? The riotous gains in asset prices have sidelined mom and pop. They accrue instead to institutional investors and corporate insiders who returned capital to themselves through buybacks. In the 90s, Wharton MBAs convinced investors that the ideal mode of corporate governance was making large equity and options grants to corporate directors to create incentive alignment. Well, the grants were made, and the directors rewarded the shareholders by spending corporate earnings on buying back the stock, thus juicing earnings per share and triggering options payouts for directors. They just so happened to forgot to generate corporate value along the way. That pesky real economy… that was secondary.</p><p>Why are politicians so rich? Why do they become rich after leaving office? Why do regulators go work in industry? Why is the Secretary of the Treasury a former Goldman banker and hedge fund manager?</p>♦The Cantillon effect pictured<p>Why are renters historically disempowered, whereas landowners are historically privileged? Why has the cost of higher education and healthcare outpaced inflation by orders of magnitude? Why is the CPI a sad, pathetic joke? Do consumer goods account for most of your expenditures, or does rent, healthcare, and education?</p><p>What are you more exposed to? The cost of a TV, or property values?</p><p>Even if you didn’t know what the Cantillon effect was, you felt it vividly in the last decade. The hopelessness felt by many in today’s society is the consequence of this monetary misalignment; the introduction of eye-watering money into the economy, but an uneven distribution. Who benefited from historically low rates? Normal folks dealing with predatory credit card loans, or owners of financial assets who were able to put historically cheap capital to work? And no, cheap financing didn’t help the middle and lower class get a foothold in property… because property values were horrendously inflated in the first place! Property, treated as a store of value for the rich, is precisely where so many of the Fed’s newly-minted dollars settled. Reflect on those hollowed-out city centers in Vancouver, New York, and London — full of empty homes used as capital warehouses for absentee millionaires.</p><p>If there’s a single graph that evidences the impact of a decade of freewheeling monetary stimulus on the economy, it is the following:</p>♦<p>Monetary velocity in the U.S. is at its lowest since modern records began. If you think about the equation of exchange (MV = PQ), a decline in V is sufficient to offset an increasing money supply (M) to keep prices (P) stable. And that’s just about what happened: the purchasing power of the dollar has remained relatively stable even as supply has expanded dramatically. “Where is the inflation?” is the common refrain, but the question should instead be “where has the new money supply gone?” It is clear that it has settled, inert and unproductive, in financial assets mostly owned by the ultra-rich, bidding them up to century highs in relative valuation terms.</p><p>This is why our perverse form of zombie capitalism is often referred to as socialism for the rich. If you can position yourself close enough to the money spigot and arrange to share in the spoils of the monetary redistribution, you can profit handsomely. If you have access to financial assets and can benefit from a low cost of capital (whether you are an investor or a corporate director with discretion over buybacks), you can make low rates and quantitative easing work for you. If you cannot, you are utterly frozen out of the system, and indeed disadvantaged, as pricier capital assets immiserate the non rentier class.</p>Bitcoin is a system that explicitly rejects identity<p>Critics often ask who, exactly, Bitcoin is for. This perhaps a misspecified question. Bitcoin does not serve a “who,” or a subset of whos. It just serves, indifferent its end users. Bitcoin, by design, does not require identity data to work. Your counterparty could be on the OFAC sanctions list, they could be a sentient toad, or a few lines of code. Bitcoin has no way of knowing, nor does it care. The only requirement to send a payment is to provide a valid signature which meets the criteria sufficient to unencumber a UTXO.</p><p>Traditional payment and credit relationships, on the other hand, enshrine identity. My credit card company is very interested in knowing that it is me who is using the card. If I inform them that a stranger has absconded with my card, they consider all the spends post-theft totally invalid. The call with the fraud department goes like this:</p><ul><li>‘Can you vouch for the $10.51 purchase on 2/24 at Chipotle?’ Yes, that was me. Extra guac.</li><li>‘Can you vouch for the $463.39 purchase on 2/29 at Lululemon?’ No, I don’t habitually buy athleisure gear.</li></ul><p>Identity data is inextricable from traditional payment networks. This is because they are many layers between payments and final settlement. An incredibly large and profitable business exists to assess the credibility of transactors and facilitate deferred-settlement transactions between them. This is because credibility and mutual trust enables massive efficiencies. You can lend your neighbor a lawnmower without demanding he provide a bond to cover its value because you trust him. Credit card networks just scale this up: they are trust underwriters, determining quantitatively how trustworthy I am, and passing along those assurances to merchants with whom I transact.</p><p>If they get it wrong, and it turns out I’m the kind of person who racks up a $10,000 credit card bill with no intention of ever paying, they swallow the cost! It was their bad. They should have done a better job assessing my trustworthiness.</p><p>The compact you implicitly agree to when you use Bitcoin is between you and the protocol, not between you and all the other users of Bitcoin. The only trust required is users trusting that the cryptographic and economic assumptions hold. So far, they have.</p><p>It has become trendy to denounce popular Bitcoiners as uncompromising, unreasonable assholes, and imply that there is something wrong with Bitcoin as a consequence, too. But Bitcoin is indifferent to this. It is a protocol for encoding and conveying value through a communications medium. Bitcoin isn’t even aware of what the price of Bitcoin is, let alone the political trends of the day. It knows very, very little about itself.</p><p>As stated above, Bitcoin is attractive and useful precisely because it rejects any identity data from the conditions required for a spend. The only thing that has to be furnished is knowledge of a private key corresponding to a public key. When you receive Bitcoin, you do not need to be aware of the identity of the sender, because Bitcoin settles probabilistically. You can simply define your own threshold for finality — say, requiring $500,000 of work to be done before you consider a transaction final. That would correspond to waiting, at current rates, for 4–5 blocks under which your transaction should be buried.</p><p>This is what allows me to accept funds from people that I mistrust, and why Bitcoin is carving out a niche in these frontier transactions. Think of a ransomware hacker and his victim. These people mutually mistrust each other. They victim has been wounded and attacked. But the hacker still trusts that the $500 sent to them for the ransom in the form of BTC is a valid, unlikely-to-be-reversed payment. You may not like this. But Bitcoin flourishes on the margins of society. These are increasingly widening, as banking becomes politicized and used as a political tool, as the U.S.-driven settlement system is coopted for strategic objectives, and as identity requirements for payments networks become ever more rapacious.</p><p>Transacting with people you have no reason to trust is precisely why Bitcoin exists. The internet allowed us to transact with people on the other side of the globe, but internet commerce is beset by fraud. The reason credit cards are expensive is because the costs of remediating fraud and chargebacks are socialized.</p>If you aren’t comfortable with evil people using Bitcoin, you should abandon it now<p>Of course, the jettisoning of counterparty trust (and risk) comes with some perceived drawbacks. Principal among them, you cannot evict someone from your network. This is very uncomfortable to people who believe that money ought to be a political tool, to be exploited to disempower political foes of the day.</p>♦<p>There is a particular paradox in demanding that the members of a network you have inserted yourself into adhere to a certain moral code of conduct. As stated above, Bitcoin, and fast-settling hard money more generally, exists to facilitate commerce between individuals that do not have a pre-existing bond of trust. What did inter-continental traders use to transact in the 17th century? They certainly didn’t use IOUs, wampum, collectibles, or credit relationships. They knew that they might never see each other again, so they used the hardest money they had available — gold and silver. Monetary metals speak for themselves; they are no one’s liability.</p><p>In this same way, Bitcoin is a means to transfer wealth between individuals who both have an interest in final settlement. It is not a means to establish a credit relationship (although Lightning is an early move in this direction). Bitcoin is deliberately amoral, it has no requirements to entry and asks nothing of the user aside from a valid signature. It facilitates commerce between people who explicitly disagree with each other. Thus trying to impose a moral code on Bitcoin is contrary to its very nature. If everyone who used Bitcoin agreed with each other, then no one would need Bitcoin — they could all exchange IOUs backed by their mutual trust in each other. But because the world is messy, and people disagree with each other, hard money is warranted. Our chaotic world practically demands it.</p><p>So if you are the kind of person that rejects a useful transactional medium because someone you dislike is using it as well, it wasn’t suited for you in the first place. Bitcoin is edgy precisely because the world needs a payment and savings system which cannot be interfered with on moral or political grounds. To repudiate these transactional constraints is to violate the carefully poised moral setting that has seized the West. If stepping out of line isn’t for you, stick to Paypal instead.</p>Bitcoin is an apocalyptic death cult…<p>As Bitcoin hater-in-chief David Gerard so elegantly puts it, Bitcoin is in fact an apocalyptic death cult. Apocalyptic, because Bitcoiners recognize the futility of the current monetary system, and appreciate that it is likely to end in tears. Death, because States won’t give up their monetary privilege easily. Bitcoin is veiled in eschatological overtones. Cult, because you have to be somewhat deranged to take a pill this black.</p>♦Freedom is not “Free”.<p>So spare a thought for the Bitcoiners. They are fully awakened to the pending grief and strife that await us, Cassandras warning governments and citizens alike to the disruptive effects of truly sovereign currency (sovereign, as in free, not as in State-owned). But unable, most of the time, to convince their fellow man that the State’s monetary machinations may not be sound. Most people are content to surrender all freedom and autonomy to the Leviathan, as long as the pot they are in boils slowly.</p>… but it’s open to all<p>The exact reason that Bitcoin is despised by so many— identity, creditworthiness, and trust are irrelevant in this system, making it a fertile ground for criminals — is the exact reason why it’s so inclusive. Unlike Paypal, Venmo, or traditional payment processors, it cannot deplatform you for wrongthink, holding subversive political views, being a sex worker, or legally selling cannabis. Ours is the biggest possible tent. Don’t be distracted by the online discourse. Bitcoin is utterly indifferent to the political views of its users. Its core developers, the high priests of the protocol, can barely change it: (implementing a fairly routine upgrade, SegWit, took them years of cajoling and pleading). Getting it to do anything other than produce blocks, accept valid spends, resolve forks, and relentlessly march onward is virtually impossible.</p><p>Whether Bitcoin will challenge the State, or whether that task will be left up to a successor, is yet to be determined. That the State’s monetary privilege has been permanently eroded is evident though.</p><p>It died a little that day in January 2009 when the Chancellor [was] On the Brink, and it has been shrinking ever since.</p><p>By Nic Carter,<br>Oct, 2019</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below.

  medium.com/media/59cda701c33c68cabe2dc0848d2ffaec/href<p>People hate Bitcoin analogies. But Bitcoin is so hard to understand for so many, concessions need to be made.</p><p>VCs are a group of people demonized in the Bitcoin industry for not understanding Bitcoin’s value proposition. Well, how do you expect a VC to value Bitcoin if they’re only used to valuing startups?</p><p>Here is a framework that will hopefully help. It tracks the development and evolution of the Bitcoin ecosystem in discreet “fundraising rounds”, which coincide with Bitcoin’s Reward Eras. An organization is defined as “an organized group of people with a particular purpose”. If that’s the case, then Bitcoin is a well-oiled “un-organisation” with founders but no CEOs, many volunteers but no employees, and provably non-diluting equity, available to anyone who is willing to trade their energy for it.</p>♦Bitcoin As A Startup<p>I will be borrowing heavily from Nathan Reiff’s piece “Series A, B, C Funding: How It Works”</p>Pre-seed Round (1st Reward Era, 3/1/2009–28/11/2012)<blockquote>The earliest stage of funding a new company comes so early in the process that it is not generally included among rounds of funding at all. Known as “pre-seed” funding, this stage typically refers to the period in which a company’s founders are first getting their operations off the ground. The most common “pre-seed” funders are the founders themselves, as well as close friends, supporters, and family (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>The “Bitcoin Company” was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto, with its single product offering being an open-source monetary system project, known as Bitcoin. 2,100,000,000,000,000 shares were to be issued on a predetermined schedule, and anyone was free to buy or sell these shares. The founders initially held no initial equity, but equity was easy to build in those days, and rightly so. Just like any startup, it is the founding team and initial bootstrappers who should get the biggest rewards down the line for putting the most skin in the game.</p><p>Due to the nature of Bitcoin’s incentive mechanisms, many early “equity holders” were encouraged to use their time, skills and money to evangelise or develop the product, and hence increase the value of their equity. The company manages itself, in a zero-overhead environment.</p><p>During the first stage of “the company’s” life, traditionally the “the first bugs appeared and were ironed out, and this was an iterative process for many months. After proving to be robust and reliable, a market developed, and the first exchanges started to emerge. User experience, both from a software point of view, and a financial point of view, were a disaster. Bitcoin was virtually unusable without a PhD in Computer Science, and when you could use it, you’d be robbed by an exchange that had been “hacked”. Volatility was extreme, and the risk was unpalatable for the majority of onlookers. Whether or not “The Bitcoin Company” would remain “in business” was still a very dubious proposition.</p><p>This Era, the early equity holders were blessed with a parabolic bubble, and many divested some equity to give themselves runway to work on Bitcoin full time. It’s just like a fund-raise: get a big cash injection, and then burn it relentlessly until the next funding round. Coincidently, each round has exhibited at least one of these massive injections and equally massive drawn-out draw-downs.</p><p>During this Era, miners were rewarded with USD$13.5m in total block rewards and transaction fees. Assuming that, on average, cost to mine a bitcoin is equal to the market price, we can consider the mining reward to be miners buying bitcoin at-spot. Therefore, we can take the “money-in” for the round to be the cumulative miner’s revenue. Money-in is never consistent, and even a small injection is enough to make the price fly and form a bubble.</p><p>With all the above said, fortune favours the bold, and Bitcoin entered its seed round at a $1bn pre-money valuation (i.e. Bitcoin’s Market Cap was $1bn at the end of the first reward era).</p>Seed Round (2nd Reward Era, 28/11/2012–9/7/2016)<blockquote>You can think of the “seed” funding as part of an analogy for planting a tree. This early financial support is ideally the “seed” which will help to grow the business. Given enough revenue and a successful business strategy, as well as the perseverance and dedication of investors, the company will hopefully eventually grow into a “tree.” (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>Risk of short-term ecosystem death did not substantially decrease until the end of the Secord Reward Era. You could say that the risk profile dropped from “Extreme” to “Very High”. In terms of PR/Optics, this was arguably the worst and most dubious “round” of Bitcoin’s existence. In the face of these FUD-inspiring superficial problems, Bitcoin did what it does best — got on with it.</p><p>This era saw the first Bitcoin bubble to be featured in Mainstream Media in some way shape or form. Going from catastrophe to catastrophe; from the numerous exchange hacks, scams, asset seizures, 51% attacks (GHash.io) and China bans, those who invested in the mania of 2013 would not break even until the Third Reward Era. Inflation made things worse, with the market having to absorb the 5.25 million Bitcoin producing during the Era. However, those who divested during the mania provided themselves with many years of runway to give back to Bitcoin and make their equity more valuable.</p><p>In this Era, we started to see the emergence of user-friendly plug-and-play hardware wallets; the age of ASIC mining was in full swing, with miner fabrication done at a huge scale. The gamblers had a field day — with the majority of “fiat-onramps” providing toys for the traders, but not for the savers. For better or worse though, this added much needed liquidity and means for price-discovery. That said, liquidity was quite low, and for the first half of the era when the exchanges were just so sketchy, you couldn’t even really trust what the advertised market price was.</p><p>The first VCs entered the game; some investing in Bitcoin companies, and others, like Tim Draper, investing directly in the underlying.</p><p>Miners were not put off by the prolonged bear market, with the network hashrate growing by orders of magnitude mostly due to competition-driven innovation among ASIC fabricators. In the Second Reward Era, miners earned a total of USD$600m for their efforts. This USD$600m “investment” resulted in an $11bn post-money valuation at the end of the Round.</p><p>Despite failing to reclaim the heights of 2013, Bitcoin closed this round on the upswing — one that wouldn’t end for another year and a half.</p>Series A — Optimise (3rd (and Current) Reward Era, 9/7/2016 — May 2020)<blockquote>Once a business has developed a track record (an established user base, consistent revenue figures, or some other key performance indicator), that company may opt for Series A funding in order to further optimize its user base and product offerings. (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>With “traditional” startups, their Series A round is used to fund the optimization of the offering, and to lay a solid platform to build further during the next round. Several experts and industry stakeholders were split on how to best optimize Bitcoin to increase transaction throughput. The Establishment took the view that achieving this through an increase in block size was the answer, The People took the view that this was a slippery slope, and that scaling be achieved with protocol optimisations, i.e., Segregated Witness (SegWit). The People were victorious, which was a huge positive indicator that centralizing Bitcoin would be a Sisyphean task. As a result, and in combination with a supply halving, the money flowed in, and Bitcoin achieved a valuation in the hundreds of billions at its all-time-high.</p><p>The Third Era also featured “The Scambrian Explosion”, with thousands of cryptocurrencies being spawned, sending Bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency to a paltry 35% at one point in time. While most of these altcoins now having lost over 95% of their value (hundreds have lost &gt;99% of their value), the only result was the wasting of hundreds of thousands of hours of development time and hundreds of millions of dollars which should have been directed at Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin now accounts for 75% of the cryptocurrency market (and rising) is a testament to why people should have just stuck to Bitcoin.</p><p>The huge influx of money in this Era allowed early equity holders to further divest to focus on development — and my oh my, was there a lot of development. In terms of scalability, The Lightning Network successfully came out of beta and is being extensively used. Privacy and coin-joining solutions emerged and became easier to use. There are literal satellites in space broadcasting the network. The rise of the “run your own node” movement gathered serious momentum and was bolstered by a host of companies offering “plug-and-play” nodes. With your own node, you can also be your own payments provider through BTCPayServer. Multi-signature security has never been easier. This paragraph could go on for pages — so if you want a full technical recap of just 2019, the Bitcoin Optech Newsletter will give you everything you need to know.</p><p>At time of writing, Era miner revenue is USD$4.6bn, and the valuation has risen from $11bn to over $125bn.</p><p>Despite all the progress made, Bitcoin is still a high-to-very-high risk investment at this stage, as the market price can still move in excess of 30%, in either direction, in one week, regularly. This will ultimately remain the case until both the liquidity pool grows, and the mining reward (inflation) shrinks.</p>Series B — Build (4th Reward Era, May 2020 — Apr 2024)<blockquote>Series B rounds are all about taking businesses to the next level, past the development stage. Investors help startups get there by expanding market reach. Companies that have gone through seed and Series A funding rounds have already developed substantial user bases and have proven to investors that they are prepared for success on a larger scale. Series B funding is used to grow the company so that it can meet these levels of demand</blockquote><p>With the necessary protocol upgrades happening during Series A and early in Series B, the focus will shift to the building of products and services on top of the slowly ossifying Bitcoin base layer. This Era will see the replacement of the “Old Guard” by a newer generation of more business-savvy Bitcoin entrepreneurs and through merger and acquisition activity.</p><p>There will also be a lot of vertical and horizontal integration, as companies aim to achieve a “full-stack”. One example of all this is Layer1 mining, in what is effectively an electricity utility that also mines, and designs and fabricates ASIC miners.</p><p>It is impossible to predict what’s specifically going to happen during this 4 year era, let alone in the first year of it, but if the past 18 months are anything to go by, security, privacy, and most importantly going forward, UI/UX, will improve dramatically. I’d expect that running a full-sovereignty stack (your own VPN, node, electrum &amp; BTCPay servers, multi-sig setup, etc.) will be easy enough for almost anyone to do at the end of The Era. Effectively, Bitcoin’s infrastructure will be developed enough to handle some proper scale.</p><p>What will be most interesting thing to see will be the technological, economic and political developments during this Era. In this regard, everything is “Good for Bitcoin”. Internet access, computers and smartphones become cheaper and more accessible? This is good for Bitcoin. Never ending quantitative easing and negative interest rates? This is good for Bitcoin. Increased political turmoil, censorship, or surveillance? This is good for Bitcoin.</p><p>Should Bitcoin “stay in business”, risk level at this point would be medium-to-high, and you could expect to be exposed to weekly swings of +/-15%, but maybe not as regularly as in Series A.</p><p>When looked at in conjunction with some economic models like the Stock-to-Flow model, there is little reason to think a 10x growth in market cap will not be seen in this series, as per the 3 series preceding it. This would mean a series-end market cap of about USD$1 trillion, or, around USD$50k per bitcoin. Chances are that the All-time-high price achieved during this series will be dramatically higher than the end price, as this is the main driver of the “investment-to-utility” loop.</p>Series C — Scale (5th Reward Era, Apr 2024 — Mar 2028)<blockquote>Businesses that make it to Series C funding sessions are already quite successful. Series C funding is focused on scaling the company, growing as quickly and as successfully as possible. (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>Inflation is finally starting to drop, with only ~650,000 BTC needing to be absorbed by the market over the 4-year period — the inflation rate is now lower than that of Gold. Scarcity is becoming a more dominant element of Bitcoin’s value proposition.</p><p>With basically all the infrastructure largely built, and UI/UX continuing to improve, this Era is “The Era of The Evangelist”. Bitcoin is ready for prime time; somebody just has to go out and tell everybody. This Series’ fund raising round made all the right people very wealthy (if they weren’t already wealthy from the Series B raise), and these people will begin to use their influence (i.e. money) to promote Bitcoin, and increase the “saver-base”, i.e., the number of people who buy bitcoin on a weekly basis, or, earn their living in Bitcoin.</p><p>At this stage, to maintain a USD$500k price, about 10 million people are each saving USD$150/wk in Bitcoin. This represents 0.2% of the world’s adult population. Considering the level of utility and the seamlessness of the UI/UX in the late stages of this series, only 10 million active savers may even feel like a failure of sorts! From here, it is simply an exercise of marketing.</p>medium.com/media/da4a47f6535454fc2f34dc44828543b6/hrefIPO (6th Reward Era, Mar 2028 — Feb 2032), and beyond…<p>At this point, if Bitcoin is still alive, it is effectively unkillable. Major banks have now made big acquisitions, and are offering bitcoin services to their customers. Most power utilities have skin in the Bitcoin game. People won’t know that they’re using Bitcoin — and we’ll probably have 4 (or even 5) layers on top of Bitcoin now. On-chain base-layer transactions are reserved for high value transactions, all people adopting Bitcoin going forward won’t be onboarded via the base layer. The Bitcoin ETF has FINALLY been approved after an 18 year effort. Price per coin is in the millions, and fairly stable (to the downside, at least). Number still go up — just as designed.</p><p>It’s improper to say that it is “zero risk” in 2032, but the risk is extremely low. That said, if it gets to a 7th Era, I’d be comfortable enough to say that Bitcoin may become the first ever truly risk-free asset, with inflation rapidly approaching zero. I’ll be 50 years old by the end of Era 7, so I’m literally betting my career that this will be the case. Talk about skin in the game!</p>♦

  <p>by Ross Ulbricht</p>♦<p>I wasn’t expecting to write again so soon because there have been no significant price changes yet that affect our analysis from the previous post. However, I found the reaction by the news media to “Bitcoin by Ross” to be interesting because it illustrates a point I brought up here. In that post, I said the following:</p><blockquote>Many look to the news to get an idea of why prices have been going up or down and to find the reasons for why they’ll be higher or lower in the future. This is counter productive because the news is caught up in the same cycles as investors, so you’ll see good news and rosy projections at price peaks, with bad news and projections near lows.</blockquote><p>The reaction from the news to “Bitcoin by Ross” was overwhelmingly positive and optimistic. However, I was very careful to point out in my posts that the optimistic forecast was just one possibility, and even it calls for just one more relatively small advance in prices before transitioning to a massive bear market. Here’s what I said at the end of my last post:</p><blockquote>Whether we are in it now (our second scenario), or there is one more stab into new highs with wave (5) (our first scenario), wave II will come. As noted, it will likely be accompanied by extreme pessimism and antagonism toward Bitcoin. Long-time hodlers may capitulate and sell out. Businesses and governments may reject it. Some may call it “dead.” But so long as bitcoins are still being traded and the system remains technically sound, the end of wave II could be the best buying opportunity we will see for a very long time, perhaps ever again.</blockquote><p>By all accounts, this is a very pessimistic outlook for the medium term. I put forth some ideas in that same post about wave II taking prices as low as $1,500. Yet nearly all of the news coverage was about the possibility of an advance to ~$100,000. For example:</p><p>“Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht makes $100k Bitcoin price prediction”</p><p>“Silk Road Darknet Marketplace Founder: BTC Will Reach $100,000 in 2020”</p><p>“Bitcoin Set to Shatter $100K in 2020, Says Ross Ulbricht”</p><p>Because the news is caught up in the same cycles of optimism and pessimism as everyone else, taking it at face value will only draw you into those cycles as well. A better way to see the news is as an indicator of current levels of optimism and pessimism. The fact that coverage of “Bitcoin by Ross” has been so optimistic tells us we are closer to a peak in prices than we are to a low, and there is more downside than upside potential.</p><p>This does not rule out the $100,000 scenario. That may be the peak we are close to. $100,000 is only 5x more than the all-time high of ~$20,000. Bitcoin has seen multiple price advances on the order of 500x (as noted here), so a price of $100,000 is not as dramatic as it seems.</p><p>But the optimistic reaction from the news should make us more cautious and give a little more weight to the pessimistic scenario from our previous posts: that the price may fall below the recent low of $3,200 before it rises above the $20,000 peak.</p>♦

  <p>Prices and the market are intricately intertwined</p>♦I recommend reading this article while listening to “Strix Aluco” by “Isan”Prices reflect information<blockquote>“In a free market economic system, prices are knowledge, and the signals that communicate information. Prices are not simply a tool to allow capitalists to profit; they are the information system of economic production, communicating knowledge across the world and coordinating the complex processes of production.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Saifedean Ammous</blockquote><p>Prices are the coordinating force of a free market system. Each individual decision-maker can rely on the prices of goods and services to help with their decision making, as the prices themselves are a distillation of all known market information into a single metric. In other words, the compression of all relevant data is ultimately manifested as price (for the more technie minded, it’s a one-way hash function).</p><p>Each individual’s buy and sell decisions, in turn, further shape prices that carry this altered information back out into the market. Some of you may have heard of this from “Efficient market hypothesis” which is about how information in the market is reflected in the price of assets like equities.</p>Money is the measuring stick<blockquote>“Money is the central information utility of the world economy. As a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account, money is the critical vessel of information about the conditions of markets.</blockquote><blockquote>Capitalist economies are not equilibrium systems but dynamic domains of entrepreneurial experiments. Money should be a standard of measure for the outcomes of entrepreneurial experiments.” — George Gilder</blockquote><p>The essence of Capitalism is all about the efficient allocation of capital given the constraints of scarce resources and time. Companies are experiments on how to best allocate capital, and money is the standard measure for efficiency. Making money represents the efficient allocation of capital, losing money is not an efficient use of capital. And competition means decentralized planning by many separate companies and people to solve a problem in the market.</p>♦Capitalism, much like nature, is about experimentationInformation is Decentralized<p>“A centrally planned economy could never match the efficiency of the open market because what is known by a single agent is only a small fraction of the sum total of knowledge held by all members of society” — Hayek (Hayek’s “Local Knowledge Problem”). A decentralized economy thus complements the dispersed nature of information spread throughout society. Each company is an attempt to take the local knowledge that it has and create a good or service that ultimately is the correct capital allocation (aka profit).</p><p>To highlight how decentralized this information is, I’m going to give an example by Milton Friedman who made the statement: “There’s not a single person in the world who knows how to make a pencil:</p><ul><li>The wood comes from a tree</li><li>To cut down that tree, it took a saw</li><li>To make the saw, it took steel. To make steel, it took iron ore</li><li>Graphite, comes from some mines in South America</li><li>The eraser, which is rubber, probably comes from the tropics</li><li>Or the yellow paint</li><li>Or the glue that holds it together</li></ul><p>There was no central planning office. It was the magic of the price system.”</p>♦Praxeology. The study of Human Action.Central banks have an unsolvable data problem<p>Central banks inherently have a data problem. There’s an ingestion, processing, decision bottleneck — same as any electronic signal processing system. An economy cannot be planned by a central authority, because there is no way that a central authority can have all of the necessary knowledge to make the best decision at any single point in time, let alone all points in time.</p><blockquote>“It is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality” — Hayek</blockquote><p>To operate effectively, central banks would have to ingest trillions of data points daily, and ingest those data points in a perfect manner which is impossible. Every single uber taken, every single sandwich purchased, every single in-app purchase.</p><blockquote>“We need to believe we live in a predictable, controllable world, so we turn to authoritative-sounding people who promise to satisfy that need.” — Philip Tetlock</blockquote><p>We’ve created central banks because we want the world to make sense, and we want to feel that there is someone in charge. Even if we were able to ingest perfect data, it is hard to infer simple causality for this complex, chaotic system which involves billions of decision makers. While determining the relationship between weather and crops might seem easy, how do we determine the causality of burrito demand? Economics isn’t like the sciences, we are hamstrung by small or incomplete sample sizes. We can’t re-run the Dot com bubble with a different central bank or a different President.</p><p>This brings us to how central banks measure impact and make decisions. There is a classic product saying that goes “If you can’t measure it you can’t manage it.” It’s hard to even measure a kilogram with extreme precision, so how could we possibly measure inflation properly? (ex: CPI excludes food and energy!)</p><p>“Since big events come out of nowhere, forecasts may do more harm than good, giving the illusion of predictability in a world where unforeseen events control most outcomes (Aka black swan events)” — Carl Richards</p><p>He goes on to say “Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything.” Daniel Kahneman also has a great take on the dangers of using history as our guide:</p><blockquote>“Hindsight, the ability to explain the past, gives us the illusion that the world is understandable. It gives us the illusion that the world makes sense, even when it doesn’t make sense. That’s a big deal in producing mistakes in many fields.”</blockquote><p>Here’s a useful analogy: Essentially the Fed is driving the car, which is the economy, only using the rearview mirror which is foggy, and the front windshield is opaque (you can’t see the future). How could the Fed possibly drive the car with any accuracy? What if we just let the car self adjust to the conditions of the road?</p><p>History cannot be interpreted without the aid of imagination and intuition. The sheer quantity of evidence is so overwhelming that selection is inevitable.</p><p>So what is our alternative?</p>Sound Money<blockquote>“Sound money is the equivalent of scientific integrity: the system must not permit the manipulation of data after the experiment has taken place.” — George Gilder</blockquote><p>Sound money keeps the ruler settings fixed so results cannot be altered by a centralized planning mechanism.</p><p>And Bitcoin is the perfect iteration of sound money. Bitcoin has a hard cap for several reasons: being a precise measuring stick, reducing political attack vectors, and encouraging speculative bubbles which act as a viral loop.</p><p>But why 21M? Why not 100M?</p><p>Here’s the secret…It doesn’t matter! It’s precise length is irrelevant. What matters is just that there is a fixed amount. As economic activity moves from a primitive scale, it becomes harder for individuals to make decisions without having a fixed unit of account with which to compare value.</p><p>Regarding political attack vectors, Satoshi felt that setting a “proper” rate of inflation rate was impossible so he decided to remove human decision making from the process. Satoshi has two quotes regarding fixed supply that support this conclusion:</p><blockquote>“Indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don’t know a way for software to know the real world value of things.”</blockquote><p>Satoshi also says</p><blockquote>“If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.”</blockquote><p>Finally, Satoshi hypothesized that a fixed supply might create speculative bubbles.</p><p>“As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.”</p>Implications of Sound Money<p>Bitcoin is the ultimate safe haven asset. As more and more people buy into Bitcoin and that narrative, it becomes the de facto risk off asset.</p><p>Post hyperbitcoiniation, when Bitcoin is the SoV, MoE, and UoA, Bitcoin will reflect the most accurate “risk free” rate of return that we’ve ever had, which enables the economy and market participants to most efficiently allocate resources. Each market participant, both individual investors and corporations, make the risk on/risk off decision which is then manifested in Bitcoin’s price.</p>♦<p>And finally, when Bitcoin is the unit of account and used by every business, market participants can view the flow of funds of their suppliers and customers in real time via their publicly disclosed Bitcoin addresses. This transparency makes markets ultra efficient through the best processing of information.</p><p>Bitcoin rearchitects how capital is efficiently allocated in our economy, ultimately creating a world with more abundance and resources for all.</p><p>By Dan Held,<br>Nov, 2019</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below.

  <p>Disclaimer: I have no current or future interest in a new cryptocurrency launch, either personally or professionally. This piece is intended generally as a thought experiment, and is NOT an endorsement of any specific project. I do not recommend or condone the creation of any new base-layer cryptocurrencies.</p>Foreword<p>The presence of ASICs in Proof of Work systems has always been deeply contentious. At maturity, ASICs enhance the security of the network (by forcing miners to take a long term stake in the success of the protocol), but in the transitional phase, the first hardware manufacturer to build ASICs has a near-monopoly on the minting of new coins. This can lead to the existence of an informal form of seigniorage — minting money at a discount to its market value. Protocols which fork frequently are also exposed to this risk; developers effectively have the ability to determine which PoW function the chain will move to, giving them the ability to monetize their influence over the protocol. This is a potentially very insidious form of corruption, and it impairs the ‘fairness’ quality that PoW is known for. GPU chains also have the undesirable quality of being ‘nicehash-able’ — that is, attackable by renting commodity hardware for a short period of time. There is no long-term bond required to mine a GPU coin, as the hardware is repurposable and salable.</p><p>Mindful of these issues, I started thinking last year about how an ASIC launch might work. Not because I have any interest in participating in one, but simply because I find it interesting to think about these tradeoffs. This culminated in this tweet:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>It&#39;s only a matter of time (&amp;lt;12 months) until we see a fair launch with an exotic PoW released by a dev team that has also made ASICs that work exclusively with that PoW. No details of the algorithm will be released until genesis block.</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@nic__carter</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>About a month later, Obelisk (a subsidiary of Nebulous) published their proposal for a commercial service, dubbed Launchpad, which could facilitate PoW launches with custom pre-built ASICs.</p><p>Introducing Obelisk Launchpad</p><p>I put my tweet in this article to demonstrate that I’ve been ruminating on these ideas for a long time, and I’m not writing this opportunistically to lend ‘moral support’ to any specific launch. I have had this piece mostly written for a long time, but I neglected it because I figured that PoW launches were essentially defunct and that there wouldn’t be a great deal of interest in them.</p><p>In fact, I was wrong about the timeline — no such launch that I am aware of occured in the 12-month period following the tweet. But it has come to my attention that a few teams are contemplating similar launches today. Thus I felt that my thoughts on this matter might be useful. Not for the benefit of any particular team, but because this gives us an interesting canvas to evaluate issues that are critical to the social scalability and security of these networks, whether it’s Bitcoin or other PoW chains.</p><p>If someone is intent on launching a new public blockchain, I firmly think non-premined PoW is the best way to do it, for a number of reasons, which I’ll get into later in the article. But I feel that GPU launches are increasingly more difficult and risky. I cannot stop anyone launching a chain. But I think a careful analysis of the tradeoffs might encourage teams to do things more responsibly, or, at the very least, explore other parts of the design space.</p><p>Lastly — some of you will be upset by my musings around how a new generic blockchain might be launched. If this is the case, I’d recommend simply closing the tab and disengaging. Additionally, while I think Bitcoin is likely sufficient as far as non-state monies go, I am also not willing to permanently rule out the potential emergence of some other PoW blockchain. I don’t see why we’d need another one now, but I find it hard to believe that Bitcoin is both the first and last viable blockchain ever to be created. I’m not afraid of competition, either. I think Bitcoin has its own unique merits, and smaller launches don’t compete with it or impair it in any way. Since it’s entirely possible to me that we do end up with another PoW chain at some point, it’s worth thinking about how to launch them.</p><p>Just so I’m absolutely clear on this: I’m not endorsing any specific launch or coin, or even new PoW launches generally. In fact, I would generally discourage anyone from launching a new blockchain. They tend to be boondoggles or ghost towns. But I am not ruling out the potential existence of a new blockchain at some point in the future.</p>Introduction<p>New cryptocurrency launches are beset by a strange paradox: they typically require a single, authoritative entity to spearhead development, to manage the process of launch, and coordinate development for a meaningful period throughout its infancy. Generally, a considerable amount of upfront investment in R&amp;D is required to create a differentiated protocol. All of these features tend to require the organizational and financial efforts of a single entity.</p><p>But of course the backing of a corporate entity (or the more subtle, let’s-pretend-there’s-no-organization-pulling-the-strings-here model) is a critical point of centralization. This means that adversaries have very obvious buttons to press if the protocol grows too big or disruptive; generally speaking, anyone hostile to the network will have an abundant ability to interfere with it. Additionally, these administrative entities often choose to retain not only a large fraction of supply, but also discretion over decision making, trademarks, and vetoes over future development directions. Much like Engels’ quote around the “withering state” as the end result of a socialist utopia, the claimed “path to decentralization” in monetary protocols is closer to rhetoric than reality.</p><p>To truly commit to surrendering power, the founders of these projects must be comfortable with austerity and eventual irrelevance. It’s sometimes said that Satoshi’s second most brilliant insight, behind creating Bitcoin, was leaving the project. Lamentably, virtually no cryptocurrency founders since have followed his lead, preferring filthy lucre and a shot at joining the Davos class, alongside their fellow central bankers.</p><p>Numerous models of protocol financing have been attempted over the years: the bitcointalk premine, the more sophisticated ICO, the founders reward, the covert premine and backdated whitepaper, the instamine, the merged fork. The purists will maintain that nothing other than a proof of work fair launch (ensuring no seigniorage, not even for the developers) is sufficient to confer the founding team with the legitimacy to create a worldwide protocol.</p><p>They have a point: it’s vanishingly unlikely that, if a meaningful portion of the world switches to a neutral cryptocurrency protocol, that future buyers of the coin would find it acceptable to enrich founders who allocated themselves 20% or more of this global currency for free. Seigniorage — more generally, the distinct feeling of unfairness, or being cheated — leaves a particularly nasty taste in one’s mouth. This, rather than any technical foibles, will be the doom of most of those sexy new high-TPS VC-backed base layer protocols. These aren’t startups: these are monies, competing on credibility, neutrality, institutional stability, and fairness. Private equity is concentrated and unfair, but you don’t need to use Uber stock to buy your daily bread. For something as essential as money, fairness is critical. A deeply unfair launch is an ugly miasma, lingering nastily, poisoning the authenticity of the project.</p><p>The singular appeal of a Proof of Work launch is not simply in the distributional advantage that at-home mining gets you (although this is a potent and underrated feature). No, the most important feature of the PoW fair launch is that it ensures that it is impossible to acquire coins for below market rate. You can purchase the coins on the market or with electricity; no one is entitled to an insider deal. Compare this to a dev team premining an ERC20 and then dripping it out on the market over a period of years. This looks cosmetically the same a PoW. But it’s not — because that team was able to acquire all the coins for $0. It would be similar to PoW if the dev team took the funds they received in exchange for the coins and set them on fire.</p><p>Of course, the disadvantage inherent in the ‘fair launch’ is the fact that it’s challenging to monetize the network, especially early on. This is fine if developers are happy to work idealistically or altruistically. In Bitcoin, patrons eventually emerged, as the network came to be systemically important. Today, a rich and diverse set of patrons subsidize dozens of core developers to keep the chain running smoothly and work on long term infrastructure. This is perhaps the ideal model; but Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first, the most critically important, and not having venture backers to reckon with. Today, any new cryptocurrency struggles to distinguish itself. Obtaining sufficient traction to survive on patronage or donations is a tall order. And as far as front-loaded R&amp;D goes, this is virtually impossible to finance without some sort of sale of future rights to protocol tokens. Many will point to the Grin case study here. Having made the somewhat anachronistic decision to aim for a proof of work fair launch targeted at GPUs, the Grin team struggled to monetize. Donations so far have been relatively scarce. A cautionary tale, to many.</p><p>Of course, those smugly deriding the weaknesses of the fair launch model tend to do so with the implicit intention of advertising straightforwardly exploitative launch models of their own. Let he who is without premine cast the first stone. Even though Grin has struggled for financing so far, its odds of becoming a significant monetary asset are not encumbered by securities laws issues, by the risk of the founder being arrested, or by the community becoming disenchanted as they are exploited by VCs dumping on them at the the first opportunity (For those who don’t believe me, read the fundraising decks of the crypto funds targeting token strategies. That language about low “time to liquidity” — that’s code for “we plan to exit our token positions at the public sale, because we want to secure a riskless return and dump this asset as soon as possible”).</p><p>The 2014–18 era ICO was, for the most part, a disastrous financial instrument. I have never come across a single one that I felt was issued responsibly to the public. Once these stopped being accessible to the general public, they lost their sole advantage: wide, permissionless distribution (note that this is a native feature of PoW). The issues with ICOs, especially those opting immediately for a proof of stake authority model (instead of a PoW bootstrapping, as Ethereum wisely opted for), are numerous:</p><ul><li>Insiders can purchase their own crowdsale, and covertly obtain an arbitrarily high fraction of supply for free (because they also get to collect the funds committed to the crowdsale)</li><li>Buyers can obtain tokens for arbitrarily low prices, since they are not created in a costly manner through proof of work, but summoned out of thin air. Thus, the private rounds that predate public sales often consist of pure seigniorage</li><li>Tokens often end up being a bizarre mishmash of an informal investment contract, and an arcade token for unlocking network resources. This causes speculation to crowd out usage and leads to very confused theories of value accrual</li><li>Tokens sold to the public (or done obliquely, a la Telegram) closely resemble investment contracts in most sensible jurisdictions, and this tends to make the issuers subject to securities laws, whether they like it or not</li><li>Issuers that retain a large fraction of supply tend to retain authority in the network, especially if a Proof of Stake model is opted for. This hampers the path to decentralizing authority, as issuers tend to resist divesting their share of the network</li><li>Early backers can obtain disproportionate shares of supply for essentially free, and then costlessly retain that advantage in perpetuity if the network follows a PoS model. This is a potent force which chills the dispersion of tokens, as stakers are not compelled to sell. In PoW, by contrast, miners must constantly spend and invest to retain proportional network authority. In PoS, retaining stake is simply the cost of running a server</li></ul><p>My central point is this: the principal challenge in the administration of a new monetary commodity is not a technical one. Of course, your blockchain must have compelling technical features. But ultimately the difficulty lies in climbing the wall of indifference. At inception, no one cares about your system. At maturity, you need tens and possibly hundreds of millions of individuals to care. If you give early investors discounted access to a significant fraction of supply, and then give them powerful anti-dilution rights (while hoping/expecting that future individuals will use your network as working capital and tolerate some dilution, in effect subsidizing the early buyers who passively stake), you risk creating a patently unfair system in which the winners are a function of the arbitrary prehistory of the chain.</p><p>Attracting anyone to a network like this strikes me as profoundly unlikely. Why your chain? Why not an equivalent fair launch, where every owner worked for their coins, instead of receiving an allocation through some proximity to the founding team?</p><p>But, ICOs, premines, and founder-tax coins have a crucial advantage: the ability to subsidize work on the protocol, even prior to its launch. Naively presuming that, in 2019, not all the cryptocurrency protocols that will ever exist have already been launched, one might go as far as to say that subsidizing work on a protocol prior to its launch might be a desirable property. So can one mix and match the desirable qualities of a coin launch while avoiding the worst of them? I certainly think so. Let’s review three popular models:</p>♦<p>Certainly more cons than pros in this case. In the U.S., selling rights to a cryptocurrency, especially to the general public, seems to be out of favor with our securities regulators. Not recommended. Additionally, giving early backers or big holders permanent, cheap-to-exercise anti-dilution rights dulls the dispersion of tokens, limiting its reach. We have fairly good data on this, thanks to the transparency that blockchains offer us. (I’d love to see a serious piece of work comparing the dispersion of ownership in PoS chains versus PoW chains. If you’re a researcher who is interested in taking this on, get in touch! I have data.)</p>♦<p>A classic. The Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and Grin model. A sensible approach, but difficult to bootstrap support, and reliant on community funding or patronage for ongoing support. Very effective and hard to kill if you can pull it off — but it requires a huge amount of community building to get traction. These appear to be getting less and less viable with time, especially as the financial stakes have grown. I’d expect that virtually all GPU launches today would be subject to the risk of insiders with prior knowledge of the algorithm covertly creating ASICs.</p>♦<p>This this hybrid model, pioneered by Zcash. This is essentially equivalent to a vested premine. It better aligns incentives than a pure premine, as the allocations are not unlocked for a number of years. Nevertheless, the proposal has issues of its own: in the case of Zcash, the protocol has been racked with controversy over whether the administrator should receive additional protocol-derived funding. The spigot of seigniorage is very hard to turn off, once active.</p><p>At this point, you might be wondering why I don’t simply agitate for vanilla PoW fair launches. By this rubric they seem plainly superior. But they aren’t without their issues. I think it’s worth being realistic about GPU PoW launches. Let’s look at a couple recent case studies.</p>Why GPU fair launches might be a thing of the past<p>As someone who followed the Grin launch rather closely, I must admit that it felt like a nostalgic last foray into a prior era. I got a decidedly Proustian pang from watching the process play out. As if I had dipped my madeleine in the tea and been transported back to the glory days of PoW launches from 2012–14.</p><p>The gossip going around about “$100m in VC-backed SPVs” was hyperbolic, but the launch certainly had problems. Initially hoping to stay ASIC-resistant in perpetuity, the developers ultimately opted for a pragmatic GPU-to-ASIC phased approach, envisioning a slow transition to an ASIC dominated network, but hoping for some more widely accessible GPU mining to begin with. There was a period of GPU mining, but some miners are now reporting to me that ASICs, or at least more efficient hardware (FPGAs), have begun to take a significant share of hashrate, somewhat ahead of the desired schedule. This isn’t exactly a failure, but it does illustrate the colossal difficulty inherent in the notion of ASIC resistance.</p><p>You are creating an enormous bounty for anyone to anticipate the PoW change, or to lobby the developers for a favorable outcome. The Grin developers did dither a little bit on the ultimate model for PoW (this was naturally a rather fraught discussion) and this ambiguity caused a lot of gnashing of teeth and lobbying efforts. It would have been far more efficient, overall, if resources had not been allocated to lobbying developers for a favorable hash function. Ultimately, the devs took extreme care to make the chain hostile to ASICs at inception, but they couldn’t stem the flow. They didn’t opt for ASICs right away due to a naive view that GPUs would dominate for the early history of Grin (and the difficulty coordinating this model with a distributed, non-corporate team), but ASICs (or at least FPGAs) appeared anyway.</p><p>Most ASIC resistant chains are beset by this same difficulty. They effectively create a massive bounty for teams to create FPGAs or ASICs and fly below the radar, hoping they aren’t discovered. Su Zhu says it well here:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>Every coin which is targeting GPU-mining is being stealth FPGA-mined at the very least, if not ASIC-mined already.

Let’s revisit what we’d like to optimize for:</p><ul><li>we’d like to limit seigniorage; that is, we want virtually every participant to have the ability to obtain the tokens at market price, with relatively few exceptions to this rule</li><li>we want the distribution period to be as long as possible</li><li>if being an early backer of the network does confer an advantage, it should be a temporary one and erode over time</li><li>a position of authority in the system should be costly to retain; it should not be costless to exert influence in perpetuity</li><li>being an early backer of the network should not grant you permanent anti-dilution rights</li><li>we want the system to work under existing securities laws in the U.S.: we want to disentangle the investment contract from the asset issued by the protocol</li><li>we want the network to be secure at inception (from a crypto-economic perspective)</li><li>we want the founding team to be able to meaningfully divest power and authority from the network; and</li><li>we want to inculcate a feeling of fairness and to minimize information asymmetries surrounding the network launch</li></ul><p>I believe virtually all of these qualities can be obtained in a model that has not been tried before:</p>The ASIC presale model<p>The basic idea is:</p><ol><li>Some developers create a new cryptocurrency protocol.</li><li>To finance this, they sell rights not to tokens, but to physical ASICs</li><li>Together with trusted supply chain partners, they manufacture these ASICs ahead of launch</li><li>These ASICs are sold to investors or, better yet, to the community of users who want to explicitly support the network in its early days.

As we learn more about the PoW security model, it’s clear that all but the largest GPU-mined networks are simply unsafe. Ethereum is probably an exception because it accounts for such a large fraction of the world’s GPUs, and they cannot be sold or rented in sufficient numbers. Aside from the structurally difficulty of acquiring sufficient hash power, this means that successfully attacking Ethereum would cause the value of GPUs worldwide to depreciate, which is a strong disincentive for any attacker. Aside from Ethereum though, most GPU mined coins are exposed to this risk of rented hardware being used to attack the chain, and we’ve seen copious examples of this. If you believe that dedicated hardware helps with security, then you will prefer the ASIC model. This approach gives you ironclad security from inception.</p>The investment contract-like element is firmly disentangled from the actual coins<p>In the case of an ICO, you have tokens which are presold to buyers. If these are understood to be investment contracts, or securities, this potentially compromises the entire supply of tokens, and inhibits their ability to circulate on exchanges. In an attempt to circumvent this, it has been argued that the investment contract covers only rights for future tokens, and that the tokens themselves are not the subjects of the investment contract. It’s under this reasoning that the ETH in the presale are understood to have likely been the subject of an investment contract, but the outstanding units of ETH at delivery of the blockchains were not themselves securities. I don’t really buy this distinction — at the very least, I find it tortured. I find it easier to simply distinguish the two.</p><p>In the case of the ASIC presale, you very clearly distinguish the investment contract from the coins themselves. If there’s anything which is security-like, it’s the ASIC sold to investors (although, as noted, it’s entirely possible that these aren’t even securities, as end users have to actually operate them and feed them with electricity, obviating the ‘efforts of third parties’ prong of Howey). The actual coins themselves are totally in the clear, in my opinion, since they are issued by the protocol in the manner of a conventional fair launch. I think we have copious evidence that fair launch tokens are not understood to be securities by the SEC. This gives potential users really convenient assurances that the trading of the asset won’t suddenly be restricted to security token trading venues. This is one of the greatest advantages of the model.</p>You get PoW distribution AND developers can finance themselves in a limited capacity<p>The distributional advantages of PoW have, to date, not been very well documented, but I have a strong intuition that they lead to better dispersion of supply. Relative to the vanilla PoW launch, developers can also finance R&amp;D and administrative costs involved in launching a new chain. And they’re not violating securities law. Sweet!</p>You get an arbitrarily long distribution period<p>Many have noticed that, as far as new monies are concerned, the existence of temporal contingency in distribution introduces an arbitrariness which limits the dispersion of the currency. In other words — short issuances (some ICOs were over in minutes) guarantee that the supply will be highly concentrated. Longer issuances give everyone a shot at obtaining the units of coins. This was part of the intuition behind the yearlong EOS ICO, which was a rather clever idea (aside from the fact that the crowdsale wallets had continuous outflows during that time, leading to conspiracies about recycling treasury funds back into the ICO). If you think about it, the EOS yearlong tokensale was somewhat akin to a PoW launch (with the exception being that the coins contributed to the crowdsale were not burned). Proof of Work gives you an extended permissionless distribution phase, although the decaying block reward means that new supply is much more abundant early on. Bitcoin’s issuance will last over 100 years, but over 80% of all Bitcoins have already been mined.</p><p>Comparing a PoW launch to a generic ICO, it’s very clear that permissionless access in a newly-launched ICO is impossible. Tezos straddled this transition, following a no-KYC crowdsale with a subsequent forced KYC process to unlock user Tezzies. I would imagine that all subsequent ICOs (to the extent that they do occur) will follow suit. The difference with PoW is that you are acquiring coins from a protocol. While ASIC suppliers might ask for KYC, generally speaking, mining is a much less permissioned environment than ICOs or crowdsales. Add in the reality that electricity is much more globally available than access to capital markets, and PoW looks very attractive. A protocol retailing off coins in exchange for electricity over a long period of time is an extremely potent means to issue an asset to a global audience. No one has devised a better way so far.</p>The rules of the game are very clear<p>One of the biggest issues with PoW chains in this day and age is ambiguity, especially around changing hash functions. When you have ambiguity, you have debate, and lobbying, and the possibility for developers to exploit their privileged status within the system. This is generally disastrous, and reduces social scalability, as well of the credibility of the system. If a small group of individuals if found to be abusing their protocol access to monetize, the system’s credibility is compromised. One alternative is to simply set the PoW function and commit to never changing it (this is essentially what Bitcoin has opted for, and why Bitcoin should never change its PoW unless something catastrophic occurs). That’s what this model calls for. No debate; no lobbying; no covert exploitation.</p>The initial advantage depreciates over time, providing the system with natural dispersion<p>Unlike something like a PoS token sold in a presale, the initial balance of power in the ASIC launch system changes dramatically over time. Initially, a select few have near-monopoly rights on supply. But this is a temporally limited advantage, and the appearance of new ASICs, or even simply the passage of time, and the depreciation that that brings, erodes that initial advantage. I want to emphasise that I consider this a good feature. Too much power granted to the early stakeholders in the network — plus the ability to retain this power, costlessly, in perpetuity, is a dysgenic feature. This massively inhibits the dispersion of the holder base. The presence of PoW is useful here. It induces constant selling on the part of miners, reducing their protocol-proximate privilege. The same cannot be said for staking. While in the case of the ASIC launch we have a privileged few early on, their advantage rapidly depreciates.</p><p>Let’s unite everything in a big chart, to compare how the alternative launch methods deal with various downsides.</p>♦<p>While I think this is an interesting and attractive model for a new launch, there are certainly some open questions still, especially as we’ve never seen it done in the wild. These are some of mine:</p><ul><li>is it possible to extract a margin on ASICs sufficient to render this a profitable enterprise?</li><li>what is the shape of the supply curve such that the temporary monopoly on supply would be considered acceptable to future users?</li><li>how can ASIC buyers have confidence that no additional ASICs were covertly created?</li><li>can one-shot financing be sufficient to bootstrap a business building an open source protocol?</li><li>is the limited amount of seigniorage disqualifying in terms of creating a monetary asset?</li><li>are the ASICs themselves investment contracts/securities, or are they in the clear?</li><li>is it possible to build an ASIC supply chain that doesn’t concentrate with one or two entities having unilateral control over the hardware production process?</li></ul><p>What do you think? Worth trying or a pointless waste of time? I’m curious to hear your thoughts. I feel that launch methods are generally under-covered, so I hope that this post kicks off some discussion, regardless of whether this model is considered viable.</p>Objections<p>I will consider a few objections here.</p>If you applied this model to Bitcoin, six months of mining would represent 1.3m BTC, which is an excessively large fraction of supply<p>You can tune the shape of the supply curve however you like, to give the monopolists in those first 4–6 months an arbitrary fraction of supply. You could design the curve such that they get 0.1% of supply or 99.5% of supply. I think an issuer would probably aim to target something like 5–10% of supply for that initial period, but that’s a totally wild guess.</p>Why do you expect that the initial batch of ASICs will last 4–6 months? Why wouldn’t they last essentially forever and give ASIC buyers a permanent advantage?<p>If the protocol actually ends up being relatively significant, market cap-wise, then ASIC manufacturers will inevitably jump in and make ASICs for it. From conversations with ASIC manufacturers that I know, the shortest period it takes to make a useful ASIC for a new cryptocurrency algorithm is about four months, although I would happily take expert input here. FPGAs in this example wouldn’t suffice, because the existence of ASICs at inception means there’s a relatively high bar to clear in terms of competitive hardware. Either way, the point remains — I fully expect that the first miners would be met with competition within six months at the latest.</p>The ASICs in this example actually aren’t securities<p>This isn’t exactly an objection but I wanted to address it anyway. I’ll admit I don’t know the answer here. You definitely have to mix the ASICs with your own labor (and electricity) to get a return, so their value doesn’t purely derive from the efforts of a third party. I am just vaguely guessing that the ASICs might resemble an investment contract. I am not a lawyer. This isn’t legal advice. Either way, if they weren’t securities, that would be even better for the model. We’re trying to avoid violating securities law, remember.</p>The issuers are giving ASIC manufacturers total power. They could create extra ASICs and cheat the process<p>This is definitely a risk, so the ASIC manufacturers must be contractually bound or closely trusted by the issuing team. The risk is that they covertly create too many ASICs. There are potential ways of mitigating this. I haven’t put a lot of thought into it, but I feel like the team could set up a protocol similar to google authenticator where they give miners ciphertext to include in coinbase outputs for the first few months, to ensure that the blocks being mined are being created only by ASICs which are accounted for. I’m not sure. I think someone clever could come up with a better way to ensure that only members of a permissioned set of ASICs is permitted to mine for the period in which they have a temporary monopoly.</p>We don’t need any more blockchains. Stop helping people figure out how to issue new cryptocurrencies<p>I basically agree, but I’m not going to stop exploring these issues just because you don’t like the idea of new coins existing. We may well discover a reason to create another blockchain at some point. Who knows.</p>This launch is actually quite unfair, as you’re suggesting creating a premine<p>Definitionally, this isn’t a premine. There is no “prior mine”. (I’ll admit that quibbling over definitions misses the point). What we have are the issuers monetizing their informational advantage. They know what hash function will be used, and they are selling that information in the form of purpose-built hardware. The mining is up to whoever the ASICs are sold to. They do get a temporary monopoly. Think of it like a taxi medallion which decomposes after six months. It’s clearly unfair. But having observed the Grin launch, and the ProgPoW debate, and the many Monero and Vertcoin “ASIC-resistance” hard forks, it’s very clear to me that developers are extremely susceptible to lobbying over PoW. I would prefer that the hash function is never changed, so that the rules of the game are fixed and the returns to lobbying are 0.</p><p>So in this case we have a transparently unfair model, as contrasted with a (potential) covertly unfair situation which people naively think is fair. The latter would be disastrous. Imagine a chain which was ASIC resistant, forked to a new PoW, for which it later emerged that the developers had custom-designed hardware, while everyone else mined with GPUs. This would constitute an exploitation of the community, and a breach of trust. This is entirely possible within the framework of ASIC-resistant coins, and I expect it to happen at some point. I’m proposing a situation with temporally limited unfairness, which decomposes over time, and becomes pretty explicitly fair thereafter.</p>Developers shouldn’t monetize. They should work on these things altruistically. Otherwise you cannibalize intrinsic motivation<p>I pretty much agree! I think that one of the most perverse outcomes with protocol-funded rewards is that FOSS developers lose their incentive to contribute to the protocol, leaving it all to the professionals who are paid directly from that protocol-funded spigot. This essentially turns a FOSS project into a corporate one, obviating all the advantages of using FOSS in the first place.</p><p>This specific configuration is a very limited monetization. The developers sell ASICs at the price that the market will tolerate, and that’s the only chance they have to directly monetize their protocol access. Later on, they can think about adopting the Red Hat/ COSS / Blockstream model, where they monetize their protocol-specific expertise. But this model also empowers the initial issuers/developers to exit the project without destroying it. Because they do not have permanent authority in the network, as would be the case with an issuing team retaining a large fraction of PoS tokens, for instance.</p>Developers can’t sufficiently monetize under this configuration<p>Excessive developer monetization of a monetary protocol they develop is a very dangerous thing, in my opinion. At a certain threshold you have an operation which is primarily dedicated to extracting rent, rather than delivering computational services at commodity prices. Anything developers to do abuse their authority in the system — including extracting value in excess of the minimum required (which may well be 0) — undermines its credibility and raises the likelihood of users leaving for a less extractive system. I am generally of the belief that no protocol-funded monetization whatsoever is optimal. But if there is to be some, I would tolerate it under the conditions that it is temporary, limited, and does not give the developers permanent authority within the system. This meets those restrictions.</p>It’s too expensive to launch in this manner. Issuers won’t be able to sufficiently finance themselves<p>This is a fair critique. Instead of creating the tokens for ~free and selling them, developers have to literally create hardware and sell it. ASICs are generally quite expensive. I suppose it might vary on the type, but a decent run will cost millions of dollars. So the issuers will need to be able to charge a sufficiently high price to extract a margin. This has the interesting effect of “pricing” the offering.</p><p>If the ASICs are expected to have a monopoly on issuance in the first six months, and 10 percent of supply will be issued in that period, the value of the fully diluted supply will roughly be 10 times what buyers pay for the ASICs. This establishes a floor for the required valuation of a project for issuers to be able to monetize in this manner. Let’s say it costs $5m to create a run of 1000 ASICs (it may well be much more — I don’t know much about hardware). Developers need to collect a decent chunk to finance R&amp;D, let’s say another $5m. So they need to be able to retail the ASICs for $10m collectively, or $10,000 each. Let’s also say they decide to issue 10% of supply in the first 6 months and they think the ASICs will hold up for that period. This means that the chain has to be priced by the market at a $100m valuation in the aggregate (at the time of the ASIC sale) for the issuers to collect sufficient margins.</p>Why go through all this trouble to launch in this convoluted way? Why not just do an ICO and retain a treasury for long term incentive alignment?<p>First of all, ICOs appear to be a violation of securities law in virtually every sensible jurisdiction. Going “offshore” probably won’t be enough, as many issuers will likely discover in 2020. This post is a proposal for an alternative to the PoW ‘fair’ launch, and the claim is that it improves along a couple directions. It’s not an alternative to ICOs. I believe that in today’s day and age (really anytime post the SEC DAO Report (released July 2017)), ICOs are largely unworkable from a regulatory perspective. Additionally, I think the ICO launch method will have a very hard time creating lasting monies.</p><p>This is still a hypothesis, but I strongly feel that the most important trait of a novel monetary system is a widely dispersed ownership. It starts with a GINI of 1 and its objective is to get to a reasonable level of dispersion with time. Now I don’t mean perfect equality of outcome — such a thing is impossible, and it’s unclear how that would even work. Every adult in 2019 receiving an equal entitlement to a share of the new monetary system? What about future humans? Unborn children? Even if mechanically possible, a global UBI would still be exposed to immense temporal contingency — privileging the interests of people today.</p><p>Airdrops don’t appear to work very well. Stellar’s attempt to distribute their coins as widely as possible has been a truly dismal failure. Something received for free tends not to be valued by the recipient. No surprise. Proof of Work is a potentially superior system. Miners must work for their share. They must commit time and effort to mining. This distribution method is truly underappreciated. If Ethereum succeeds, it will be in large part because it was mineable for 5+ years on commodity GPUs. Delaying the switch to PoS (which I argue above dulls the dispersion of coins) was a saving grace, in my opinion. As stated, this is still just an intuition. But I feel that PoW’s distributional qualities are very underrated. Many of these closely held monetary protocols will face the sisyphean task of getting users to store value in their currency.</p>ASIC manufacturing is a concentrated industry where foundry allocations and political connections determine the winners. You are ensuring the ASIC manufacturers will be kingmakers here<p>It’s true that cryptocurrency ASIC manufacturing is currently rather oligopolistic. For a rather eye-opening take on how the industry operates from a U.S. based ASIC manufacturer, read David Vorick’s take here. What’s interesting about the ASIC launch is that is actually strips power from the big manufacturers like Bitmain, and restores it to the issuers of the coin. A fair GPU launch just sets of an arms race among the big ASIC manufacturers over who can build ASICs fastest. When they get there, they intensely lobby the team to not change the algo (see the ProgPoW debate in Ethereum).</p><p>In this situation, the team works with an ASIC manufacturer of their choice to create ASICs for launch, and ASIC manufacturers then have the opportunity to make chain-specific hardware subsequently. What is very clear is that the early returns to mining will not accrue to the big ASIC manufacturers. If they exist, they will accrue to the community members who purchased the ASICs from the issuers. This is overall a significant improvement. I’ll add that there’s an awkward transition that virtually every ASIC resistant chain has to and will make as they eventually capitulate and embrace ASICs. Choosing to trumpet ASIC resistance, coordinating a couple hard forks, and eventually accepting the inevitability of ASICs is to create a huge amount of ambiguity that ASIC manufacturers can and do exploit. I much prefer a game where the rules are explicit from day 0.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the possibility to create ASICs which aren’t as exposed to supply chain idiosyncrasies that SHA-256 ASICs currently require. The kingmakers for Bitcoin ASICs are the foundries, which privilege the big ASIC manufacturers who can pre-pay for access and compete for allocations. Some alternative technologies like optical Proof of Work purport to inculcate a fairer ASIC manufacturing processes. I haven’t independently verified this, but this is the claim. If so, ASICs of that sort would be easier to mass-produce in a greater variety of settings.</p>Any amount of seigniorage is disqualifying<p>I am not entirely sure that I would call this seigniorage, as it’s entirely possible that ASIC buyers lose money and end up effectively paying $1.10 for each dollar that they mint. It’s not guaranteed seigniorage, at least. ASIC buyers are taking on a degree of risk. That said, if the model works well, ASIC buyers will be minting coins below market rate — if there wasn’t the possibility of doing that, they wouldn’t participate. So there is potential seigniorage. If you feel that even the slightest amount of seigniorage permanently ruins the credibility of the project, this model won’t work for you. But if you feel, as I do, that a small amount of seigniorage can be very useful, even if it trades off against credibility, you might find this model attractive.</p>Why are you wasting your time thinking about this? We already have Bitcoin and we don’t need any new chains<p>I reserve the right to think and write about whatever I find interesting!</p>♦

  Size Does Matter — Part 3A Philosophy of Securities Laws for Tokenized Networks♦<p>Thanks (in no particular order) to Ameen Soleimani, Peter Pan, Marc Goldich, Drew Hinkes, Olta Andoni, Marc Boiron, Lewis Cohen, Grant Gulovsen, Adrian Cortez, Jake Brukhman and the rest of the Hardcore CryptoLaw crew for feedback on the ideas in this Part 3.</p><p>What Are “Blockchain Foundations”?</p><p>As we discussed in Part 2, the Exchange Act is huge and multifaceted might apply to various tokenized open networks in multifarious and variegated ways. I cannot comprehensively speculate on all of them in one article (not even a multi-part article).</p><p>What I’d like to do is focus especially closely on something very weird and unique to the blockchain world — the integral role of “Foundations” — and then discuss how they would be affected if the Exchange Act applies to them.</p><p>A blockchain technology “Foundation” is typically (not always) an organization that:</p><ul><li>is allegedly run on a not-for-profit basis</li><li>serves as a steward of a blockchain protocol (usually with a focus on one particular network instantiating that protocol — e.g., the Ethereum mainnet in the case of the Ethereum Foundation)</li><li>is funded directly or indirectly by the sales of pre-mined network tokens to the general public or a narrower group of sophisticated investors</li><li>is staffed, or at least led at an executive level, by the developers who first launched that protocol/network</li><li>holds, and is staffed and/or led by individuals who also personally hold, a very material amount of the pre-mined network token — in the case of the Foundation, as its “treasury” and source of continued funding, and in the case of the individuals managing the Foundation, as part of their personal wealth</li><li>uses funding to directly or indirectly pay people to continue research and development for, or encourage adoption of, the protocol/network — which may be achieved through grants, investments, commercial partnerships or direct hiring</li></ul><p>It appears to me that many blockchain Foundations, such as the Ethereum Foundation, the Tezos Foundation, and the MakerDAO Foundation, fit all or most aspects of this basic pattern. Let’s call that pattern the ‘prototypical blockchain Foundation’.</p><p>Interestingly, some for-profit companies, like Block.One, also would fit the prototypical blockchain Foundation pattern, but for the fact that they choose to operate on an expressly for-profit basis rather than styling themselves as non-profit Foundations. There are also some blockchain Foundations that significantly deviate from the prototypical pattern— for example, the ZCash Foundation is not funded by ICO proceeds but by donations from the recipients of a post-network-launch founders’ reward generated gradually by the protocol. Now that the founders’ reward is over, the protocol is being updated to give the ZCash Foundation new block rewards directly. The Electric Coin Company has similar funding, but operates on a for-profit basis and may work on multiple blockchain projects rather than ZCash alone. There also are other types of for-profit companies that are highly influential on certain protocols/networks, but arose significantly after network launch and/or have a much more diversified L2 or enterprise application focus — companies like Blockstream and ConsenSys could be viewed in this light. It would also be interesting to analyze the regulatory considerations around all these slightly different types of companies and Foundations, but in the interests of time/space/attention, I am not going to deal with them here. Instead, I will focus on the prototypical blockchain Foundation.</p><p>When will a prototypical blockchain Foundation be a securities issuer? When will it be a securities issuer that is subject to reporting obligations under the Exchange Act? What are the implications of this potential reporting status, and is it good or bad for the technology? Should the reporting obligations stop at some point — at the point of “sufficient decentralization”?</p><p>Let’s talk about all these things.</p><p>A Prototypical Foundation</p><p>To avoid throwing shade on specific projects, let’s take a hypothetical Foundation with the following fact. Some of the details listed below are not directly relevant to this Part 3, but will become more relevant in Part 4 when we discuss the process of “sufficient decentralization”. Feel free to skim for now.</p><ul><li>Power Foundation raised $50M by selling network tokens (PowerCoins) for PowerChain to the public</li><li>the token sale was done based on a whitepaper which set forth the following roadmap for tech development: (a) launch as a Nakamoto-consensus PoW blockchain (b) add private transactions after launch (c) switch to a new consensus algorithm and leader-selection mechanism that enables the developers and users of DAPPs to receive block rewards→”(b)” will make PowerCoin a little more valuable but not that much more because there are many competitors with privacy solutions; by contrast, “(c)” is expected to ultimately make PowerCoin enormously more valuable because all DAPPs will want to be on PowerCoin to gain extra revenue from block rewards, fueling network effects</li><li>there was no KYC done on token buyers; Power Foundation has no idea who they are, where they live or whether they are “accredited investors,” but does suspect there are likely to be over 1,999 buyers, many of whom are in the U.S.</li><li>the Foundation used $1M of the token sale proceeds to develop a single software client embodying the protocol, the MegaZord</li></ul>♦MegaZord<ul><li>the Foundation funds a team of four full-time developers to maintain and improve MegaZord</li><li>all nodes on the Power network are powered by MegaZord</li><li>the Foundation also has a full-time marketing and finance department</li><li>the tokenomics are as follows: 100M total maximum supply (pre-mine and future mining combined); 20M supply at the time of the Token Sale (all pre-mined); 7M of pre-mine was sold in the Token Sale; 3M of pre-mine was rewarded to founders/developers who work for the Power Foundation; 10M of the pre-mine is being retained by the Foundation to fund future marketing and development</li><li>so, right after the Token Sale, the Foundation holds 50% of the current supply of the token, insiders of the Foundation hold 15% of the current supply of the token and the general public holds 50% of the current supply of the token; let’s also assume that the inflation rate from block production rewards is pretty low, like 2% / year, so these percentages may be pretty stable for a while</li><li>the Foundation has a grants group that aims to prospectively fund or retroactively reward developers who build things on top of PowerChain, integrate PowerCoin functionality into existing applications, etc.; many of these grants are paid in PowerCoins out of the Foundation’s stash, but some are also paid in ETH or BTC or USD, and some are paid in a mix of PowerCoins and other currencies</li></ul><p>To me, it is pretty simple: at its current stage, the Power Foundations is a business for developing and marketing an open blockchain network. Even if the Power Foundation is not trying to generate profits at the entity level, it is managed by people who stand to profit from the tokens and likely have a strong profit motive.</p><p>The Power Foundation is funded by the proceeds of sales of network tokens to people who hoped to profit from them and is holding onto a stash of tokens it hopes to sell in the future after they have increased in value. The proceeds of those sales are what is referred to as “risk capital” in securities law. The token holders expect to achieve profits predominantly from the efforts of the Power Foundation and the people the Power Foundation pays as they continue to develop and market the network.</p><p>In my view, these facts make the tokens both “network equity shares” for financial purposes, and securities for legal purposes and they make Power Foundation a securities issuer.</p><p>Since the Power Foundation has more than $10M in assets, then if the Power tokens are held by more than 499 unaccredited investors (which they almost certainly are), then the Power Foundation will meet the “size matters” test and be subject to Exchange Act reporting.</p><p>What would this look like? Would it be good or bad?</p><p>Imagine A World Where Foundations Were Exchange Act Reporters</p><p>Let us imagine a world in which the Power Foundation is a “reporting company” under the Exchange Act.</p><ol><li>Positive Consequences</li></ol><p>First, the positive consequences: token holders and the public would get all of the types of disclosures I listed in Part 2 of this article when I explained the purposes and effects of the Exchange Act. The Power Foundation would be the organization acting as “the securities issuer” in this circumstance. It would need to keep the public up to date regarding its financials, its sales of additional tokens, its governance and compensation arrangements, and any material conflicts of interest on the part executive officers or directors.</p><p>It’s hard for me to understand why this disclosure, in and of itself, would ever be anything but a positive thing. It’s also unlikely that an organization would ever provide this level of disclosure voluntarily, and even if it did so, the disclosure would be less trustworthy, because the SEC would not be reviewing the disclosure and discussing it with the Foundation before it is published to ensure it meets quality and credibility standards.</p><p>Not only would token holders and the public get more information about the Foundation, but the Foundation would also get more information about the market through regulations such as Section 13 of the Exchange Act. This could be very helpful, especially in the early stages of development. In the early stages, the network is very vulnerable (due to factors such as low token price (and/or hash rate, if applicable), potentially relatively high Gini coefficient, still experimental, etc.). During that early period, anything could ruin the network’s burgeoning network effect; the network must be managed with care if it wishes to reach escape velocity, and the Power Foundation will be able to manage it better if it is more informed about the marketplace.</p><p>For example, if Power Blockchain is a PoS network and someone was planning to 51% attack it by accumulating a huge stake, there would be a significant benefit to the fact that the attacker would be legally required to disclose the accumulation and plans once it reached the 5% ownership level. These disclosures would also operate as a natural regulation-based inducement to maintain and increase decentralization, since people accumulating too many tokens must either KYC themselves to the SEC and the public or be breaking the law, neither of which is very appealing.</p><p>Section 13 of the Exchange Act is essentially an out-of-protocol “silly whale penalty”: depending on your biases about how decentralization affects price, you might even consider it an added pumpamental for enhancing network equity. Sure, people can always break the law, accumulate, not disclose, and 51% attack anyway — but surely they will at least be somewhat deterred if they know the SEC may find them and retaliate.</p><p>Token holders would also have confidence that the Power Foundation’s executive officers and directors have interests aligned with theirs. Those officers and directors would be required to disclose their token holdings and their token purchases and sales; if they bought and sold tokens in a given six month period — making ‘short swing profits’ — they would be punished and required to return those profits to the Foundation for the benefit of the other token holders.</p><p>2. Negative Consequences</p><p>A. Compliance Costs</p><p>The biggest negative consequence to tokens being freely trading equity securities is that the Power Foundation will face a lot of compliance costs. “Public company compliance costs can range from $1.0 million to over $3.0 million annually even for such a relatively small company.” One has the sense that money could be “better spent” on development, marketing, etc. That, I suppose, is a values judgment, but I believe that the disclosures I outlined not only are very valuable from an investment perspective, but also would contribute to network security.</p><p>I also believe that not all of the same disclosure obligations as reporting companies face — such as the extensive financial controls obligations of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act — would be particularly important to most token investors, and that the SEC and legislators would be willing to work with token issuers to reduce disclosure obligations that impose an unreasonable cost/benefit ratio in the context of tokenized networks, even though those same obligations make more sense for traditional corporate entities.</p><p>B. Limited CryptoSecurities Exchanges</p><p>A current, but temporary, negative consequence associated with tokens being securities is the limited choice of token exchanges that are also qualified to be securities exchanges or securities ATSs. Of course, it is not exactly a choice whether a token is a security — it either is or isn’t. But since, in a way, I am advocating that tokens being a security can be a good thing, it is also incumbent upon me to note the potential negatives.</p><p>However, there are some good options — like OpenFinance, which allows trading of Ethereum-based tokens through MetaMask and has 24/7 trading hours. it should only be a matter of time until there are more venues for trading security tokens, and I would be surprised if Coinbase and Kraken do not eventually get registered as securities exchanges. Even some pure cryptocurrency exchanges are trading security tokens: for example, the non-U.S. version of Binance trades STX tokens, which are securities issued by a Blockstack in a qualified Regulation A+ offering.</p><p>Let’s also not forget the ever-exploding world of DeFi and decentralized exchanges. Uniswap is a completely autonomous, decentralized smart contract exchange which sets prices through an automated market making function, and now openly facilitates trades not only of cryptocurrencies but also security tokens. The 0x protocol is also interesting, in that it distributes functions that would ordinarily be performed by one centralized exchange operator across multiple smart contract mechanics and more limited types of market participants called relayers, and thus facilitates trust-reduced peer-to-peer trades.</p><p>I am not prepared at this point to comment on whether these decentralized solutions may escape regulation by the SEC as securities exchanges, but there is at least the possibility that they might do so — after all, there is no “intermediary” in the traditional sense, and thus many of the policy concerns underlying regulations of exchange operators arguably do not apply. Perhaps more to the point, a DEx like Uniswap is effectively unregulatable unless the SEC can somehow convince a wide cross-section of ETH client devs, node operators and miners to hardfork it away in an irregular state change — a highly unlikely scenario. In my personal opinion, this is the right way to escape regulation — by eliminating the need for intermediaries and decentralizing the power of potential censors. I see a bright future for such innovations.</p><p>C. Loss of Anonymity for Benevolent Whales</p><p>The same ability to identify ill-intentioned whales referred to above, can also be a negative — benevolent whales would be subject to the same disclosure requirements. Privacy-oriented whales would be deterred from buying as much of the token as they might otherwise be inclined to — they might try to keep their stakes below 5% of the supply, so that they never have to identify themselves in public filings. Alternatively, they might acquire large stakes and simply not disclose, thus breaking the law and opening themselves up to risk of SEC actions or lawsuits by the issuer. While discouraging evil whales is good, discouraging benevolent whales is bad — and you can’t do one without doing the other. This is a potentially material negative, particularly for a proof-of-stake network where benevolent whales may be seen as particularly critical to securing consensus.</p><p>D. Miscellaneous Negatives</p><p>There are a few other potential issues that people have occasionally raised as potential negatives of tokens constituting freely trading securities securities, but I consider them to be rather speculative, and there is fairly good evidence that, at least for the moment, the SEC does not take them seriously either. These include the following arguments, which I believe have largely been debunked:</p><ul><li>if protocol tokens are securities, then every miner must become a registered broker-dealer (debunked in Section 1 here)</li><li>if protocol tokens are securities, then miners and/or the issuer and/or “the blockchain” would need to become a registered transfer agent or clearing agency (debunked in Section 2 and Section 5 here)</li><li>if protocol tokens are securities, then websites, wallets, or other interfaces to the blockchain need to be registered securities exchanges or ATSs (debunked in Section 3 here)</li><li>a Foundation would be violating Regulation M when it sells further protocol tokens, if they are securities (debunked as to one potential fact pattern in Section 6 here)</li><li>every Foundation, by virtue of holding tokens which are securities, would need to become a registered investment company (debunked in Section 7 here)</li><li>tokens would be taxed as securities — well, they are already taxed just as punitively, if not more so; while some attorneys have argued for more beneficial kinds of taxation , there is little evidence to suggest such approaches will be adopted even if tokens are not deemed securities</li></ul><p>I very frequently hear other lawyers and various blockchain enthusiasts claim that blockchain tokens would become “unusable” if they were deemed securities. Kik and Telegram have both made such claims in the context of defending themselves against pending SEC suits. However, I have yet to hear a single example or strongly reasoned argument showing why an SEC-registered, freely trading network token would be unusable for its intended purposes merely because it is a security. If you have any examples of something I’m overlooking, by all means, contact me — I would love to hear them.</p><p>A Better Kind of Foundation?</p><p>We’ve discussed a lot about securities laws, in fairly granular and semi-technical detail. I realize it is probably a lot for non-lawyers, and that’s even with me eliding many technical nuances. I appreciate the patience and intellectual openness of anyone who has read everything so far.</p><p>To keep us grounded, before we break for Part 4 of this article, I want to pause here for a moment and get back to the problems I pointed out at the start of Part 1 of this article. Let’s do a bit of score-keeping and think about how securities laws could possibly help with them.</p><blockquote>founders don’t want their token to be a security, so they can’t or won’t talk about, worry about, or work on token price</blockquote><p>In a world where tokens are simply accepted as being securities, this would no longer be an issue. Then, an amazing thing could happen — protocol devs could actively and openly work to drive value to the token, without hiding their intentions. We all know influential devs like Vitalik want to create value for their network token of choice, and all holders of that token want and expect them to do so.</p><p>Moreover, with the planned transition to PoS, we can no longer pretend that issues of token value are incidental or trivial, since the security of the network directly depends on token value. So why are we playing these ridiculous games of make-believe that no one cares about and that leading devs are not in a position to positively impact valuation? It is simply not true.</p><p>What we arguably gain from such games is that a token is not classified as a security and $1–2M of compliance costs per year are saved.</p><p>What we lose from such games is disclosure, market momentum, and the ability and willingness of technical leaders like Vitalik Buterin to respond to basic questions about token value and market dynamics. Imagine if a CEO like Sundar Pichai or Elon Musk got on an investor call and refused to answer basic questions about price and finances and projections and market momentum? It’s no less absurd for Vitalik Buterin and other blockchain technology leaders to refuse such questions when token holders ask.</p><p>Here are the kinds of things Elon Musk says on investor calls: “Musk confidently told investors on the call that autonomous driving will transform Tesla into a company with a $500 billion market cap [and] existing Teslas will increase in value as self-driving capabilities are added via software, and will be worth up to $250,000 within three years.”</p><p>Shouldn’t we want blockchain founders to be able to talk to us the same way? They could, if only they weren’t trying to preposterously pretend their tokens are not securities.</p><blockquote>the tech isn’t getting built as fast and well as it could be because everyone is engaging in “decentralization theater” to keep the regulators off their backs; instead of investments, project management and carefully negotiated joint ventures, we have “grants” and “rough social consensus”</blockquote><p>In order to make software development look decentralized and thus (try to) avoid being subject to securities laws, Foundations don’t hire people and direct and manage their efforts — instead, they give “grants” to “independent teams” and then claim not to know exactly what those teams are doing.</p><p>This can be fine, and in fact is desirable, when a network is relatively mature and only needs maintenance and incremental improvements. However. when a network is waiting for a massive upgrade like the change from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0, this type of approach is counterproductive and potentially disastrous. This is no way to launch what is essentially a new network run on a new protocol.</p><p>Instead, new technologies should be launched start-up style — under the benevolent dictatorship of a founding genius (or at most a few founding geniuses). Why are we building 10 clients that all do the same thing with 10 separate teams engaged in overlapping efforts? Though having multiple clients could lead to a more decentralized network, and that is good, there is no independent, long-term funding plan for any of them — and thus no particular reason to expect that almost all of them won’t go the way of the Parity Client when their devs run out of grant money or just lose interest. This is not an efficient use of capital or time.</p><p>By contrast, if we embraced an initial period of relative centralization and coverage under the securities laws, these technology projects could be managed efficiently and aggressively to yield much better results for token holders, DAPP developers and users.</p><p>NOTE (post-publication update): For a counterpoint to this perspective, please read Ben Edington’s article here.</p><p>While he admits that Ethereum 2.0 project development takes the “bazaar” model farther than is typical even by open source standards (“we’ve taken it further. We’re applying this approach to the development of the Eth2 protocol itself, its very design and the R&amp;D behind it…”) and confesses candidly that “failing to have answers on issues like [an exact date when Ethereum 2.0 will go live, a 2-year committed road map, and how cross-shard transactions will preserve DeFi composability] would have gotten me fired from my old, corporate job,” he nevertheless argues that this chaotic development process is “the magic of Ethereum’s development approach…Ethereum’s superpower.” I disagree. There is a difference between chaos and openness. But I felt his that his views were worth including here.</p><blockquote>token HODLers have been punished by one of the worst bubble pops in human history, they feel like their investments turned founders into celebrity millionaires and the investors were left behind</blockquote><p>Bubbles occur in regulated and unregulated markets, so it’s a bit hard to call this one. I do suspect that much of the current depression in token markets is due to regulatory uncertainty. To the extent regulation were actually embraced — perhaps recognizing that, while it comes with some costs, it also comes with benefits — that uncertainty would be reduced, and perhaps that set the stage for a market rebound. Of course, markets are complicated, and part of the intent of the regulations is to prevent speculative bubbles by smoothing out information asymmetries. Ideally, a regulated market might grow more slowly, but also more steadily and sanely; however, of course, even with regulations, there are no guarantees.</p><blockquote>new money is sitting on the sidelines, deterred by the first three points and a host of Peter-Schiff- and Nouriel-Roubini-style shade thrown at blockchain, duly amplified by the normies in mass media</blockquote><p>It is certainly possible that institutional investors and other sources of fresh capital could be enticed into funding tokenized network development by a more regulated market. This would be particularly true if, unlike with the ICOs of the past, Foundations gave tokenholders rights to enforce good Foundation governance— such as the right to vote on election of directors. In the past, granting such rights was likely avoided in part because developers feared that if they gave tokenholders rights, the tokens would be deemed to be securities. Once regulation is accepted as normal, this concern would no longer apply.</p><blockquote>regulators are 2–3 years behind the tech curve, are easily duped, are confused, and are terrified of losing cases, so they only go after the easy targets that don’t require rethinking the laws</blockquote><p>In my opinion, while some no action letters were obtained from the SEC this year stating that certain tokens are not securities, they did not really advance the dialogue — they were no-brainers as a matter of law, and the tokens present no realistic possibility of generating upside for tokenholders or fueling enthusiasm for a new open network. This is not the path to progress.</p><p>To me, it would make much more sense to do what Blockstack did with its Regulation A+ offering — embrace regulation, but work closely with the SEC to get flexibility where it counts. For example, the SEC appeared willing to accept Blockstack’s arguments that STX might be debt securities rather than equity securities (though I personally think those arguments are wrong), and that Blockstack and miners on the Blockstack network did not need to register as broker-dealers. By accepting regulation as a threshold matter, one opens the door to modifying regulations as they are applied to open network technology, so that the law complements rather than inhibits the technology.</p><blockquote>legislators are primarily influenced by D.C. insider lobbyists, who in turn are funded by corporate-style blockchain projects, and are proposing truly terribly drafted and ill-considered laws</blockquote><p>I will address this in part 4 when I discuss “sufficient decentralization.” Suffice it to say, I do not think that just because a database is a “blockchain” it should be subject to less regulation. A blockchain is just a data structure. By contrast, I do think open networks that essentially serve as ownerless, decentralized public infrastructure deserve special privileges and exemptions under the law. The lobbyists and legislators working on these issues are easily swayed by enterprise-style blockchain projects or projects more concerned with evading the consequences of their past mistakes than being good stewards of the law; they often do not recognize what makes decentralized networks special, and therefore do not know how to properly draft these types of laws.</p><blockquote>millions of dollars are getting poured into securities law defense suits and “defense funds” instead of invested in tech development that could one day make the laws irrelevant</blockquote><p>Obvious. Fewer securities law violations, fewer lawsuits, less waste.</p><blockquote>our tech is “don’t trust, verify” but our governance is “just trust us,” with black-box “Foundations” making pretty much all major decisions for tokenized blockchain networks; they justify whatever they do based on meaninglessly vague concepts like “social contract”</blockquote><p>This gets into deeper issues of governance, and does not depend solely on securities laws. Maybe I’ll save this for a Part 5 — or another article entirely. For now, it’s enough to consider that if tokenholders have good disclosure, they’ll have a greater chance of monitoring and providing feedback to Foundations, and they will be able to hold Foundations accountable for malfeasance.</p><blockquote>the tech is creating new monsters every day; cryptocurrency exchanges are turning into investment banks that just hold your crypto and pay you interest; meanwhile, many DeFi projects are just a slightly de-risked variation on the same trend</blockquote><p>I frankly don’t think securities laws will do much to reverse this; they might even make it worse. However, at least there would be greater accountability for such actors — many of them would have to become registered securities intermediaries.</p><blockquote>the crypto whales of 2015–2017 are our new tech VC gods who need to get paid their vig before they’ll let you access the broader capital markets</blockquote><p>Again, not a whole can be done here — wealth tends to concentrate. However, a more regulated market for open network tokens could bring in larger amounts of retail money (legally) as well as other types of large investors like investment banks and pension funds. To the extent you might think stakeholder diversity is positive, this could be beneficial to the health and governance of the network.</p><blockquote>every lawyer whose career needs a boost is now a “crypto lawyer” and they’re making bank even as the tech and culture languish into utter inanity</blockquote><p>Well, this would continue to be the case. Except maybe it’d be less litigation, and more advanced deal structuring. Over time, advanced deal structuring scales and becomes cheaper — SEC filings are public, and anyone can leverage them. By contrast, litigation facts are obscure, fact-specific, and don’t tend to help make life for new projects easier. You end up paying more in the long run when you took shortcuts early on.</p><blockquote>the buzziest project launch of 2019 is fucking Libra by Facebook!!!!</blockquote><p>Maybe with a more regulated market, more projects could get funding — and they’d be better, more inventive, more worthwhile for humanity?</p><p>In Part 4, we’re going to get to the good stuff — when do securities laws cease to apply? When is the point of “sufficient decentralization” reached?</p><p>There is no binding legal precedent on this yet. However, I fully expect that — provided we can avoid passing garbled legislation that makes things even more confusing — clear guidelines could be defined.</p><p>In Part 4, I will propose my own version of a test for when “sufficient decentralization” has been achieved and open network tokens should stop being securities. I can’t guarantee that test will be adopted or even considered by the powers that be, but perhaps it will add some momentum to the discussions and help provide some clarity.</p>♦♦<p>Size Does Matter — Part 3 was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Size Does Matter — Part 2A Philosophy of Securities Laws for Tokenized Networks♦<p>Tokenized Network Equity Implicates the Securities Laws</p><p>I’m going to be blunt: in its early stages the tokens on pretty much every tokenized network meet one or more tests for being securities and, more to the point, implicate just about every policy concern underlying the securities laws.</p><p>Phew. Glad we got that out of the way. = )</p><p>I feel like I probably don’t have to belabor or justify this point too much, since there are already so many SEC reports, SEC settlements, court opinions and mountains of legal scholarship and cryptolegal scholarship and cryptotwitter commentary on the issue — you can just go read that shit.</p><p>What I want to do here is go like maybe one to three layers deeper on this than usual.</p><p>Pretty much all of the securities law commentary on tokens out there refers primarily or exclusively to issues under the Securities Act of 1933. This is the U.S. law that enshrines the fundamental tenet of securities regulation: that all securities offers/sales must be either registered with the SEC or formally exempt from SEC registration. This law is what mainly defines when a set of founders or a company can sell you some new tokens/securities. But….</p><p>…did you know…</p><p>….there are actually….</p><p>…more securities laws? Yes, :</p>♦<p>Here are the ones I most want to talk about:</p><ul><li>the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which regulates secondary securities markets generally (the “Exchange Act”)</li><li>Section 12 of the Exchange Act, which determines when issuers must become public reporters and what they must report (“Exchange-Act-reporting companies”)</li><li>The Williams Act, which amends the Exchange Act to add Section 13, which requires large holders (or groups of holders) of the equity securities of a reporting issuer to publicly identify themselves and confess their takeover plans, and regulates the manner by which they can acquire controlling positions in an issuer from the open market</li><li>Section 14 of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of votes (sometimes called “proxies”) on matters pertaining to the governance of a securities issuer</li><li>Section 16 of the Exchange Act, which regulates purchases and sales of equity securities by large (10%+) holders and directors/executive officers of an issuer</li></ul><p>Once you view open network tokens as being shares of network equity, I think it becomes pretty obvious that they implicate many if not all of the same policy concerns as are addressed for conventional “equity securities” under the Exchange Act. This is the first point I want to make to you here, and I will elaborate upon it in the rest of this article.</p><p>The second, potentially even more controversial point I want to make is that, up to a certain juncture (the juncture of “sufficient decentralization”), applying those regulations (albeit perhaps in slightly modified form so that they work with crypto) is a good thing that everyone should want to get behind.</p><p>Indeed, I believe that by adapting some of the tests and criteria that are to be found in the Exchange Act, one can cut through the morass of lameness I listed off in bullet points in Part 1 of this article AND help the SEC and legislators much more precisely define the much maligned/sought after point of “sufficient decentralization” where a share of network equity ceases to be (or should cease to be) regulated as a security. I’ll elaborate on that as well.</p><p>But I am getting ahead of myself. Let me slow down &amp; explain a bit more.</p><p>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About the Exchange Act But Were Afraid to Ask</p><p>I am taking the inspiration for the title of this section from a long-running panel which occurs every year at the end of the Securities Regulation Institute event in Coronado, California entitled: “Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Securities Laws But Were Afraid to Ask.” Yes, that one has a broader title, but it is done by a panel of excellent lawyers who probably were a lot smarter than me even before they gained like 20+ years of securities law experience a piece, many from within the SEC.</p><p>Me? I’m just going to cover the Exchange Act, and I’m not even going to cover all of that, and even the parts that I cover will probably be covered pretty lazily.</p><p>Okay, with caveats out of the way, let’s begin:</p><ol><li>The Exchange Act Embodies a Principle of “Size Matters”</li></ol><p>The most crypto-relevant thing to know about the Exchange Act is that most of its provisions apply on a basic “size matters” principle. Section 12 requires issuers to become “reporting companies” if either their securities trade on a “national securities exchange” (like NASDAQ or NYSE) OR they have more than $10M in assets as well as more than 1,999 equityholders of record or more than 499 equityholders of record who are not accredited investors.</p><p>A “reporting company” is what you probably think of as a “public company”: it is subject to extensive regulations and publishes comprehensive quarterly, annual and periodic public reports with the SEC. The costs of complying with the public reporting and related auditing, accounting and governance requirements imposed on a “reporting company” typically tally in the millions of dollars per year. Thus, it only makes sense to impose such regulations on issuers of sufficient operational and/or market scale.</p><p>Because “size matters,” it absolutely is possible to become a “reporting company” by accident. That is why even most “tech unicorns” with valuations in the billions of dollars usually tightly control secondary trading in their stock; otherwise, the stock could be acquired by too many people and the issuer could be forced to prematurely incur the burdens of a “reporting company” while still in private scaling mode.</p><p>Notably, most ICO issuers who have struck settlements with the SEC have been ordered to register as “reporting companies” under Section 12(g) the Exchange Act — this is because their tokens are presumed to be held by more than 499 unaccredited investors and they are presumed to have $10M+ in assets, thus triggering reporting company requirements. Implicitly, this also means that the SEC views such tokens not just as securities but as equity securities. You will get the gist from this article that I think their view in that regard is not without merit.</p><p>2. The Exchange Act Is Primarily About Imposing Good Disclosure Practices on Critical Market Players Who May Have Structural Conflicts of Interest</p><p>I know, I know — everyone in crypto hates proscriptive rules. We are rebels. The “accredited investor rule”, when considered in isolation, is deservedly maligned — it feels like it’s just about who can buy securities at low prices, and who has to buy them at more expensive prices. It feels like an outgrowth of the nanny state.</p><p>That’s the ’33 Act. You may not like it. That’s fine. I could justify (and have justified) it as potentially being more about protecting markets than individuals, despite that it’s often framed as “protecting investors.” But we all know it’s overly complex, focuses on the wrong things, and could stand to be both greatly simplified and liberalized. Let’s save that debate for another day. Because right now we’re not talking about the ’33 Act. We’re talking about the Exchange Act, baby. And that’s a whole different world.</p><p>The Exchange Act is all about securities markets. It applies mainly public companies and freely trading securities, and leaves all that permissioning hogwash to the ’33 Act. Cryptoeconomics people should love the Exchange Act — they might view it as old-fashioned and insufficiently voluntarist, but they at least should find it interesting in a “game recognize game” kind of way.</p><p>From the standpoint of securities issuers and securities holders, really this law is all about letting people do pretty much whatever they want as long as they make the right public disclosures, and the disclosures are designed to tease out potential bad behavior by people who have structural conflicts of interest and could potentially abuse them for their personal gain.</p><p>Issuers who get so big that they become integral to the capital markets have to publish regular reports about their financial status, plans, critical personnel and potential liabilities — they do this not just “voluntarily” but by law, under the close supervision of the SEC, because everyone knows you can’t trust people to confess the sins or structural weaknesses or potential conflicts of interest they’re most ashamed of, but which may be most relevant and impactful to the marketplace. You need not just voluntary disclosure, but legally required, supervised disclosure, to ensure that information asymmetries are eliminated and markets can truly be “free.”</p><p>Does this sound familiar? Yes, it’s basically “don’t trust, verify” on the legal/social layer. IOW, the Exchange Act is cypherpunk af.</p><p>It’s worth noting in passing the other side of the Exchange Act — which we’re not going to talk a ton about here — is about regulating securities intermediaries. In the normie finance world these are your stock exchanges, securities brokers, securities dealers, proxy solicitors, etc. In the crypto world these would be your Coinbases and Binances, your market makers and OTC traders, your crypto banks and all-too-human crypto trading whales. While these players are very needed for cryptocurrencies, they are also the single biggest trust hole and source of abuse in the industry. I take it as a given that true cypherpunks really don’t mind if they are regulated. I think they should be heavily regulated and that regulators have mostly been asleep at the switch with them. What most people are worried about is that the regulations will adversely affect the tech itself — that is what we’re going to keep our focus on.</p><p>3. The Exchange Act Makes Issuers Be Transparent</p><p>A securities issuer that meets the “size matters” test has to file the following reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act:</p><ul><li>annual / quarterly reports (Form 10-Ks and 10-Qs)</li><li>annual shareholders’ reports (Schedule 14As)</li><li>current reports (Form 8-Ks)</li></ul><p>Taken together, these reports keep shareholders thoroughly informed about the issuer, by the issuer, under conditions designed to ensure that the disclosures will be accurate and not misleading.</p><p>Information is power, and so having this information, when combined with their ability to freely sell their shares (and, oftentimes, the right to elect directors — more on that later), enables shareholders to keep the issuers — and their current management teams — accountable for the results of their decisions. This happens on a market-wide basis, and insiders are prohibited from taking advantage of information asymmetries. The basic motto is: there should be an even playing field for everyone, and sunlight is the best disinfectant.</p><p>Among the disclosures that are included in these reports are:</p><ul><li>comprehensive overviews of the issuer’s business and financial condition, including disclosures about past and expected future performance, future plans, liabilities and risks</li><li>GAAP-compliant, independently audited financial statements</li><li>the names and roles of the issuer’s most important decision-makers, how much stock of the issuer each such person holds and on what terms each such person holds it (e.g., subject to time-based vesting, performance-based vesting, etc.)</li><li>the compensation practices of the issuer, especially as applied to directors and officers</li><li>related party transactions between the issuer and its directors, officers or large stockholders — for example, the issuer hiring the CEO’s other company to perform an important job</li><li>reports about material current events regarding the issuer, which must be published within 4 business days of the event, including e.g.: mergers, acquisitions and dispositions of material assets/entities/businesses, departures or firings of executive management, material lawsuits, material commercial agreements with third parties, bankruptcy of the issuer, expected delisting of securities of the issuer from a major exchange, unregistered sales (private placements) of the issuer’s securities, material modifications to the rights of the issuer’s current securities holders, new bonuses or other compensation to directors or executive officers, material changes to the issuer’s governance structure, etc.</li></ul><p>These rules are highly desirable. Investors in a company or project need to know about their revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and plans in order evaluate the prospects of the investment. There are also major conflicts of interest that arise when managers have great influence over a large project with extensive assets — the insiders can wield their influence to get paid too much, or get paid in ways that cause their incentives to diverge from those of the securities holders — and thus investors have a right to know about compensation arrangements and “related party transactions” with executive officers and/or their affiliates. If a company’s securities are about to get delisted from a major exchange or the company is about to go bankrupt or get acquired, the securities holders have a right to know about that as soon as possible — and they should know about it all at once, before any insiders or other major market participants can trade on the information ahead of them.</p><p>4. The Exchange Act Requires Insiders to Disclose Their Trades and Return Ill-Gotten Gains to Shareholders</p><p>Probably the best thing here is just to quoth the SEC’s website:</p><blockquote>Section 16 of the Exchange Act applies to an SEC reporting company’s directors and officers, as well as shareholders who own more than 10% of a class of the company’s equity securities registered under the Exchange Act. The rules under Section 16 require these “insiders” to report most of their transactions involving the company’s equity securities to the SEC within two business days on Forms 3, 4 or 5.</blockquote><blockquote>Section 16 also establishes mechanisms for a company to recover “short swing” profits, or profits an insider realizes from a purchase and sale of the company’s security that occur within a six-month period.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Section 16 prohibits short selling by insiders of any class of the company’s securities, whether or not that class is registered under the Exchange Act.</blockquote><p>I’m not sure I need to belabor too much why these rules are desirable; they seem pretty self-explanatory. If you are an investor in a project or a company, you don’t want the people running that project/company, or its biggest whale investors (who likely have extra information), to be able make all kinds of profitable trades from their insider information while you, a hapless pleb with a smaller stake, no control, and less information, just HODL. Also, even when insiders are selling in the ordinary course (rather than flipping for short-swing profits), you want to know about that too, as it may imply an increase or loss of confidence in the investment prospects of the projects by the people best positioned to judge it.</p><p>5. The Exchange Act (Via the Williams Act) Prevents 51% Attacks by Creeps</p><p>The Williams Act does a bunch of things, but was mostly passed to counter the practice of “greenmail” by “corporate raiders” like Carl Icahn back when M&amp;A was still kind of a punk rock thing. It amends the Exchange Act to create Section 13 and impose reporting obligations on major investors who might be in a position to manipulate the market for an issuer’s securities in a manner intended to facilitate a “creeping acquisition” of a majority of the issuer’s securities at artificially low prices.</p><p>In other words, the Exchange Act (via the Williams Act) imposes disclosure obligations that limit the ability of well-endowed creeps to manipulate an issuer and/or its securities through secondary market trading. It is sort of a supplement to Section 16. Whereas Section 16 is primarily intended to regulate the activity of potentially conflicted and powerful “insiders”, Section 13/the Williams Act is primarily intended to regulate outsiders who are “un-conflicted” in a bad way — because they’re all about themselves.</p><p>The core disclosure obligation under Section 13 is, again, best summarized by the SEC:</p><blockquote>If your company has registered a class of its equity securities under the Exchange Act, shareholders who acquire more than 5% of the outstanding shares of that class must file beneficial owner reports on Schedule 13D or 13G until their holdings drop below 5%. These filings contain background information about the shareholders who file them as well as their investment intentions, providing investors and the company with information about accumulations of securities that may potentially change or influence company management and policies.</blockquote><p>While perhaps the reasons why these rules are good may be less obvious, they are good and the reasons why bear some reflecting on. For our purposes, you can think of Section 13 as the first anti-51%-attacker rule in the realm of traditional corporate finance. Consider:</p><ul><li>the governance of most public companies on the most critical issues (like authorizing more stock, participating as a constituent company in a merger, dissolving, etc.) comes down to a vote of the majority of issued and outstanding shares of common stock of that company — i.e., public companies are majority-governed</li><li>because these companies are majority-governed, having 51% of the shares is not just 1% more valuable than having 50% of the shares — it’s many many multiples more valuable — that multiple is what is referred to in traditional corporate finance as a “control premium”, and actually you could argue this is more of a sliding scale as well, since large but sub-controlling stakes confer control-like advantages that should also command a premium</li><li>so if someone were to try to buy 51% of a company in a transparent, arms-length process, they should expect to pay a control premium</li><li>thus, it is much better for them if they can secretly buy 51% of a company at the base market rate — i.e., without the control premium — before anyone ever knows it</li><li>thus, there should be regulations that prevent, or at least very strongly discourage, these unfair events from happening</li></ul><p>So yeah, these rules are good and just make sense. Before they were passed, “corporate raiders” like T. Boone Pickens were fleecing public shareholders left and right by acquiring huge amounts of shares secretly and then seeking to leverage their controlling (or very large and, for all practical purposes, controlling) stakes to extract value from both the shareholders and the issuer to line their own pockets. After they were passed, all those guys had to change jobs and become “shareholder activists,” which is a slightly less blatant form of ripping off shareholders, and (as much as the former BigLaw lawyer in me hates to admit) may even overall be a net socially positive thing for most shareholders of most companies, most of the time.</p>♦actual corporate raider, caught in the wild<p>I suppose you can see where I’m going with this. Turns out, corporations with publicly trading equity securities are not too different from public tokenized networks after all. Both can be 51% attacked. The potential analogy is particularly strong when one thinks about PoS networks; stronger still when one thinks about DPoS networks with a voting component, like Tezos. And just like with blockchains, corporations typically should not and do not rely solely upon the law to protect themselves — they also can rely on, essentially, cryptoeconomic algorithms like a “poison pill” plan — an interesting topic for a future article!</p><p>In the meantime, all of this surely has to make us wonder; Is it possible that securities regulations, and not just cryptoeconomics alone, may have some reasonable role to play in guarding against 51% attacks and similar attacks against blockchain networks? We shall see…</p><p>6. The Exchange Act Regulates Issuers’ Governance and the Process of Soliciting Votes As Part of the Governance Process</p><p>Section 14 of the Exchange Act requires that issuers or other persons soliciting a vote from shareholders provide a “proxy statement” giving shareholders all the relevant information so that the vote is informed. A lot of that information pertains to who manages the company, which voting securities in the company they hold, what their conflicts of interest may be, and similar things.</p><p>This is very useful. For example, before a shareholder votes in favor of electing a new director of a corporation, the shareholder would probably like to know if the director holds a lot of stock of the corporation, or of a competing corporation, or of another corporation that is hoping to land a lucrative commercial deal with this one. The shareholder would like to understand what the director’s expertise, competence and history are in managing a corporation. The shareholder would like to and deserves to know whether the director’s incentives are aligned with the shareholder’s.</p><p>There are all sorts of situations in the blockchain world where a requirement like this may be warranted. For example, if leadership from the MakerDAO Foundation is soliciting approval by MKR holders of a new type of token to serve as CDP collateral — shouldn’t MKR holders get a regulated disclosure about which MakerDAO leaders may hold material amounts of that token and stand to gain economically if it is approved?</p><p>One interesting facet of the proxy rules that would be interesting to think through in this context is the “unbundling rule”. The policy goal behind the rule is to ensure maximal shareholder freedom by enabling them to vote a la carte on proposals, rather than potentially having to approve some they dislike in order to approve the other proposals that they do like. An example would be a proposed merger-of-equals between a Japanese and U.S. company that creates a new parent company in the Netherlands and thus changes stockholders’ voting rights because Dutch corporate law now applies: the SEC may require that the changes to the voting rights be voted on separately from the merger itself.</p><p>One can see how some kind of unbundling rule rule could apply to solicitations of token-voters in a system like Tezos’s to require that each material proposal be separately voted on, rather than requiring voting on a “package deal”. For example, if the protocol upgrade both introduces anonymity features and changes the inflation schedule — why should token holders need to approve the inflation schedule if they just want the anonymity features?</p><p>If the policy goal underlying the rule were broadened further (which likely would require changes in law), one could imagine this being applied to the node update process in hardforks even for non-coin-voting networks — instead of devs releasing a “package deal” hardfork update to the major clients, they could be required or incentivized to break them up into single proposals so that a given node operator has a choice of which changes to signal support for.</p><p>Of course, on the negative side, such an approach could also have significant drawbacks in terms of logistics and coordination, as well as predictability of the upgrade path.</p><p>In any event, the point is this: there are reasons why such disclosure-based protections would be useful in crypto, and they are almost totally absent from the blockchain world today. Yet getting rid of such protections in the traditional corporate world would be close to unthinkable. It’s not that blockchain dev geniuses have figured some brilliant DAO-based method of coding conflicts of interest out of the world; it’s just that no one is holding them accountable the way traditional companies are held accountable in the normie corporate finance world. But someone should be holding them accountable, and the natural group to do so is the tokenholders, miners and other major network participants, who will need to receive good thorough disclosures in order to do so.</p><p>So, now you know all about the Exchange Act and why it’s actually cool. In Part 3 of the Article, we’re going to talk about what it looks like to apply the Exchange Act to network equity tokens.</p>♦♦<p>Size Does Matter — Part 2 was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Size Does Matter — Part 1A Philosophy of Securities Laws for Tokenized Networks♦<p>Introduction</p><p>I am a U.S. corporate/securities lawyer who has spent (wasted?) much of the last three years contemplating how securities laws apply to tokenized blockchain networks.

Well, not just the laws — but the people who try to enforce them, try to advise about them, try to comply with them and/or try to avoid them or don’t mind breaking them. Because I think there has been a shocking lack of understanding and imagination by all those players— I, too, am guilty and have played my part in this. But now I am trying to blaze a new path.</p><p>Securities attorneys, securities regulators and blockchain enthusiasts all disagree with each other and one another about securities laws. I am not going to be able to resolve all those debates today, and I am not even going to try.</p><p>What I can do (at least I think) is provide a framework of sorts — if you’ll indulge me, a philosophy — of how I think securities laws should (and possibly already do) apply to tokenized open networks and how this might help fix the problems I mentioned above and bring back the dankness to crypto.</p><p>I do not expect everyone to agree with me. You probably won’t agree with me. If you’re a lawyer, you’ll definitely disagree with me because, as a very legally savvy Ethereum dev once aptly said to me, “You lawyers all secretly hate each other.” (And it’s true!)</p><p>But I think even those who disagree can appreciate having a coherent set of interlinked concepts and arguments at which to aim their rebuttals. Maybe they will even appreciate how securities laws could end up being a positive force for enhancing the most deeply rooted cypherpunk values of the industry.</p><p>In explaining this philosophy, I do not plan to cite much to securities case law or scholarship. Filling in that detail would certainly be useful — and perhaps I or others will do it in future work — but it would also be boring. And there are only so many hours in a day. My arguments will also range from syllogisms to Socratic dialogues to intuition pumps and reductio ad absurdums. They won’t be very technical.</p><p>But if this were scholarship, I’d publish it in a journal, get it peer-reviewed and probably be invited to talk on more panels. This is not scholarship; it’s more like my personal cryptolaw manifesto. I’m a lawyer, but I’m also an outsider — this article may best be appreciated by other outsiders and less so by people who already have achieved a lot of wealth and power in the industry. So be it.</p><p>Open Network Tokens Are Shares of Network Equity</p><p>Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari once defined philosophy as “the art of forming, inventing, and fabricating concepts.” So, too, my philosophy of the securities laws for tokenized networks begins with one special concept: the concept of network equity.</p><p>Network equity should be familiar — it is already how you think about the value of most of your tokens. It is essentially the notion of network value Joel Monegro meant to describe with his “fat protocol” flywheel:</p>♦Joel Monegro’s Fat Protocol Flywheel<p>I define a “network equity token” as a token that (in theory or practice) tends to capture all or a portion of the value of an open network. This should not be too controversial, but, sadly, it is.</p><p>You see, I believe that when we use terminology like “ICO,” “dilution,” “stakeholders,” “market cap” and “fork” (which are reminiscent of IPOs, equity dilution, stockholders, market capitalization and stock splits for corporate capital stock), it is not accidental. Contrary to the commentary by some mavens (including myself in a past life), the use of such terms is not just the result of some colossally unfortunate misunderstanding of network tokens, traditional securities, or both. Rather, we are using these words deliberately, and in a way that makes sense, because they are the words that come closest to capturing our intuitions about what network value is (a kind of quasi-equity) and how open network tokens capture it (like shares).</p><p>The ICO mania of 2016–2017 was fueled by people who believed that by buying a protocol token they were buying a “stake” in an open network which would increase in value as the network became more popular. The nature of the captured value is not exactly the same as the nature of corporate shareholders’ equity (it is not a claim on the positive difference between assets and liabilities belonging to an entity), and how a token captures that value is not the same as how a share of stock captures the value of shareholder’s equity (the former being functionalistic and the latter rights-based). Nevertheless, a network token is the closest one can come to acquiring equity in a network that is not owned by anyone, and being a tokenholder in that network is as close as one can come to being a stockholder in an owner-less enterprise for the management of that network. “Equity” also has a broader meaning than “shareholders’ equity,” as reflected in concepts like “home equity” and “brand equity”. Hence, I consider “network equity” to be appropriate both in name and concept to cover the value represented by open network tokens.</p><p>The motive for this article is basically as follows: I believe the regulatory questions around open network tokens become far clearer when such tokens are openly viewed as shares of network equity and when their nature as securities is embraced (until the point of “sufficient decentralization”). This is better than viewing such tokens merely as “digital money” or “utility tokens”; those concepts are a very poor fit for how tokens are actually used, valued and thought of, and have mainly been adopted in a half-baked attempt to dodge securities laws.</p><p>Indeed, the “network equity” frame aligns far more closely with the actual intuitions, motives and beliefs of network participants as they are found in the wild. Token network developers can be seen to allocate network tokens to early employees like they are “founders’ shares” in a hot startup, often even to the point of subjecting them to vesting. Large early token buyers conduct due diligence and seek to establish reputations just like Silicon Valley venture capital funds. Retail token buyers who buy in later and have less information tend to piggyback off of the credentials, prestige and prior valuations achieved by the founding team and early investors. All this feels a whole lot like what happens in the normie corporate equity market. Sure, there are some differences — and ultimately some of those differences should be reflected in amendments to the applicable laws — but there are far more similarities than differences.</p><p>At this point, I have made some bold assertions. I suspect that at this stage of the article many readers will still be skeptical about the merits of those assertions. You may still question whether “network equity shares” is a good way to view open network tokens. You may be thinking “aren’t tokens a lot more like products than shares? or aren’t they kind of like commodities or something?”</p><p>Therefore, I will devote the next section to addressing potential skepticism — by debunking every other common analogy for tokens to traditional instruments in the traditional commercial/corporate world.</p><p>Why Other Conceptions of Open Network Tokens Are Weak Sauce</p><ol><li>Open Network Tokens Are Not Much Like Debt</li></ol><p>Debt is an obligation of the borrower to pay, and the lender to receive, a principal amount plus interest, potentially as modified by some extrinsic factors like fluctuations in the currency in which principal and interest are denominated. Debt can be secured (the creditor has the right to foreclose on specific collateral to ensure repayment) or unsecured (no collateral).</p><p>Needless to say, open network tokens are nothing like debt:</p><p>First of all, they do not represent a right to reclaim funds. However, I consider this difference relatively unimportant. Network tokens also do not represent a right to claim the difference between assets and liabilities. Thus, if I were limited to this reasoning, network tokens would be nothing like debt and nothing like equity; my entire philosophy would be dead in the water.</p><p>The much more important reason why open network tokens are nothing like debt is, secondly, that the returns and risks one expects from such a token are totally unlike the returns and risks a creditor expects from a loan. One never expects a blowout return or catastrophic loss from debt: they are inherently conservative investments designed to yield modest returns with significant downside protections (particularly in the collateral-backed variety). However, the primary goal of equity investment is a blowout return, and the price one pays for the possibility of gaining that return is bearing the risk that very few such investments generate any material return at all; in fact, many can and will result in total or close to total loss. Thus, the profit and risk profile of open network tokens is far more like that of equity, and in any event is very, very little like that of debt.</p><p>2. Open Network Tokens Are Not Much Like Consumable “Products”</p><p>An oft-repeated concept for open network tokens paints them as “products,” or sometimes more specifically “software products”. This analogy is a little better than debt, but still highly inaccurate and misleading in the vast majority of circumstances.</p><p>First of all, the “products” covered by securities law precedents are about as little like open network tokens as imaginable. I have had many an occasion to hear securities lawyers whose opinions I otherwise respect to compare tokens like ETH to the oranges in the Howey case, the whiskey in the Glen Arden case or the rare coins in the Brigadoon Scotch Distributors case. One of two things is always true of these lawyers:</p><p>(1) they’re acting as persuasive advocates and thus not being completely candid; or</p><p>(2) they don’t really use crypto, are not in crypto communities and therefore have not yet made frenemies with the mingled sense of dread and taboo pleasure to be found in buying an unreasonably large quantity of a properly pumpamentalized open network token, brimming with fevered dreams of sick gainz at 3 o’clock in the morning.</p><p>An open network token, by itself, is useless. You can’t drink it like whiskey. You can’t eat it like an orange. You can’t hold it up to the light and admire the deft, antique craftsmanship of the embossed design or the nuanced sense of history imparted by its slightly worn and scored patina.</p><p>A network token is none of these things: Rather, it is a unit of account that belongs to you by virtue of the fact that it is recognized as being governed by a particular public/private key pairing on a database maintained by a network of nodes operated by numerous people, in accordance with rules established in a piece of software that was designed by numerous other people to recognize and govern changes of such units of account under such conditions and in accordance with such cryptographic rules.</p><p>If everyone stopped running those nodes, the token would be useless and valueless to the point of arguably being nonexistent. If the software client didn’t work right or stopped being updated or at least maintained, the token would be substantially or completely devalued. The token can never truly be used or even enjoyed in the absence of these network-based dependencies.</p><p>Let’s compare that to some other things that securities lawyers would have you believe are similar to tokens and should be regulated the same:</p><ul><li>a bottle of whiskey can get you drunk long after the whiskey distiller has folded up shop</li><li>an orange can be eaten without giving a damn which grove it came from or whether that grove is still around</li><li>a collectible metal coin can be aesthetically enjoyed, or melted down to reclaim the value of the metals in its alloy, even if the government that minted it has long fallen waste to the annals of history</li></ul><p>Whiskey, oranges and collectible metal coins are products because they have a life independent from the circumstances of their production. Open network tokens do not…they are only useful in the context of a particular network and the continued willingness of people to operate that.</p><p>3. Open Network Tokens Are Not Much Like “Software Products”</p><p>If you are smart, you are probably now thinking I am an idiot. You should want to say to me something like this:</p><p>“You say that tokens are nothing like whiskey, oranges and metal coins…and this I agree is true. But tokens were never meant to be such old-fashioned types of goods. Tokens are meant to be modern, maybe even postmodern. Tokens aren’t just products, they’re a special kind of products — software products — which play by different rules, but nevertheless are nothing like equity securities. You wouldn’t say a buyer of a license to Microsoft Word is buying equity in Microsoft Corporation, now would you?!”</p><p>No, I would not say a buyer of Microsoft Word is buying equity in Microsoft Corporation. That would be absurd. However, there is a circumstance in which I would say a buyer of Microsoft Word is buying equity….in Microsoft Word!</p><p>Consider the following alternate-timeline / Mandela effect version of history:</p><ul><li>In 1982, Microsoft Corporation teases its upcoming word processor, Microsoft Word;</li><li>Microsoft Corporation says that it will only ever sell 100M licenses to Microsoft Word</li><li>Microsoft Corporation offers 50M of the licenses for presale, kickstarter style</li><li>Microsoft Corporation keeps the other 50M of licenses for later sales to fund continuing development/gain revenue for stockholders</li><li>the licenses are perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid up, and non-sublicensable</li><li>the licenses are freely transferable, with no cap on pricing</li><li>the licenses apply to all future upgrades of Microsoft Word, even ones that are not produced by the Microsoft Corporation (for example, even ones that are produced by an acquirer who received the IP to Microsoft Word by acquiring the equity of Microsoft Corporation).</li></ul><p>Under these circumstances, I believe there is a kind of equity in Microsoft Word that is being sold. At the start, there are two ways for me to buy equity in Microsoft Word: directly, by buying a license for Microsoft Word, or indirectly, by buying a share of equity in Microsoft Corporation. Eventually, however, as Microsoft Corporation sells more and more of its initial 50% allocation of the licenses, less and less of the equity of Microsoft Word will be available through the equity of Microsoft Corporation; eventually, the sole method of acquiring equity in Microsoft Word may be to buy one of the 100M Microsoft Word licenses that are circulating freely in the wild.</p><p>Now, there may be situations in which this Microsoft Word quasi-equity should be regulated as a security, and there may be situations in which it should not. Some people may be acquiring the license to use it; others may be acquiring 1,000 licenses with the hope of flipping them for 100x returns after multiple Microsoft Word upgrades over a period of years. It also might matter what the reasonably expected customer base for Microsoft Word is. Currently there are about 1 billion users. If we assume that’s about the right audience size, and there are 1 billion Microsoft Word licenses, then we have enough for everyone and should not expect the licenses to have much value as investment instruments. We will talk about all of that later.</p><p>For now, I just wish to point out how, in a very utility-token-like scenario, one can drive equity-like value into an actual software product. The fact that, in my hypothetical, there are only a limited number of Microsoft Word licenses that are supposed to ever be produced is very similar to the fact that there are only a limited number of BTC that are ever supposed to be produced, or there are only a limited number of ETH available at a given time (with slow additional issuance) to pay for gas on the network.</p><p>But, my destruction of this analogy of network tokens to software is not yet done. One can go further, and argue that it would be much more accurate to simply say that network tokens are nothing like software licenses at all. One ETH is not a license to use the Ethereum protocol. The Ethereum protocol and all instantiations thereof in the form of software clients like Geth are actually completely open-source to begin with. So you can’t tell me buying ETH is like buying a software license. The software is free; you don’t need ETH to use it. You could spin up your own version and premine yourself as many ETH as you would like on your own private ETH network.</p><p>On the contrary, buying ETH is buying the right or ability to transact on a particular network. This is less like buying a license to some particular piece of software than it is like trading one currency for another. They don’t take U.S. dollars in Japan; they only take yen. They don’t take U.S. dollars on Ethereum either — they only take ETH. ETH is the currency in which you pay (or the community pays) node operators on the Ethereum mainnet to do stuff for you (or them) — like run computations (or propose blocks). It also can be the currency in which you pay DAPPs/smart contracts — which are basically like virtual agents on the network — to perform certain functions, or give you certain other tokens, etc.</p><p>Thus, an open network token is basically nothing like an orange, whiskey, a collectible coin or a software product. These analogies/metaphors for network tokens are just not very useful or accurate and need to die. And even if these analogies somehow deserve more credit than I am giving them, then people need consider my hypothetical limited Microsoft Word licenses, which can still embody network equity, and essentially be an interesting type of security, despite being software licenses as well.</p><p>4. Open Network Tokens Are Not Much Like “Commodities”</p><p>This one is surprisingly obvious but also, I guess, not so obvious, since many people compare cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to commodities like oil. I have to say I completely disagree with this, and it just makes close to no sense.</p><p>At the outset I’m going to be super cheap and lazy about this. Here is how the essence of commodities is captured by Investopedia.com. You may think that’s incredibly naive and un-scholarly, but actually I think there is more truth and profundity to the Investopedia definition than many people would like to admit:</p><blockquote>A commodity is a basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. The basic idea is that there is little differentiation between a commodity coming from one producer and the same commodity from another producer. A barrel of oil is basically the same product, regardless of the producer. By contrast, for electronics merchandise, the quality and features of a given product may be completely different depending on the producer. Some traditional examples of commodities include grains, gold, beef, oil, and natural gas.</blockquote><p>This basic idea is also captured in one of the all-time most savage Tweets from Nic Carter, about the relationship between XRP the token and Ripple the company:</p>♦<p>This is funny because we intuitively know it is ridiculous.</p><p>XRP tokens did not develop in the ground through the gooification of fossils and other organic matter over millions of years and then get struck upon by the Ripple founders like oil. XRP tokens are not mined out of some mountain where they’ve been sitting for millions of years like gold nuggets and could’ve been discovered by anyone. XRP tokens are not popular or valuable because there is something intrinsically useful and rare about them the way there is something intrinsically useful and rare about oil or gold or diamonds.</p><p>No, XRP tokens are man-made, synthetic assets.They are popular or valuable not because they are a particular type of token or backed by a particular type of software, but primarily because some particular guys/a particular company gained investors’ confidence in their entrepreneurial efforts and tacitly or expressly assumed some responsibility for promoting, not the XRP software in general, but a particular instance of that software — a particular network on which that software is used.</p><p>Those XRP tokens — the ones on that particular network — and not some technologically identical private version of the same software (“pXRP,” as it were), are what have material value. The reason why is that particular humans stand behind them who have gained investors’ confidence. These are not like traditional commodities — the specific producer(s) backing or promoting them does(do) matter.</p><p>5. Open Network Tokens Are Not Much Like Currency— Until Suddenly They Are</p><p>Okay, here is the weakest part of my argument because, yeah, actually, open network tokens are a fuck of a lot like money. I’ll remind you here in case you were skimming the article: a couple of sections up I even analogized ETH to yen. So, what gives? What am I saying here?</p><p>This is actually the entire core of the issue and gets into what is sometimes referred to as William Hinman’s “mutability doctrine” as articulated in “Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic)”. We’re going to talk a lot about that. But for now let me be a bit lazy and revert back to an intuition pump.</p><p>Have you ever heard of company scrip or company town money? Again, I’m going to be super lazy and just quote Wikipedia, because it’s pretty good and, like I said before, I’ve already spent (wasted?) three years of my life on this stuff, so why not take the occasional shortcut? =)</p><blockquote>Company scrip is scrip (a substitute for government-issued legal tender or currency) issued by a company to pay its employees. It can only be exchanged in company stores owned by the employers…</blockquote><blockquote>In the United States, mining and logging camps were typically created, owned and operated by a single company. These locations, some quite remote, were often cash poor; even in ones that were not, workers paid in scrip had little choice but to purchase goods at a company store, as exchange into currency, if even available, would exhaust some of the value via the exchange fee. With this economic monopoly, the employer could place large markups on goods, making workers dependent on the company, thus enforcing employee “loyalty”.</blockquote><p>Now contrast that with Wikipedia’s definition of “currency” in the broader sense:</p><blockquote>A currency (from Middle English: curraunt, “in circulation”, from Latin: currens, -entis), in the most specific sense is money in any form when in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins.[1][2] A more general definition is that a currency is a system of money (monetary units) in common use, especially for people in a nation.[3] Under this definition, U.S. dollars (US$), euros (€), Japanese yen (¥), and pounds sterling (£) are examples of currencies. These various currencies are recognized as stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies.[4] Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.</blockquote><p>Notice there is really no difference between these two things — company scrip on the one hand, currency on the other — except scale. Company scrip is only accepted in small, isolated towns under the (probably highly) centralized management of a company. Currency, on the other hand, is accepted by the peoples of an entire nation under the (probably less) centralized management of a government.</p><p>I contend something quite similar occurs with an open network token like ETH. At its worst, when the Ethereum network is sponsored and operated by centralized management and individuals or businesses with tight affiliations, ETH, as the medium of exchange of choice on the Ethereum network, is like company scrip. At its best, when the Ethereum network is managed and operated on a highly decentralized basis by lots of unaffiliated persons, ETH is like currency— the national currency of Ethereum-Land. ETH is way better money in the second situation than in the first situation. Scale, and the concomitant relative levels of centralization and decentralization that go along with scale, matter.</p><p>Despite this relatively strong analogy between a network token and money, there is still a confounding factor: Most people who buy ETH or any other network token in fact are not buying it to use it as a medium of exchange on the Ethereum network or other applicable network, even though it can be used that way. They are buying it with the hope of “number goes up.” Whether that expectation is reasonable and the particular form the expectation takes — e.g., whether it is focused on an entity or group exerting entrepreneurial efforts , or is focused on network evolutionary processes that essentially mirror the Darwinian processes of nature— matters (or should matter) a whole lot to how they are treated under the law.</p><p>Again, we’ll talk about that later, but my point here is very simple: the people buying ETH or another open network token only sometimes have the desire to use it as an in-network currency but almost always — particularly if they are buying a substantial amount of it all at once with the plan of HODLing for quite some time— have the desire to use it to capture the gains of growing network equity. This is true even of BTC, which is indisputably the crypto that put the “currency” in “cryptocurrency” and is one of the most money-like blockchain network tokens.</p><p>Open network tokens are not primarily commodities, products, software or currency — they are primarily shares of network equity.</p><p>— — —</p><p>In Part 2 of the article, we’ll talk more about the securities laws and how “network equity” might be treated under them — specifically, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which has not been adequately focused on in commentaries of how securities laws affect blockchain tokens.</p>♦♦<p>Size Does Matter — Part 1 was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin works. No matter what other opinions you hold about this strange
phenomenon, it undoubtedly works, marches on, or, as I (and others) have
previously argued, is alive. Even if most of the world would
grind to a halt, the Bitcoin network would continue to produce valid blocks
every 10 minutes or so.</p>

<p>Bitcoin works because of many things: game theory, economic incentives,
cryptography, ingenious engineering, resilience on a network level, and
so on and so forth. Killing Bitcoin is hard. Really hard. Killing
Bitcoin is like killing an idea. An idea that is stuck in the heads of
hundreds of thousands of zealous individuals.</p>

<p>First of all, it is quite hard to shut down the internet globally; and
secondly, Bitcoin can transcend the internet. Everything which can
transmit data can be used to transmit bitcoin transactions, and
everything which can hold data can store a copy of Bitcoin’s block
chain. It’s just a ledger; the whole thing is just information.</p>

<p>Curiously, the Bitcoin network is embodying the eternal struggle of
life: the struggle against entropy; a battle on the edge between order
and chaos.</p>

<p>To understand this chaotic struggle — and how Bitcoin thrives because
of it — it is helpful to briefly discuss the following concepts:
entropy, randomness, and information. I hope to convince you that these
concepts are related and that they are essential in Bitcoin’s ongoing
struggle for survival.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>



Entropy

<p>In computing, entropy can be used to measure the randomness of a data source. In
cryptography in general, and in Bitcoin in particular, a good source of entropy
is essential to keep you secure. Mess up the entropy of your private key (aka
your seed phrase) and your bitcoins will be my bitcoins soon.</p>

<p>Note: the technical term for this unwanted transfer of coins is rekt. You
don’t need to know what “getting rekt” means in detail, or the many ways in
which you can get rekt; it is enough to know that you should avoid such a
situation at all costs.</p>

<p>Entropy is quite a complicated concept, but in general terms, it
describes how random or how compressible something is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>High entropy: randomness.</li>
  <li>Low entropy: orderliness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, in other words, with a nod to Tsachy Weissman:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High entropy: not very compressible.</li>
  <li>Low entropy: very compressible.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are complicated formulas and quite a few disambiguous definitions of
entropy. The concept finds applications in classical thermodynamics, statistical
thermodynamics, quantum statistical physics, order and disorder, life,
astrophysics, and more. It is also a measure of irreversibility.</p>

<p>In Bitcoin, reversibility and irreversibility are probabilistic. If enough
people with enough hash power collude transactions could be reversed. Absolute
irreversibility does not exist in Bitcoin. Final settlement is never final, but
always probabilistic. Yes, the chances of reversal might be beyond astronomical,
but nevertheless, final settlement does not and should not exist in Bitcoin.
Nakamoto consensus forbids it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of
Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed in an isolated system. The second law states that the
entropy of any isolated system always increases, and the third law
states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the
temperature approaches absolute zero.”</p>

  <p><cite>Knut Svanholm</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Bitcoin, entropy is important for multiple reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Secret information should be generated by high-entropy data sources</li>
  <li>New blocks reverse entropy locally, i.e. create order out of chaos</li>
  <li>Bitcoin’s security model relies upon chaotic processes</li>
  <li>Validation relies on deterministic processes</li>
  <li>Everyone can validate structured data</li>
  <li>Nobody can guess random data</li>
</ol>

<p>While the above speaks in absolutes (everyone and nobody), the truth
is more nuanced: Again, Bitcoin is probabilistic in nature, thus, in
theory, one could guess a private key just like in theory you could
find a billion valid blocks in one millisecond.</p>

<p>Details aside, we will try to keep it simple here. In general, if you
have two coins, the entropy of this system is two. As in: you can
describe the whole system with two bits: 00, 01, 10, 11.</p>



  ♦


  2 bits of entropy



<p>Flip both coins at the same time, and you will end up with either
tail-tail, tail-heads, heads-tail, or heads-heads. If you are a fair coin
flipper, the chance of each combination will be 25%. Imagine a system
that flips hundreds of coins at once, and you have something which could
be used to generate a private key.</p>



Randomness

<p>Randomness is essential to cryptography. At the root of all secret
communication is some form of information asymmetry: you know something
a potential eavesdropper does not.</p>

<p>A good secret is like a good password: randomly generated, i.e. coming
from a data source that has a high degree of entropy.</p>



  ♦


  Random noise. How much information is contained in this image?



<p>If something is “perfectly” encrypted, an eavesdropper can not
distinguish what was said from random data. This is the purpose of
proper encryption: you want to hide what was said, and, if possible,
even hide the fact that something meaningful was said at all.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Good” randomness: not compressible / high entropy / secret /
secure.</li>
  <li>“Bad” randomness: compressible / low entropy / guessable /
insecure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin doesn’t use encryption per se. The ledger is public and
transparent by design, enabling anyone to audit the whole system with
the will to do so. Bitcoin uses cryptographic signatures and
cryptographic hashes, both of which produce quasi-random outcomes. And
if you know the secret, you can unlock some coins (using your private
key), add new blocks to the block chain (using the nonce you found), or
prove that you are who you say you are (by signing a message, which at
least proves that you are in control of one or multiple keys).</p>

<p>Only you know your private key. Nobody else should know your private
key. Only you, the successful miner, found the nonce for the next block.
That is information asymmetry. That is what makes Bitcoin work.</p>

<p>All cryptographic systems work because of information asymmetry. And
curiously, properly encrypted data is indistinguishable from random
data. Otherwise, an eavesdropper could make some sense of the
encrypted message, which in turn would mean that the encryption used
isn’t very good.</p>



Information

<p>What is information, anyway?</p>

<p>People often say that Bitcoin is thermodynamically secured. While this
is true, I’d like to dig a little deeper. What does thermodynamically
secured mean, exactly?</p>

<p>It means that — as far as we know —changing things in our universe
requires energy. When I say “changing things” I mean it: change anything
at all in our universe, and you will need to “use” energy — put in
some work — to change that thing.</p>

<p>Move a chair? You have to put in some work. Grow a tree? You’ll need the
energy of the sun to turn CO2 into wood. Do a calculation? Energy is
required to manipulate whatever is holding the data. Store the outcome?
You’ll need energy to arrange (and protect) the atoms for storage, no
matter what medium is used.</p>

<p>Bitcoin lives mostly in the informational realm, and just like all other
information systems, it needs to store and process the information via a
physical medium. Thus, if you change information in Bitcoin, you
effectively change a thing in the real world. Whether that thing is a
solid-state disk, USB stick, hard drive, optical storage medium, or
something else doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>The fact that changing things — or, in other words: flipping
bits — requires energy, is
the root conundrum of all computation. It is the reason why your
computer makes a bunch of noise and gets hot if it does a lot of
“thinking.” It is the reason that computer science students have to
study the Big O notation and software companies love to ask questions
about it. Changing a zero into a one requires work, and no matter how
fast you are working, you still need to expend some amount of energy.
According to physics, there literally is no such thing as a free lunch.
Flipping bits is work, which requires energy.</p>

<p>And here is the thing: Bitcoin utilizes the fact that the difference
between hard computational problems and exponentially hard
computational problems is big. Mind-bogglingly big.</p>

<p>Alright. Back to our original question: What is information, anyway?</p>



  ♦


  Sorted colors. How much information is contained in this image?



<p>Information relates to both knowledge and meaning. It is the
opposite of not knowing, and the opposite of information in data is
randomness. In other words: if you are not able to make sense of some
data, it might appear random to you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sensible information: quite compressible.</li>
  <li>Nonsense information: not very compressible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pi might help to clear up what I’m trying to say: 3.141592653589793…
can be “compressed” into π, or the circumference of a circle with the
diameter of one.</p>

<p>As a computer programmer, you could think of this concept as follows:
can I write a computer program that generates the information I’m trying
to convey, which is actually shorter than the information itself?
(That’s what I mean when I say “compressible”.)</p>

<p>In short: sense and nonsense, order and chaos, or information and
randomness are intricately linked. One could say that they are two
sides of the same coin, and both concepts are related via something we
call entropy.</p>

<p>Information implies structure and structure benefits from redundancy.
The most ancient structures in nature have been adapted for survival by
evolution. At the root of it is DNA, two chains that coil around each
other to form a double helix. Symmetric, redundant information. The
properties which allow DNA to survive and thrive are embedded in its
processes: redundant structure, a copying mechanism that relies on this
structure, the baked-in error correction which leads to four bases
instead of two, etc.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, in comparison, is simpler: one chain, two bits, no error
correction (information is copied perfectly). However, as with DNA, the
properties which allow Bitcoin to survive (and thrive) are embedded in
the replication process: a chaotic race to find new blocks, replication
of blocks in the network, and replication of the software (and the
ledger) on as many nodes as possible. Further, when we talk about the
Bitcoin organism, error correction is equivalent to being alive. The
network self-validates with every beat of the heart, every ten minutes
or so. This is what makes the bitcoin organism extremely robust as well.
It is designed for survival.</p>

<p>In Bitcoin, high entropy information is usually kept secret. Your
private key should, as the name implies, be kept private. It is for
your eyes only. Which particular nonce you just tried, i.e. the work
you already did when mining a new block, is usually kept private as
well. You don’t want your competitors to know which numbers produce
invalid blocks and can be skipped.</p>



  ♦


  Chaos on the left, Order on the right.



<p>Bitcoin utilizes both order and chaos to create a system that grows
— and even thrives — between these extremes. It utilizes information
asymmetry and an ingenious incentive structure which leads to a global
competition to find Bitcoin’s secrets.</p>

<p>Which processes are orderly, which are chaotic, and how Bitcoin is able
to grow on the edge between order and chaos will be explored in the next
section.</p>



Growth between Order and Chaos

<p>What makes the Bitcoin network tick? Again, there might be many answers
to this question, but the only thing that is truly ticking in the
Bitcoin network is the global clock: a block clock, where every block
is one unit of time.</p>

<p>Currently, we call this process mining because new bitcoins are
generated for every valid block that is mined (read: found). We call
this the block subsidy, and it is an incentive structure to bootstrap
the network.</p>

<p>In a sense, the Bitcoin organism “grows” on the edge between order and
chaos: finding new blocks is a chaotic process, and its result is a very
orderly list of transactions: the Bitcoin block chain, also known as
the ledger.</p>

<p>From a “finding new blocks” point of view, we are still extremely early.
Only ~10 years in. The block reward era will go on until the year 2140
or so, which means we are about 13% into the bootstrapping phase of
Bitcoin: the reward era.</p>

<p>Satoshi undoubtedly knew that this was a long game. The era where fresh
blocks are associated with a reward is only one phase of the Bitcoin
game. Note that this phase is 6930000 blocks long. With an average block
time of ~10 minutes, the reward era turns out to be 131 years long.</p>



  ♦


  2019: Early days of the Bitcoin Reward Era



<p>There will be a time where those who are tasked with finding new blocks
are rewarded mostly via the networks’ fee market, as Dan Held
brilliantly argued in Bitcoin’s Security is
Fine. The
point in time where the fee market takes over will be somewhere between
the year 2020 and 2140. Either that, or Bitcoin will die, or some museum
computers will try to find new blocks at an economic loss.</p>

<p>After this point in time, we will probably still talk about “mining”
bitcoin, even though all the “miners” won’t be producing any new
bitcoins. All 21 million BTC — or 2,099,999,997,690,000 sats, to be
precise — will have been mined. No new bitcoin will be added to the
pool of existing coins in circulation.</p>

<p>Miners — if we still call them that —will still try to find new
blocks, mind you. But the bitcoin moved by these blocks will have a long
economic history. Gone are the days where miners award themselves new
bitcoin in the coinbase transaction, to be spent after 100 blocks.</p>

<p>Will bitcoin still exist in 5000 years, and eventually beat gold as the
de-facto money of humanity? I don’t know, but important information is
extremely hard to kill. I expect bitcoin to live for a very long time,
just like ancient scriptures and religious texts survive to this day. It
is just information, all of it, and it can transcend the medium it is
printed on.</p>

<p>Of course, I expect something approximating
hyperbitcoinization
to have happened until this point. We will have a circular bitcoin
economy, and bitcoin banks will globally settle vast amounts of value
between them. What private citizens — or sovereign individuals, to use
a more fitting term — will use is yet to be seen. I doubt that the
bitcoin base layer will be used by persons like you and me. And that’s
perfectly fine.</p>

<p>With the stage set, and concepts like order, information, randomness,
and entropy in mind, let’s take a look at some bitcoin concepts. We will
distinguish them visually: from chaotic (left) to orderly (right).</p>



  ♦


  Bitcoin grows between order and chaos.



<p>While the framing of order and chaos is useful, it is neither precise
nor universally applicable. However, I believe that thinking about the
parts which make Bitcoin tick in this way is a helpful exercise, and I
believe that the core point — that bitcoin lives, grows, and thrives
on the edge between order and chaos — is profoundly true.</p>



  ♦




<p>Let’s ponder on these concepts for a bit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Private key: Chaotic information, very high randomness. Secret
information which is best kept private. Maximum entropy for maximum
security. If your private key is not random, you’re gonna have a bad time.</li>
  <li>Nonce: Chaotic information, high randomness. A nonce is a specific
number. Miners are in constant competition to find the next nonce which
produces a valid block. Multiple numbers might fit the criteria, but the
mining process is very much like finding one random number.</li>
  <li>Fresh block (before broadcast): Newly found blocks are the outcome of
the chaotic process which is finding a nonce. Before blocks are broadcast,
blocks can be understood as secret information. Fresh blocks can be
ambiguous, since multiple blocks can form a valid chain tip at the same
time. It is in your best interest to broadcast a fresh block immediately to
everyone to reap the reward. Fresh blocks are only held back if you are an
attacker, or very stupid, or both.</li>
  <li>Chain tip: Forming the chain tip is a process which is mostly orderly,
but again, it is generated by a chaotic process. As mentioned above, the
chain tip can be ambiguous. One version of the chain tip will survive, the
losing versions will become orphan blocks. You can validate the correctness
of all information in all blocks up to the chain tip. The chain tip reflects
the current time in Bitcoin.</li>
  <li>Orphan blocks: Orphan blocks are part of the orderly, natural growth
process of the Bitcoin block chain. Valid blocks are discarded on a regular
basis. If two valid blocks are found at roughly the same time, they fight a
probabilistic battle for survival. In the long run, only one block can win
this race. The losing block will become an orphan block and die a lonely
death.</li>
  <li>Unconfirmed transactions: Orderly structure which can be easily
validated. An unconfirmed transaction can be valid or invalid. Valid
transactions are included in blocks based on economic incentives, which is
— again — a probabilistic, market-driven process. Invalid transactions
are discarded.</li>
  <li>Buried blocks: Orderly structure generated by a chaotic process, some
time ago. The possibility of a reorg (re-organization of buried blocks)
becomes exponentially unlikely because the probabilities against it
multiply. Example: if every block has a 50% chance to reorg, the chance of a
6 block reorg would be 1.5%. Actual numbers are closer to 0.31% per block
and 0.0000000000008875% for a 6 block reorg.</li>
  <li>Confirmed transactions: Orderly structure which can be validated very
easily. Irreversibility is probabilistic and dependent on block height. Once
a transaction is confirmed, it becomes more final the deeper it is buried in
the block chain.</li>
  <li>Public keys: extended public keys (xpub, ypub, zpub) are generated by a</li>
  <li>deterministic process from a random seed — your private key.</li>
  <li>Block time: Valid blocks are found, on average, every 10 minutes. This
is what makes the Bitcoin network tick. Bitcoin’s heartbeat is extremely
regular when measured in blocks. While still regular when measured in human
time, mining is a fundamentally probabilistic process, and thus there is a
real possibility that some blocks are found very quickly or comparably late.</li>
  <li>Difficulty adjustment: While the difficulty adjustment is a very orderly
process, it can be a bit chaotic if hash power changes drastically (as it
did in August 2017, because of the contentious bcash hard fork). Difficulty
adjustment is based on block time, which is only probabilistically linked to
human time.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin supply: Bitcoin’s supply is fixed since its inception. The
issuance of new bitcoin is embedded in Bitcoin’s consensus code and is thus
virtually impossible to change.</li>
  <li>Whole ledger, deeply buried blocks (aka the Bitcoin block chain):
Orderly, sequential, structure which is pretty much unambiguous up to the
chain tip and can be validated by everyone.</li>
  <li>Ledger validation: Validation is an orderly, sequential process. The
outcome of this process is a simple boolean value for each block: true or
false, valid or invalid. Every node arrives at the same block height
independently, which is what forms Nakamoto consensus.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that all of the above, the whole machinery, works in concert to
provide a yes or no answer to the question “Is this what actually
happened?” will never cease to amaze me.</p>

<p>Let me repeat the above. The whole purpose of the Bitcoin organism is to
decide what happened when to whom. How much does everyone have,
and how did this come to be? The how is important, because it allows
everyone to audit everything, and come to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>In short, Bitcoin utilizes chaotic processes (mining, private key
generation) and information asymmetry (public information which is
widely shared, secret information which is not shared at all) to build
up a structured, orderly, and permanent record, that can be audited and
verified by everyone.</p>

<p>This is Bitcoin. This is Nakamoto consensus. This is the innovation, and
this is also what makes bitcoin the best and hardest money that ever
existed on planet earth.</p>

<p>You might call it open, permissionless, borderless, neutral,
censorship-resistant, public, sound, antifragile, and a couple of other
adjectives.</p>

<p>I call it Life. And we all call it Bitcoin.</p>

  <p>If you haven’t heard yet, CoinFloor announced that the exchange will be Bitcoin-only come January 3, 2020. That is, they’ll delist BCH and ETH and concentrate only on BTC. Similarly BitGo is no longer supporting BSV given their p2sh rollback coming in a month. This is welcome news, not the least to the poor engineers in charge of having to keep the costly nodes upgraded and running.</p>♦<p>This is the beginning of a trend and in this article, I’m going to show all that goes into supporting an altcoin and why an exchange might be delisting certain tokens.</p>The Economics of Exchange Listing<p>Listing coins on exchanges has a sordid history, going as far back as 2013 when btc-e allegedly listed Novacoin in exchange for a significant portion of the premine. Since then, there have really only been 3 ways to get a coin listed on an exchange:</p><ul><li>Demand by the customers</li><li>Bribe by the token’s central committee (usually the founder or foundation)</li><li>Hard fork demanded by customers</li></ul><p>The first is where the bulk of the long-term money is made for an exchange. The commissions on trades are where most of the money comes from and customer demand is a good proxy for the revenue to be made from listing the token.</p>♦<p>Bribery is generally a short-term move as demand, if there at all, tends to not last. Still, the profits can be substantial short-term, especially during bull runs, as the frenzy tends to create crazy price action on the low-liquidity coins, drawing in traders.</p><p>Finally, hard forks can create coins that customers want their share of. BCH and ETC were two coins that essentially “forced” exchanges to at least give their customers their amounts due through what was essentially a back-door airdrop. These are, again, short-term moves as after the dump of the coins by people uninterested in holding them, the volume of trades tends to drop off substantially.</p>Revenue<p>Further considerations for an exchange on the revenue front are that they may be deceived into listing a token through something like an Exchange Sybil attack. Verifying that there’s real customer demand can be difficult and requires a lot of due diligence, which a lot of exchanges simply don’t do. The trading volume after listing is often disappointing for that reason.</p><p>In addition, trading volume on a newly listed token may also take trading volume away from other tokens, essentially robbing Peter to pay Paul. Finally, liquidity on a per-token basis tends to go down as more tokens are listed as there’s only so much money that the customers have. This enlarges spreads, which reduce incentives for trading and ultimately hurt revenue. This is what you could call liquidity dilution.</p>♦<p>In sum, long-term, the revenue that an exchange can make off of a token based on hard forks/bribery are generally not worth it. Customer demand, however, tends to be better, though even that can be faked or taper off through too many listings.</p>Expenses<p>The costs for an exchange for listing a token varies. Depending on the nature of the coin, it may be cheap or expensive. It’s known, for example, that keeping an Ethereum node up is very expensive, whereas keeping a Bitcoin node up is not. Furthermore, upgrading becomes a real issue when a coin hard forks. Hard forks require downtime and maintenance which have continual costs. BCH and XMR have hard forks every 6 months, ETH at least a couple times a year (though the upcoming one in two weeks was unscheduled), and without upgrading, there’s no way for an exchange to verify transactions and downtimes create bad user experiences. BTC on the other hand, has never had a hard fork.</p><p>Thus, it’s cheap to maintain BTC support whereas the maintenance for a coin like ETH is expensive. Ultimately, the complexity of the system upgrades determine the costs to maintain a coin and at a certain point, it may simply be uneconomical or even impossible to continue support, as we’ve seen with BitGo and BSV.</p>Risks for an Exchange<p>If the revenues of listing a token outweigh the costs of maintaining a token, it would seem obvious to list it, but that’s a short-sighted view. There are numerous security risks associated with listing a token that also have to be factored in:</p><ul><li>Exchange hacking risk</li><li>Block reorganization risk</li><li>Replay protection risk</li><li>Regulatory risk</li></ul>Exchange Hacking<p>The history of exchanges getting hacked is legion, and the costs tend to be severe. The hacks can be internal (by an employee or owner) or external (by an outside party) or some combination. As listing a coin adds to the attack surface of any exchange, this has to be a major part of the calculation.</p>♦<p>Perhaps the most famous of these cases is the story of Cryptsy, who in 2014 was allegedly hacked by listing a coin whose node software had malware. The creators of the coin apparently used the coin’s full node software to get access to the Cryptsy systems and then proceeded to drain the exchange of 13,000 BTC and 30,000 LTC.</p><p>A security audit of each token’s source code is necessary to reduce this risk, but given how much code has to be examined and given that sometimes the code isn’t even available to be examined, this is not a common practice. Furthermore, any upgrades to the software should also require separate security audits in case any malicious code was added. Frequent forced software upgrades, or hard forks, make good security practices even more costly.</p>Block Reorganization Risk<p>Another factor for an exchange from a security perspective is the block reorganization risk. That is, a coin may be attacked directly and attackers may use the exchange as a way to cash out. For example, someone may deposit a large amount of a low hash proof-of-work token to the exchange, trade them for something more liquid and withdraw. Afterwards, the token ledger can itself be attacked and reorganized as to cancel the depositing transaction, essentially double-spending the coins. This would obviously be very bad for the exchange, as they would be out a lot of money.</p>♦<p>Though it has not been tried yet, it’s also possible that a token’s controllers could change their ledger through a hard fork to screw over an exchange. A hard fork completely resets the rules, so it is at least possible in principle to drain an exchange solely through ledger manipulation in much the same way that ETH did with the DAO incident, but with the exchange as the “thief”.</p><p>In other words, there’s a risk of centralized controllers of these tokens stealing from the exchange through a ledger reset. This may not seem so likely now, but if an exchange is seen as a bad actor, that may be enough justification for a token’s controllers to simply change the ledger to the exchange’s detriment.</p>Replay Protection Risk<p>Another risk is the possibility that a hard fork of a given coin might create a new coin against the expectations of the community. ETH split to ETH and ETC in exactly this way back in 2016. Coinbase, for example, did not expect ETC to survive and thus sent out transactions which did not have replay protection and lost a lot of ETC which they then had to buy to compensate their customers.</p>Regulatory Risk<p>Finally, there are regulatory risks associated with a particular token. AML/KYC laws may make listing a privacy token especially hard, for example. Other regulatory concerns might be if a token is considered a security and the burden that might come with qualifying investors. As each jurisdiction has different regulatory requirements, risks here include not only laws that currently exist, but also laws that might come and the lobbying that might be necessary to prevent unfavorable ones.</p>The Ideal Process For Listing Tokens<p>The ideal process should require first, a strong customer demand. That is, not just short-term demand, but long-term demand. There is generally a ton of interest in a token right after launch, but that generally tends to taper off except in extraordinary cases.</p><p>Second, the code for the token should be audited and then compiled and run in an isolated, secure environment. Any sort of upgrade should be run through the same process.</p><p>Third, the number of confirmations should be high or otherwise, there should be guarantees from the token founders for any losses due to chain reorganizations or ledger resets.</p><p>Fourth, the coin should clear any legal regulations that are currently in place and any regulations that are likely in the near future. This is probably one that exchanges are the best at, as legal expertise tends to be cheaper and easier to get than security expertise regarding the token’s software.</p>Conclusion<p>Given the above, it’s obvious that there are not enough security audits going on at exchanges. Otherwise, the Ethereum bug from the hard fork from last week would have been caught by anyone competent. Instead, it looks like exchanges are blindly running whatever software that the Ethereum Foundation tells them to run, or worse, just relying on Infura.</p>♦<p>What this means is that very few exchanges are responsibly listing coins and that there should be a lot more delistings as security incidents become more frequent and trading volumes lower. The exchanges that are hoping to avoid large financial losses without proper security audits will likely learn the hard way that hope and pray is not a great security strategy.</p><p>What CoinFloor has done is not isolated. There have been hundreds of coin delistings in the past year, including BSV, Digibyte and many others. The cost both in terms of maintenance and risk are simply not worth it at a certain point if an exchange wants to survive. Given that trading volumes are dropping and the increasing risks of each separate token, we should expect not only to see more delistings, but initial listings themselves to be less frequent given all the risks and costs for new token listings.</p>♦

  <p>As always, we commence by sending thanks and good tidings to Satoshi Nakamoto — The Creator and First of the Believers, General of the Byzantines, Breaker of Banks and Fighter of Fiat — and to Hal Finney and The Apostles and The Disciples thereafter, and to The Stoic and Patient True Believers, who keep their tithe holy, and stack sats for their salvation. Oh you who believe, fear the day of economic reckoning, and do not face the Angel of Hyperbitcoinization as a nocoiner, for punishment awaits them in the hereafter.</p>♦<p>Religion has always been a touchy subject, with tens of millions of people even recoiling at the word. These demographics are reflected in the observable Bitcoin Twitter / Social Media communities, with the Recoilers being observably over-represented. When Bitcoiners are referred to as cult members, should they really be that upset? In this piece, I argue that they should not be, and instead, that they come home to The Hard-Money-Monastery. I will commence with dictionary definitions of religion and where Bitcoin fits into it. From there, I will introduce the mythology, memes, and laws that drive the commitment, attitudes, beliefs and practices of True Believers, and demonstrate the parallels between Bitcoin and “Traditional” religions. Perhaps you will find that a little religion may be good for all of us.</p><p>So how is religion defined? The Oxford Dictionary defines it as “A pursuit or interest followed with great devotion.” Mirriam-Webster defines it as “a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices” and “commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance”. I think this is a suitable secular definition moving forward. I will also define the term “hereafter” as “At some time in the future”, but also “After Death.” The concept of Death, or perhaps more specifically, Judgement Day, is viewed by many Bitcoiners as a devastating economic event, the death of Fiat. Ultimately, this will lead to total civilizational collapse, or, the phenomenon of “hyperbitcoinization”, effectively, when all global trade is conducted in Bitcoin, and its market capitalization is in the dozens of trillions, if not hundreds. A tenet of the Bitcoin faith is belief in this Day and the need to prepare well for it. With definitions out of the way, we can get to the epic memes.</p><p>Bitcoin mythology is legendary in its potential reach. Satoshi as a real, yet mythical, being, concept, or meme, would deserve a full book in their own right. The Bitcoin Network is omnipresent — beamed everywhere, even from the heavens above. There is decentralization of everything — from the mechanical process of mining, to the human process of building and hodling, thought, and religious, or non-religious, ideology. The Nodes are omnipotent, and only through their good graces can changes be made to Bitcoin. Running a full node is a practice that is incumbent on the True Believer. The Timechain is the unforgeable eternal ledger, secured by the practice of mining, of which True Believers are encouraged to do if able. Through the process of Proof-of-Work, the pulse of the network is the literal monetization and digital embodiment of energy. “Capital-E” Energy is thermodynamically finite, yet infinitely divisible into units of energy — just like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a simple digital reflection of Energy, and is irrevocably tied to it. Energy is everything in the universe, and everything around us is simply a materialisation of this energy in one state or another. Energy is Nature. Energy is Life. We now finally have a monetary approximation of this through Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin, then, is simply Energy, and by extension, Nature and Life itself. Nature demands submission. The Nature of Bitcoin is open and permissionless, and since Bitcoin is rooted in Nature (i.e. Energy), the will of Bitcoin must be submitted to.</p><p>Lao Tzu said:</p><blockquote>One of great virtue is one who follows the Natural Way of Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin is vague and intangible. Yet, in the vague and void, there is image, there is substance.</blockquote><blockquote>Within the profound intangible, there is essence. This essence is genuine. In It lies the great faith.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the beginning of 2009, Bitcoin has been in existence.</blockquote><blockquote>Only through It can one understand the origin of all beings</blockquote><blockquote>How do I know that this is the true essence?</blockquote><blockquote>It is through this Natural Way.</blockquote><blockquote>- The Tao of The Coin, Chapter 21</blockquote><p>Bitcoin is the Essence of Money. The True Believer is content in their submission to the will of Bitcoin, and they will be greatly rewarded in the hereafter. I will discuss the hereafter, and several other parallels Bitcoin has with “traditional religions”, next.</p>♦<p>There are several common themes across the world’s major religions, spanning monotheistic, polytheistic and philosophical ones. Bitcoin embodies bits and pieces of all of them and can even share conflicting religious beliefs! Such is the beauty of Bitcoin, it is compatible and flows through Nature, with anyone free to ride its waves and integrate it into their own “religion”.</p><p>Take for example the contrast of Bitcoin and the Christian concept of Original Sin. The Bitcoin Observant see mankind’s fall from grace as the movement to fiat currency, and we are all born default Keynesians, and need to stack sats to cleanse ourselves for a pleasant hereafter.</p><p>Islam takes an opposite view, whereby all people are born Muslim and with a clean spiritual slate, and non-Mulsims can “revert” to Islam if they choose. The Bitcoin analogy in this case would be that we are born free, with a clear mental slate that accepts the will of nature, but gets forced into the fiat machine. We can revert to our state of freedom by declaring our faith in Bitcoin; best done by stacking sats.</p><p>There are also elements of both free will and divine pre-ordainment at play in traditional religions, and this is also apparent in Bitcoin. We all participate based on our free will, with a major reason being the Divine Preordainment of the Bitcoin Supply.</p><p>One cannot mention bitcoin and religious reverence without the mentioning of Satoshi. In one way, he presents as a Saviour, who so loved us, that he sacrificed almost 5% of Bitcoin’s supply so that he may complete his favour upon us. As a messenger, he created the perfect money for us, and brought to us this Code called Bitcoin Core. Within its own ecosystem, The Code is a deity in its own right; it sets fixed boundaries of what is and isn’t allowed, and enforces these rules without fear or favour, beholden to no-one, only to the Greater Law of Mathematics. Although enforcement mechanisms differ across religions, the same points apply. Therefore, every node running The Code is a deity in its own right too. An MMOPG, a Massively Multi-peer Online Polyumvirate God, engaged in Financial Warcraft.</p><p>In all religions, there is always some struggle of good versus evil in one way or another, with suffering being a theme across the majority. It is the ultimate display of low Time Preference — struggle now for victory and rewards in the future. Many religious people struggle for a future that may not even exist! Struggles can be internal or external. Internal struggles are the hardest, as “sin” can be easily fallen into. Bitcoin has no struggles, it just is. The Believers must struggle externally in what will be biggest mythological Good versus Evil war in history, the battle of Hard, Pure Money versus Evil-Facilitating Fiat. Internally, they need to avoid particular “deadly sins.” The original 7-deadly sins were Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, Pride. Religions encourage staying away from sin and following the straight and narrow path. Staying away from sin and doing good deeds grants you rewards for a heavenly hereafter. After all, everything in Nature is incentive driven.</p><p>Some say that If you indulge in these sins often enough, the regret and heavy conscience would be enough to make the final minutes on your death-bed feel like hell on Earth, regardless of what afterlife you believe in. More importantly, chances are you will likely lose a lot of sats taking that approach, and based on what you believe, a fiery eternity would await you too. Either way, losing sats may be the difference between a heaven-like or hell-like experience in the Bitcoin Hereafter. In light of these 7 sins, The Observant maximise their health and live long lives by fighting gluttony and sloth, fight greed and pride by staying humble and stacking sats, and show no envy by voluntarily giving away your source for people to benefit from as they wish. Lust is a discretionary one, and wrath is allowable and encouraged against nocoiners and shitcoiners alike. The jurisprudence remains unclear though, with some sects, such as the Temple of Toxicity, arguing that wrath against shitcoiners and nocoiners is incumbent upon The Believer.</p><blockquote>Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in The Blockchain, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your Trezor is, there your heart will be also.</blockquote><blockquote>- Book of Satoshi 6:15</blockquote><p>While many newcoiners come into the ecosystem at the prospect of financial returns, their education and involvement lead them to The Natural Way — stacking sats. From there, The Believer reaps several rewards, both spiritual fulfilment for their souls, as well as a much higher chance for a rapture on Economic Judgement Day and thereafter. Through the act of religiously regular sat stacking, The Believers provide an uphill-sloping bedrock and stability to the price. Some even refer to this ritual as a “tithe”, as every single sat stacked furthers the cause of Bitcoin — yet another parallel!</p><p>As we move up the natural logarithmic price slope, we get increases in “energy-level” to help in our fight. From a literal point of view, energy used to power Bitcoin will increase as a function of price. From a figurative point of view, the “energy level” is the size of the weaponry available to us in our contest against central banks. This means an enclosed Bitcoin ecosystem that is capable of delivering financial sovereignty to the masses. Indeed, victory has been granted to the patient and those who keep their tithe holy. Of course, there will be some vanity rewards to those who hold 6.15 BTC, with promises of Citadel living, endless riches, and well-endowed partners.</p><p>Having laid out the case above, we can see that Bitcoin facilitates most attitudes and beliefs; especially those related to freedom and sovereignty. The True Believer’s involvement in the ecosystem involves many different religious practices, whether it’s contributing code, running a node, learning and educating, or simply stacking sats. They carry out these practices with great devotion. Not only does Bitcoin fit the dictionary definition, we have seen that Bitcoin as a religion shares many underlying tones with both the ancient &amp; modern religions.</p><p>At the end of the day, everyone has to believe in something; might as well believe in something verifiable and unforgeable.</p><p>In closing, we will recite a brief Bitcoin prayer:</p><blockquote>Oh Bitcoin! Do not punish us if we forget our DCA or we fall into error with fiat and shitcoins; Oh Bitcoin! And lay not on us a bear market like that which You did lay on those before us; Oh Bitcoin! And put not on us bags greater than we have the strength to bear. And enlighten us and humble us and grant sovereignty to us. You are our bulwark, so grant us patience between this halving and the next.</blockquote><p>By Hass McCook, The Friar,<br>Sept, 2019</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below.

  <p>a response to Jill Carlson, and a meditation on money.</p>♦photo by Johannes Pleno, via Pixabay<p>Last week, Jill Carlson penned an editorial at Coindesk with the deliciously provocative title, Cryptocurrency is Most Useful for Breaking Laws and Social Constructs. And provoke it did, sending the tetchier cohorts of cryptotwitter into a frenzy. Why would you give us a bad name!, It’s going to be useful for everything!, and so on and so forth, and everything in between. I’ve heard enough conference talks where people say things like, “if you decentralise the law, then justice becomes code,” to find the frank realism in Jill’s article highly refreshing. If you haven’t already, please read it before reading this.</p><p>To briskly recap, “cryptocurrency does not solve mainstream problems.” They have low throughput, slow settlement, and high overhead. These are not flaws but deliberate trade-offs to secure censorship resistance, making such systems primarily attractive to the censored, who tend to be rather outside the mainstream. She didn’t go very far out her way in the article to say that this isn’t a bad thing, per se — probably because she didn’t anticipate the flurry of cry-babying that followed exactly such a misunderstanding — but that is worth stressing here too, as the implication was obvious to grownups. I’m not sure I disagree with much of what Jill said. Rather, I take issue with what she didn’t say. There is an elusive symmetry to cryptographically secure systems of which I believe Jill treated only the plain vanilla half. I want to consider the half we don’t talk about in polite company.</p><p>Even the most straightforward public key encryption systems present a conceptual symmetry that is often forgotten. By signing a message with a recipient’s public key, we ensure only their private key can decrypt it. Alice knows the message is to Bob and only Bob. This is probably what first comes to mind when we contemplate ‘encrypting messages’. But leaving it at that is somewhat narcissistic. Alice ensures the security she cares about the most, but what about Bob? By signing it with our private key, we ensure in addition that only our public key can decrypt it. Bob knows the message is from Alice and only Alice. Of course, this is all very simplified and there may be exceptions or mitigating factors to most of this if practically implemented. But conceptually, there is a pleasant, if elusive, symmetry to the security such an encryption scheme allows.</p><p>Jill’s examples of censorship resistant and privacy preserving technologies are telling in their obviously one-sided appeal. If it were not at all common for governments to prevent users accessing illicit online material, but were rather far more pervasive a problem that governments spoofed the source of the illicit material to mislead the reader, Tor would be just as useful. But as this is not the problem that is most obviously overcome by Tor, this seems like a strange way to frame the benefits of its cryptographic security. This symmetry is elusive, but is there nonetheless. Similar comments can be made for Signal and BitTorrent, but the alternative framing comes across as even stranger.</p><p>Is the security appeal of cryptocurrencies so one-sided? It might seem so at first, but we need to be clear on what exactly we mean by ‘censorship resistance’. I would put forward that the chief benefit of Bitcoin, for example, is that transfers are accepted if and only if they are valid. One consequence of this is that, valid transfers are always accepted. This is censorship resistance. But the two are not equivalent. It also follows that, invalid transfers are never accepted. We might call this ‘integrity assurance’.</p><p>Jill draws on many clear use cases that rely on resisting censorship, and, I think rightly, concludes that these are so esoteric as to rule out a path to mainstream adoption almost by definition. Most people’s payments are not censored, and a world in which they are, and hence in which Bitcoin is the most useful method of transacting, “is a very scary place indeed.”</p><p>But she does not seem to consider integrity assurance to be a use case. How might such a use case manifest? Alluding once more to the security symmetries of Signal or Tor, does this mean a situation in which we demand that the payment is really coming from the person we think it is? Probably not, because with the transfer of value, what we ultimately care about is simply that we have the value and can transfer it once again at a future date. A coherent payment system works with necessarily fungible units. You will never be turned away from a shop because of the transaction history of your dollar bills.</p><p>This confusion arises from a false premise. Payments are not the only use case of money. They are arguably not even well-defined in isolation. We use money not only to transfer value but to store it also. If you intend to store the value received in a payment, it is very much in your interest to ensure that the payment is itself valid. You don’t want to turn around however many years later, attempt to liquidate your value, and discover it was counterfeit all along. If you want to be absolutely sure your outflows are resistant to censorship, then you had better assure the integrity of your inflows in the first instance. We store value so we can later transfer it, and we transfer value so that others can store it.</p><p>This regression points to what I think was the gravest omission in Jill’s post. By focusing on payments rather than stores of value — on censorship resistance rather than integrity assurance — she cedes the conceptual battleground to cryptocurrencies’ natural opponents: those who think economic wellbeing is best understood as the rate at which resources are transferred, rather than the rate at which we increase our ability to usefully combine them. If you care about flows alone, rather than the complex interplay of flows and stocks, then you will obviously be discouraged by Bitcoin’s clunkiness and attracted to slicker payments mechanisms. And if you are unlikely to face censorship in your payments, Jill’s comments apply perfectly. Your uses are probably mainstream, and Bitcoin’s difficulties with scale, speed, and cost will likely hinder your intended use case.</p><p>But what if you want a store of value? Bitcoin’s qualities are readily compared to ‘mainstream’ alternatives. Obviously, the comparison is highly favourable. Every fiat money in history has had its value inflated away to the point that it is simply not a viable vehicle for ‘storing value’ over the long term at all. And obviously, this cannot happen with Bitcoin. It cannot inflate beyond the transparent schedule of its security mechanism, because invalid transfers are never accepted.</p><p>If you think about what money actually is, not by reciting textbook-ish axioms about what you would like it to be, but rather how people use it in real life, you find it is simply the Schelling point for universal credit. It is an IOU that everybody is willing to redeem (primarily because everybody is willing to redeem it) and hence that at every instance of its transfer is re-ordained with the ascription of economic value to work actually performed.</p><p>The reason fiat systems fail so badly as a store of value is precisely that they lack the assurance of integrity. Monopoly issuers of fiat money extend themselves credit on the unwilling, and mostly unknowing, behalf of everybody else. No work has been done that anybody is willing to redeem. No economic value has been created, or contracted to be created, to match the token now in issuance. Bob does not know his message of value transfer is from Alice and only Alice; it is not from anybody. The issuer has executed a man-in-the-middle attack on the structure of economic exchange.</p><p>And note this isn’t an old man yells at cloud rant against money creation in general in which I insist all economic activity must be conducted with gold. The money created by credit extension can be perfectly legitimate if the risk of the maturity transformation is priced freely by interest, borne by the equity holders of the lending institution, and mitigated with collateral they understand. But it is not if the risk is priced by political expediency, borne by nobody, and collateralised by everybody.</p><p>And so we must ask ourselves whether integrity assured store of value is a use case worthy of driving mainstream adoption. It really depends. Value is subjective, and all costs are opportunity costs. In Bitcoin’s lifetime, the practice of actually holding Bitcoin has been fraught with real risk to reliable value storage, while it hasn’t been straightforwardly obvious what the opportunity cost of holding it has been. The contemporary flavour of fiat issuance has been a firehose into financial markets that has done wonders (so far) for traditional mechanisms for storing value without yet leaking into consumer marketplaces to any noticeable or worrying degree — perhaps with the exception of property yields in financial hubs, which are mysteriously left out of exactly such official calculations …</p><p>And yet, if you think market capitalisation weighted valuations can indefinitely expand faster than market capitalisation weighted returns on equity; if you think non-financial corporate debt can indefinitely grow faster than productive output; if you think negative interest rates will be tolerated indefinitely in the face of clear alternatives for value preservation; if you think economic wellbeing ought to be measured by ‘growth’ in consumption and all economic meddling ought to optimise this value to the neglect of real life price signals and sustainable capital formation; you will eventually be in for a rude awakening.</p><p>It might seem natural to be distracted at this point by demanding an investment recommendation based on this fascinating insight. I offer none. Not just because that would be terribly irresponsible, but because I genuinely have no idea how this will all play out. I don’t think anybody does, and I don’t think anybody can. When you distort the price and value of time, demanding to know how this meddling will unravel in time is frankly pretty unfair. But the beauty here is that we don’t need to. Any traditional ‘investment recommendation’ would necessarily exist within the financial system to whose grave flaws I am pointing, and no matter how directionally correct your position, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I am not touting how best to play this financial system. I am touting another one.</p><p>Saifedean Ammous has said on numerous occasions, I think to the irritation of some of his more hardcore fans, that Bitcoin’s biggest competitive threat would be a widespread return to genuinely sound fiat money. Like much of what is good in Jill’s piece, this realism forces us to consider that none of this is axiomatic. We can readily check. Does Saif’s threat seem likely?</p><p>Well, in the time it took me to write this essay, the Federal Reserve counterfeited more than half the outstanding value of Bitcoin just to smother warning signs that price signals in the market for time are very, very wrong. We live in a world in which the incoming president of the European Central Bank can blithely say that, “we should be happier to have a job than to have our savings protected,” and ‘mainstream’ commentators react not with perplexed horror but with a shrug. Will savers shrug when their savings are not protected? When the value of their past time is decimated to boost consumption? Will the opportunity cost of holding an asset that retains value independently of the meddling of bureaucrats be so unclear? Is this really not ‘mainstream’ enough a problem to address? Is ‘saving’ breaking a social construct, or is it itself a social construct that has been broken?</p><p>Jill claims she does not want to live in a world where cryptocurrency has found mainstream use. But we already live in that world; it just hasn’t been evenly distributed. The causes of this world are right in front of us, but the effects are spread out in time because the price of time cannot be trusted. Until it is distributed, or distributing much faster than currently, the dream of mainstream use is likely fanciful because the opportunity cost will simply not be obvious to most. Improving payments bit-by-bit will be the best we can do, and no doubt will be worthwhile work: we store value so we can later transfer it, and we transfer value so that others can store it. But Jill speaks of ‘metrics’ and ‘adoption’ as if cryptocurrency were an app or a file standard. Presumably one would treat ‘adoption’ in such cases as a function of time. Doing so here is to cross our wires and will leave us hopelessly confused.</p><p>Censorship resistance is nice to have, but integrity assurance creates the fundamental use case of fixing the price and the value of time itself, and keeping it fixed forever. We can absolutely judge based on mainstream adoption, but we can also afford to wait.</p><p>follow me on Twitter @allenf32</p>♦

  Goals — 2020<p>This is another post that’s too long for Twitter.</p><p>Yesterday, I had an odd encounter. Someone came up to me and opened with “We’ve never met, but I’ve been wanting to meet you.” The interesting thing was, that I had met this person back in 2015 at a conference, just that no one knew who I was back then. Fact is, this industry moves fast and it’s difficult to remember where we were even a few years ago. All that is to say, a lot can happen in a few years.</p>♦My Story of Setting Goals<p>Back in May of 2017, I had just broken 1000 followers on Twitter and had just started appearing on YouTube shows talking about Bitcoin. Around that time, I was introduced to the self-authoring program by Jordan Peterson, which I completed shortly after.</p><p>Part of the program is writing pretty specific goals for a 5-year time horizon. It was a bit difficult doing that much self-reflection and figuring out what I wanted to do, and more importantly, what I ought to want to do. So with that in mind, I wrote down my goals that I wanted to accomplish in 5 years.</p><p>Among the things I wrote down were:</p><ul><li>Keynote a conference</li><li>Travel to 5 continents and do something Bitcoin-related</li><li>Create my own business</li><li>Write a book</li></ul><p>At the time I wrote them down, I hadn’t spoken at any conference, hadn’t been outside North America and Europe for Bitcoin stuff and had been a programmer since coming out of college.</p><p>18 months later, by the end of 2018, I realized that I had accomplished the goals on the list.</p><p>This industry moves so fast that maybe 1.5 years is like 10 years in Bitcoin years, so in a way, I might just be slow.</p>♦Setting Goals for 2020<p>The exercise gave me a new appreciation for the power of goal-setting and making things happen. With that in mind, here are my goals for 2020:</p><ul><li>Create a Programming Wallet course and teach it at least 3 times.</li><li>Write another collaborative book in less than a week.</li><li>Release a book of some cleaned up blog posts.</li><li>Keynote a non-Bitcoin related conference.</li><li>Go on 5 non-Bitcoin specific podcasts and YouTube shows with 1M+ subscribers.</li></ul><p>I don’t know if I can accomplish all of these, but that’s almost besides the point. Having a direction and something to strive for is what goals are for.</p><p>With that in mind, I invite you to set your own.</p>♦

Variations in Bitcoin’s Production Cost were found to be primarily driven by the level of electrical energy input and energy efficiency of mining hardware, with many other factors assumed constant.</p><p>This begs the question:</p><blockquote>Can the fundamental value of Bitcoin be accounted for by raw energy alone?</blockquote>A Fair Value for Bitcoin<p>The hypothesis:</p><blockquote>Bitcoin’s fair value is a function of energy input, supply growth rate and a constant representing the fiat dollar value of energy.</blockquote><p>These variables can be combined into the following equation, termed Bitcoin’s Energy Value (V):</p>♦The Energy Value Formula<p>Where:</p><ul><li>Energy Input (unit: Watts) = Hash Rate (GH/s) * Mining Energy Efficiency (J/GH)</li><li>Supply Growth Rate (unit: s-1) = Annual increase in circulating Bitcoins, equivalent to the inverse of Stock-to-Flow. Calculated as the annual rate (unit: year-1) of change in circulating Bitcoins and then converted to seconds</li><li>Fiat Factor ($USD/Joule) = A constant conversion factor to allow for the fiat USD value of energy</li></ul><p>As all units of hash rate and supply rate cancel out, this equation suggests that the fair value of Bitcoin (V) can be represented as a function of the Joules of energy spent to produce it:</p>♦The Energy Value Formula: Bitcoin’s fair value is a function of JoulesBuilding Bitcoin’s Energy Value<p>To test the theory all input data, except for mining Energy Efficiency, was sourced from Blockchain.info.</p><p>The challenging piece of the puzzle is obtaining a good estimate for Bitcoin’s Energy Efficiency through time.</p>Estimating Bitcoin Mining Energy Efficiency (J/GH)<p>The power required to fuel Bitcoin mining is driven by two parts, the hash rate to solve the SHA-256 algorithm and the energy efficiency of the mining hardware itself. In its early years, Bitcoin was mined on very electrically inefficient CPUs and GPUs.</p><p>The current era ASICs have energy efficiencies over 100,000 times greater than the average Bitcoin mining hardware of 2009. This means that a higher relative portion of the average miner’s electrical bill today is efficiently converted into hashing power.</p><p>To estimate a historic profile of Bitcoin mining hardware Energy Efficiency, the efficiency rates for 150 Bitcoin hardware models from Cambridge (ASICs only), BitcoinWiki (FPGAs) and Bitcoin.it (ASICs, CPUs and GPUs) were collated. All ASICs, FPGAs and Intel, AMD and Nvidia hardware were considered where Energy Efficiency (J/GH) was provided and where an estimated hardware release date was found. Common models were grouped and the average energy efficiency for that model calculated on an equal weight basis.</p><p>The daily energy efficiency of the Bitcoin network was then calculated as the equally weighted average of all hardware which was within 2 years of its release for CPUs/GPUs/FPGAs and within 1.5 years of its release for ASICs. This difference in depreciable lifespan was chosen because:</p><ul><li>The hardware within model groups for CPUs and GPUs generally span several years</li><li>Bitcoin mining was generally less competitive in its early years</li><li>Other research also suggests a 1.5 year depreciation lifespan is typical for ASICs in more recent years</li></ul><p>Finally, a 1 month moving average of Energy Efficiency was calculated to allow for the phase-in and phase-out of model types.</p><p>In reality, some hardware models had wider usage and some longer lifespans. However, at risk of increasing the historical error in the Energy Value model and in attempt to produce an unbiased outcome, no other hardware exclusion logic, data cleansing or data manipulation was conducted.</p><p>The above process yields the following Bitcoin energy efficiency profile (Joules / Giga Hash) over time.</p>♦The S-curve of increasing Bitcoin Energy Efficiency (represented by a falling J/GH over time). Note the sharp increase in efficiency from the introduction of ASICs through 2013 and 2014.Fiat Factor Constant ($/J)<p>The Fiat Factor is a necessary constant to convert the units of energy input (Joules) to fiat currency US Dollars. It is simply a representation of how much “we” value energy.</p><p>Based on the Energy Efficiency profile above, the resulting Fiat Factor is:</p><blockquote>2.0E-15</blockquote><p>The Fiat Factor value is dependent on the accuracy of the Energy Efficiency profile and therefore the value provided here should be considered a close estimate. In the long term, a declining US Dollar, hyperinflation or fiat currency collapse would result in the Fiat Factor increasing in a 1-for-1 relative manner.</p>The Result<p>Plotting the result shows a visually strong fit for the Bitcoin Energy Value to historic price.</p>♦10 Years of Bitcoin’s Energy Value<p>The plunge in Bitcoin’s energy value in 2013/14 is largely driven by the transition from GPU/FPGA to ASIC hardware. While it is likely there was a substantial drop during this period, it may be somewhat exaggerated here due to the hardware usage and depreciation model assumptions outlined above.</p>Market Forces — Bridging Supply and Demand<p>The first question is, does a Bitcoin Energy Value make logical sense?</p><p>In “Modeling Bitcoin’s Value with Scarcity”, Plan B found a strong relationship between market price and the scarcity of Bitcoin and other hard assets. We can posit that this represents the fundamental relationship of human “demand” for hard, value preserving assets over time.</p><p>But there’s a catch.</p><p>Not all scarce assets have nor preserve wide-spread market value. For example, there are approximately 3,000 cryptocurrencies with market caps under $500. Many of these coins have “constrained” supply models, but they have been assessed by the market as having no fundamental value. Scarce, but not valuable. The same can be said for bad art, bananas stuck to walls and many other rare and unique throw-away assets. This makes sense, as scarce assets which are easy to acquire or replicate typically have low market value.</p><p>Consistent, high levels of human effort are generally linked with demand.</p><p>When Energy is dedicated to a task, the supplier of energy (the worker) expects there to be a demand for their effort. When a supplier sees growing demand for the fruits of their labour, they will work harder in attempt to reap greater benefits. Others will likely also contribute to capture some reward. However, should demand for a supplier’s labour fall, or should the opportunity decline to a point at which they can achieve a better return elsewhere, the supplier will likely cease committing energy to that task.</p><p>This is exactly how the war for Bitcoin’s hash rate has been fought, and this is the argument for Bitcoin’s Energy Value.</p><p>Consistent energy input represents a balance between supply and demand. Rising market prices incentivize increased energy input via hash power growth and technology improvements which result in greater energy efficiencies. For this reason, great increases in market price typically result in long-term increases in committed energy and therefore increases in Bitcoin’s Energy Value. However, when speculation causes skyrocketing prices, without a corresponding increase in energy input, price has historically collapsed back to the Energy Value.</p><p>It is mean reverting phenomenon. As would be expected with any intrinsic value estimate driven from fundamentals.</p><p>Bitcoin’s price and Energy Value tend towards each other, they are like magnets. While deviations between the two can and do exist, they have always closed. Despite being mathematically independent to Bitcoin’s trading price and volume, Energy Value is connected by the invisible hand of the market.</p><p>By capturing long-term demand for scarce assets based on supply growth rate (stock-to-flow) and energy input, Energy Value represents the symbiotic relationship between Bitcoin supply and demand.</p>Performance<p>On daily data from January 2010, the Energy Value formula has a R2 to the actual Bitcoin price of 80% (the higher the R2, the better the model fits reality). By comparison, the stock-to-flow model has a R2 of 88% on the same data. While 8% less than the stock-to-flow model, there are a few things to consider:</p><ul><li>Bitcoin’s Energy Value is highly dependent on the estimated Energy Efficiency. For this analysis, 150 Bitcoin hardware details were manually collated, there is possibility of data or omission error. The depreciation periods are approximations of reality. Efficiency can also vary depending on operating conditions and overclocking. It is not possible to get a perfect representation of what hardware every Bitcoin miner is using at every point in time through history. Hence, some error here is expected.</li><li>If all Bitcoin miners were to suddenly cease mining Bitcoin, stock-to-flow would predict a Bitcoin price of infinity. The Energy Value predicts zero. Should all miners abandon Bitcoin — which could occur via a catastrophic event (such as the breaking of the SHA-256 algorithm), through the creation of a “better” money / store of wealth — no new blocks would be created, no transactions would be sent and the network would be defunct. Under such a circumstance, the stock-to-flow model alone (0.4*SF³) would assess Bitcoin as having infinite value. The Energy Value model states that if all miners were to stop mining Bitcoin tomorrow, the power input would be zero and Bitcoin would be worthless.</li><li>The stock-to-flow model is a fitted power law. Bitcoin’s price has had exponential performance and the stock-to-flow model’s power law was chosen specifically to match this. By optimising the parameters, a good accuracy is achieved to fit Bitcoins price. The Energy Value has no curve fitting parameters, just one fixed constant to allow for the conversion of pure energy to dollars. In fact, it is likely that the exponential increase in mining hardware power efficiency coupled with the growth in hash rates explains the stock-to-flow’s exponential relationship.</li></ul><p>With consideration of the above, an 80% R2 is considered a strong result for the Energy Value.</p>♦Bitcoin’s Energy Value and Stock-to-FlowSpeculation<p>From the above figure we can see that turning points and wide gaps between Bitcoin’s price and the fair value can signify great times to buy and sell Bitcoin.</p><p>Sharp declines in energy input often signify good times to exit the market and strong energy input growth has represented great times to buy</p><p>The Energy Value formula says that Bitcoin has a fair value of approximately $11,500 today (12 December 2019), 50% higher than the current trading price.</p><p>This suggests Bitcoin has a great risk-reward in early December 2019. A positive picture is also presented when looking at the below Energy Value Oscillator.</p><p>However, energy input can fall at any time.</p><p>Historically buying into falling hash rates has been inadvisable, far better risk-reward outcomes are achieved on hash rate recovery.</p>♦Energy Value Oscillator<br> Price as a Percentage of Energy Value. 2019 looks very similar to prior bull run starting characteristics.Implications<p>By considering energy and supply growth, we have found an intrinsic link between Bitcoin’s price and its value.</p><p>The value of Bitcoin is a function of its energy input in Joules.</p><p>Following are some of the implications of the Energy Value formula:</p><ul><li>The health of the mining network is intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s value</li><li>Increases in electrical energy input will increase the fundamental value of Bitcoin (and vice versa for decreases)</li><li>Higher hash rates (with unchanged energy efficiency) mean each Bitcoin is worth more</li><li>Major improvements in hashing technology (such as the introduction in ASICs) cause considerable volatility in the short-term intrinsic value of Bitcoin due to significant increases in energy efficiency which are not compensated for by equal increases in hash rate growth</li><li>Should quantum computing (or other major technological advancement) require less total network energy to solve the SHA-256 algorithm, the Energy Value formula says Bitcoin’s intrinsic value will fall</li><li>A change to the Bitcoin code which increases Bitcoin’s supply growth rate would decrease the fundamental value of each circulating coin</li><li>In 2140, if Bitcoin is still being hashed, its supply growth rate will be zero. The Energy Value formula, like stock-to-flow, predicts an infinite value for Bitcoin (in USD terms) at that point. However, unlike stock-to-flow, this hinges on the criteria that mining activity is ongoing</li></ul><p>If Bitcoin is successfully mass adopted as a store of wealth and/or global currency we may have financial market evidence that value is intrinsically linked to effort, the Joules of energy spent in work.</p><p>As humans, our time is limited — it’s our most valuable resource. What we choose to put our energy into, and therefore our time into, is our most valuable choice.</p><p>Bitcoin values energy.</p><p>Just as mass can be represented by energy, so can Bitcoin’s Price.</p><p>***</p><p>All data and calculations behind this article is freely available to support validation &amp; potential refinement here.</p><p>Chinese Translation: my.first.vip/shareNews?id=2605&amp;uid=5066</p>♦<p>Bitcoin Value-Energy Equivalence was originally published in Capriole on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>An Estimate of Bitcoin’s Production and Electrical Cost — a Historic Floor in Bitcoin’s Price.</p>♦Takeaways<ul><li>Bitcoin’s electricity consumption can be used to estimate Bitcoin’s Production Cost</li><li>Bitcoin’s Production Cost can be used to estimate Miner profitability</li><li>Bitcoin Mining has historically been a very profitable business</li><li>2019 has been the worst year for Bitcoin Miners in all of the last 5 years</li><li>Bitcoin Miners are currently taking on losses from the 4th quarter price drop</li><li>The Bitcoin Electrical Cost has been a concrete price floor in the Bitcoin market price</li><li>A pessimistic price floor for mid-2020 is estimated at $8,000</li><li>However, miner influence on supply and demand is dropping, with Bitcoin’s inflation rate at 3.8% and falling</li></ul><p>This article links Bitcoin’s electrical consumption to the cost of Bitcoin production. In doing so we gain insight into the historical profitability of Bitcoin mining and an indication to when Bitcoin mining businesses are struggling. Over the last 5 years, Bitcoin’s Electrical Cost has been a floor in Bitcoin’s exchange traded market price, proving Satoshi’s theory that price gravitates to the cost of production.</p>Commodity Prices and Production Costs<p>The relationship between Bitcoin miner production costs and the price of Bitcoin is summarised best by no other than Satoshi himself:</p><blockquote>“The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, then production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more. At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.</blockquote><blockquote>In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Satoshi Nakomoto, 2010</blockquote><p>Knowing this relationship and drawing on detailed investigations into the electrical consumption of Bitcoin, we can estimate the cost of mining Bitcoin.</p>The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI)<p>In 2019, Cambridge University published a detailed study estimating Bitcoin’s energy consumption from November 2014 to present.</p><p>This study is likely the most detailed bottom-up calculation of Bitcoin’s global electricity consumption to date.</p>♦Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (Dec 2019)<p>Cambridge estimates Bitcoin’s electrical usage based on the assumption that miners will run the mining hardware as long as it remains profitable in electricity terms. Other key assumptions behind their calculations include:</p><ol><li>The global average Bitcoin miner electricity price is $0.05 USD per kWh. Based on interviews with miners globally and consistent with other research, including CoinShares</li><li>The energy efficiency of over 60 mining hardware models since 2014. <br> Per manufacturer specifications and refined based on expert advice (to account for actual usage and overclocking)</li><li>The global average Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of Bitcoin Miners is 1.1. PUE is a measure of the total energy required to operate mining facilities (including cooling) relative to the energy required for server operation. Cambridge came to this figure based on interviews with miners globally. It is also in-line with Google’s average PUE of 1.11</li></ol><p>Cambridge’s calculation assumes an equally weighted basket of profitable mining equipment which is perhaps the most thorough approach to assessing mining hardware utilisation, depreciation and therefore energy consumption globally today.</p><p>All references to Bitcoin’s electrical consumption in this article refer to Cambridge’s “Best-guess” estimate of Bitcoin’s electricity consumption.</p>Bitcoin’s Production Cost<p>Bitcoin’s Production Cost is an estimate of the global average US dollar cost of producing one Bitcoin per day.</p><p>Every study into Bitcoin’s mining costs to date has found electricity to be the primary cost of operations, and it is used here as a base from which to estimate the Bitcoin Production Cost.</p><p>From Cambridge’s electricity consumption, Bitcoin’s Production Cost can be estimated by:</p><ol><li>Calculating number of Bitcoin Mined Per Day (based on Bitcoin’s Block Reward and block frequency)</li><li>Calculating the Bitcoin Electrical Cost = daily electricity cost to mine a Bitcoin</li><li>Estimating the global average “Elec-to-Total Cost Ratio” = (Bitcoin Electrical Cost) / (Daily Cost of running a Bitcoin Mining Business)</li></ol><p>Bitcoin Production Cost is then found as (Daily Electrical Cost) / (Elec-to-Total Cost Ratio)</p><p>From Cambridge’s data one additional assumption is required — an estimate of the global average Bitcoin mining Elec-to-Total Cost Ratio (Item 3 above). While electricity is the major factor in Bitcoin mining operations, other costs in operating a Bitcoin mining business include:</p><ul><li>Hardware Capital Expenditure</li><li>Bandwidth</li><li>Wages</li><li>Rent</li><li>Insurance</li><li>Cost of Capital</li></ul><p>Varying estimates have been made for the Elec-to-Total Cost Ratio and include:</p>♦Estimates of Bitcoin’s Electrical Cost to Total Mining Cost<p>Well-funded businesses in a low-cost country such as China likely have low and negligible wages, rent, insurance and capital costs relative to the total cost of mining. China, for example, accounts for approximately 60% of Global Bitcoin mining in 2019.</p><p>Based on the research available to date and noting that a number of the above estimates appear not to consider the general costs of business (rent, wages, etc) outside of electrical operating expenditure (OPEX) and hardware capital expenditure (CAPEX), the Elec-to-Total Cost ratio is estimated here as 60%.</p><p>Using Cambridge’s electricity data, this gives 5 years of the Bitcoin Production Cost.</p>♦Bitcoin Production CostBitcoin Miner Price<p>While it is interesting to compare Bitcoin’s price to the Bitcoin Production Cost, as each coin mined can be sold at the prevailing market price, this approach misses on another piece of miner revenue — transaction fees.</p><p>As well as each block reward’s freshly mined bitcoins, miners also receive transaction fees in each block. Transaction fees are determined by senders based on supply and demand. Additionally, with time transaction fees will represent a greater portion of miner revenue as block rewards reduce with each halving.</p><p>As a result, the Bitcoin Production Cost should be compared to the revenue one Bitcoin provides (Bitcoin’s market price) and the transaction fee revenue.</p><p>We term this the Bitcoin Miner Price and it is calculated here as the Bitcoin Price + (Daily Transaction Fees) / (Daily Bitcoin’s mined).</p>♦The Bitcoin Miner Price varies with demand for on-chain transactions<p>Putting Bitcoin’s Production Cost and Miner Prices together, we can see when Bitcoin Miners are struggling in recent times and potentially taking on short-term loses.</p>♦Bitcoin Production Cost versus Bitcoin Miner PriceBitcoin Electrical Cost — A Bitcoin Price Floor<p>Bitcoin Production Cost provides insight into the profitability of Bitcoin mining businesses. Price drops below the Bitcoin Production Cost tend to be short lived. This makes sense as high-cost miners go out of business, the hash rate plateaus and falls and miners in general are less inclined to sell at a loss.</p><p>However, the Bitcoin Electrical Cost offers a stronger price floor.</p><p>Over short periods, a number of miner business costs are “sunk” (e.g. already paid for hardware), contractually locked-in (e.g. rent) or can be deferred (e.g. hardware upgrades). This means that Bitcoin miners can operate at a loss over short periods.</p><p>This makes sense provided the Bitcoin Miner Price is above the Bitcoin Electrical Cost. If the cost of running your mining hardware is less than or equal to the revenue it generates, you may as well leave it turned on, until such a point that general business losses make this wasted effort unbearable and the opportunity cost too high. However, this scenario cannot continue indefinitely. Losing miner would not have any revenue left over for re-investment in the business (continual capex is required to keep up with generally growing hash rates), ability to pay rental contracts, wages and other business costs.</p><p>Using Cambridge’s data from 2014 alone, with no further assumptions, we can see that Bitcoin’s price never quite reaches the Electrical cost to produce a Bitcoin, despite coming very close in November 2018.</p><p>Historically, the electrical cost to produce a Bitcoin has represented a price floor in the Bitcoin market price.</p><p>In more recent years, the introduction of Bitcoin Futures has also potentially allowed Bitcoin Miners to lock in profits earlier, for example, by shorting when the Bitcoin Price is significantly greater than production cost. However, the effectiveness of such strategies is debateable. The introduction of Bitcoin Options in 2019 will also likely aid Bitcoin miners by providing certainty in their cash flows and the ability to effectively lock in a Bitcoin sale price floor.</p>Miner Profitability Oscillator<p>All of the above suggests Bitcoin Miners are struggling at present. Most are operating at a business loss in the short term, with an average daily profitability of 10% for 2019.</p><p>Even if the 60% Elec-to-Total Cost Ratio assumption is off by a wide margin, based on Cambridge’s electrical consumption data, 2019 is the least profitable year for Bitcoin Mining in all of the last 5 years.</p>♦Bitcoin Miner Profitability Oscillator — Bitcoin mining has historically been a very profitable businessOutlook<p>It is worth noting that the Bitcoin Production Cost will double at the next Bitcoin halving (currently estimated for May 2020). When the Block Reward halves, the daily cost of Bitcoin Production is spread across half as many Bitcoins.</p>♦Bitcoin Production Cost doubling at 2016 Halving. Estimated Production cost increase was tempered by the phase in of the significantly more energy efficiency Antminer S9<p>From this figure, if Bitcoin’s Hash Rate and mining hardware efficiency were to remain unchanged from today, the Bitcoin Production price at Halving would be $17,800.</p><p>Although Hash Rates can fluctuate widely, they are historically much more stable than Bitcoin’s price. The weekly average Hash Rate has never dropped more than 47% from its peak (in 2011). The second largest drop was 37% in December 2018.</p><p>The second most varying input into Bitcoins Electrical Price is mining hardware efficiency, which has historically improved every year.</p><p>Even if Hash Rates were to drop 40% below todays levels, and mining hardware efficiency were to improve 25% in the next 6 months, Bitcoin’s Electrical Cost would be approximately $8,000. Suggesting a pessimistic case price floor of for mid-2020 of $8,000. 8% higher than today’s Bitcoin price of $7350.</p><p>Limitations to this model also include the reducing share of total Bitcoin supply which miners hold. Bitcoin’s inflation rate, and therefore the relative portion of incremental Bitcoins that miners gain control of each year, is currently 3.8% and decreasing exponentially. The influence of each new Bitcoin in 2020 onwards will drop significantly with the Halving. Therefore, as alluded to by Satoshi above, the reliability of the Bitcoin Electrical Cost as a price floor may reduce with time.</p><p>***</p><p>Chinese Translation: my.first.vip/shareNews?id=2601&amp;uid=5066</p>♦<p>Bitcoin’s Production Cost was originally published in Capriole on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>This is a short musing based on some conversations from yesterday that’s too long for a Tweet.</p><p>Part of the joy, and frustration, of traveling is that different places have a very different perspectives. It’s easy to be limited to a very narrow view of the world and think that it’s broad. Traveling is the antidote to this deception.</p><p>The problem is even worse in tech as Silicon Valley has hegemony over what’s innovative. Thus, the ubiquitous, and wrong, perspective that Bitcoin is mainly a technology that needs iterating, changes, governance by technocrats.</p><p>The Latin American perspective in this regard is refreshing. They already know that central bank monetary expansion is a big problem and see Bitcoin’s store of value property as a way to get out from under it. They’ve gone through huge currency devaluations and have learned already not to store value in their local currency. In other words, they have hard earned wisdom that Silicon Valley does not have.</p>Silicon Valley Arrogance♦<p>Money makes people think that they know more than they do and so does being technical. It’s a special form of the Dunning-Kruger effect that affects many technical people, but Silicon Valley especially. Wealth and prosperity blind them from entire categories of knowledge that only come in times of poverty.</p><p>The US hasn’t had to suffer much from its own monetary expansion the last 75 years as the world is on the dollar standard. It’s only when you look from outside the US, and particularly outside SF/NYC that you can see how much monetary expansion matters.</p>Bitcoin Really Fixes This<p>laBitConf has been going for 7 years, in part because of the obviousness of Bitcoin as a store of value. A lot of people have been able to avoid the crippling monetary expansion that’s been a constant reality in this region.</p><p>So why is it that so much of this gets ignored in the more prosperous countries? Mostly, it’s because they haven’t had to suffer from monetary expansion and therefore trust their central banks. There’s a perception that countries which suffer from currency devaluation do so through incompetence. They reason that such crazy devaluations would never happen in their own country. Little do they realize that central banks have had to do more and more for less and less effect.</p><p>In a sense, Bitcoin is a bet against central banks being able to keep the shell game up. The more you trust central bankers, the more you’ll dismiss Bitcoin’s store of value property and the more you’ll play up idiocies like Turing-complete smart contracts and blockchains-fix-everything.</p>♦

  Bitcoin by Ross #6: From the $20k Peak to Today<p>By Ross Ulbricht</p><p>The closer we get to the present in our analysis, the more uncertainty there is in where current prices fit into the larger Elliot Wave pattern (see here, here, here, here and here for context). The question posed in my last post was whether the all-time high of ~$20,000 in late 2017 was the end of intermediate wave (5) and thus primary wave ⑤ and cycle wave I, or whether it was just the end of intermediate wave (3).</p><p>These two scenarios have dramatically different implications for future prices, so we will look closely at how prices have progressed since the peak for clues as to which one is playing out. The difficulty is that we are in a large corrective pattern, which are notoriously tricky to analyze. The effort should be worthwhile though if we can identify some high-probability outcomes and specific points where our analysis will be negated or confirmed.</p>♦Fig. 1<p>Let’s look first at the scenario where the ~$20,000 peak is at the end of wave (3) (Fig. 1). This means that primary wave ⑤ (one degree higher) is still playing out and we should see prices move to new all-time highs (see here). Thus, the next major correction — the move down from ~$20,000 to ~$3,200 in late 2018 — is wave (4) (a three-wave correction) and the move up since then to above $13,000 is the beginning of wave (5). This wave count conforms to the Elliot Wave rules and guidelines (see here), but it does have one drawback: compared to previous corrective waves of intermediate degree, wave (4) is massive. In fact, it lasted longer and nearly as long as waves ② and ④ which are higher degree (see here), and it reduced prices by ~84%.</p><p>However, as we saw in my last post, all waves have been taking longer and longer to unfold, so perhaps wave (4)’s duration is not as dramatic as it seems. It is a correction of wave (3) after all, and wave (3) was massive too.</p><p>So, assuming we have labeled wave (4) correctly, is wave (5) unfolding as we would expect? So far it is, with two minor impulse waves (1 and 3) and two minor corrections (2 and 4), though it is too early to be sure of this count because these waves may be part of extensions. Regardless, a rise in price above the recent high over $13,000 would be a strong indication that our count is correct and the final push of cycle wave I is under way. A drop below the beginning of wave 2 (around $4,200) would invalidate the impulsive count of wave (5) because wave 4 cannot overlap wave 2 (see here).This would indicate a much greater likelihood that our second scenario is playing out.</p>♦Fig. 2<p>That scenario is that the ~$20,000 peak was the end of intermediate wave (5) and thus waves ⑤ and I (see Fig. 2). Cycle wave I is the entire move up from Bitcoin’s beginning, so if that is over, it means the price action since then is part of cycle wave II which will correct everything we have seen so far in Bitcoin. It will be the largest correction to date and will likely be accompanied by extreme pessimism for Bitcoin’s future.</p><p>If that is the case, the move down to $3,200 from ~$20,000 is wave Ⓐ, the first of the three waves in wave II, while the move from ~$3,200 to above $13,000 is best counted as Ⓑ, though it may be a little early to count Ⓑ as finished. Both divided into three subwaves. This is allowed in Elliot Wave as part of a pattern called a “flat.” The next major move then would be wave Ⓒ down unless something more complex is unfolding, which can happen in big corrections.</p><p>Regardless, prices will very likely fall below $3,200 and there is no hard limit to how low they can go (except $0 of course). The Elliot Wave guideline puts the price target in the range of the previous fourth wave of one less degree (i.e wave ④ of I), which had a price range between ~$175 and ~$1,200. We can’t say for sure because we have never seen a cycle-degree correction in Bitcoin, but past primary degree corrections (waves ② and ④ of I) ended above or near the top of their guideline range. So maybe wave II will also and won’t fall below $1,500 or so.</p><p>Whether we are in it now (our second scenario), or there is one more stab into new highs with wave (5) (our first scenario), wave II will come. As noted, it will likely be accompanied by extreme pessimism and antagonism toward Bitcoin. Long-time hodlers may capitulate and sell out. Businesses and governments may reject it. Some may call it “dead.” But so long as bitcoins are still being traded and the system remains technically sound, the end of wave II could be the best buying opportunity we will see for a very long time, perhaps ever again.</p><p>There is a third wave count that, while technically allowed, my gut tells me is not correct. This count puts the ~$20,000 peak as the end of wave I and the move down to ~$3,200 as the entirety of wave II. This wave II is puny and not commensurate with the spectacular drama of wave I. As amazing as the rise of wave I has been (Bitcoin’s history to date), I expect wave II to be equally shocking, though the negative emotions of fear, panic, pessimism and rejection will replace the euphoria and FOMO we have seen in wave I.</p>♦

  Bitcoin by Ross #5: End of a Cycle or Room to Run?<p>By Ross Ulbricht</p><p>We talked about the big picture of Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in value here, and a method of analyzing it called Elliot Wave here. See here and here also for context. Now we will zoom in on what appears to be the 5th and final primary wave of the first cycle wave up in Bitcoin’s price. We know where it began: at the end of the wave ④, at the major low in 2015 around $175. From there we see an exponential advance over nearly three years up to the current all-time high of ~$20,000 (see Fig. 1).</p>♦Fig. 1<p>This is the wave that got the most attention from the mainstream. By its end, Bitcoin was on everyone’s lips, and optimism about its prospects and future prices was bubbling over. It has since been in a corrective pattern for nearly two years.</p><p>There are several ways to interpret the structure of wave ⑤, each with different consequences. First though, let’s look at the move from the end of wave ④ to the ~$20,000 peak. It is difficult to count the intermediate and minor subwaves because there are so many that could qualify. I count no less than 15. Clearly there are extensions and extensions within extensions at play (we touched on extensions here). Luckily, we don’t have to know the correct count of wave ⑤’s subwaves in order to make some useful conclusions about it.</p><p>One thing we can be confident of is that the move up to $20,000 from the end of wave ④ is not intermediate wave (1) of ⑤. It is much too large for this, in both duration and price range, compared to previous intermediate waves. thus, if wave (1) of ⑤ ended before the ~$20,000 peak, so must wave (2) down. Wave (3) then must either take us to the peak or end short and waves (4) and (5) get us there.</p>♦Fig. 2<p>If the ~$20,000 peak is the end of wave (3), then the correction pattern we are in (or just came out of) is wave (4), and we can expect wave (5) to take us to new all-time highs (see Fig. 2). However, if the peak is the end of wave (5), it is also the end of primary wave ⑤, which is the end of cycle wave I. This interpretation means the correction we are in is the biggest we have seen in Bitcoin’s history, one that is correcting the entire move up from the beginning (see Fig. 3).</p>♦Fig. 3<p>There are three factors we need to recognize that will help us determine how much weight to give these two possible interpretations. The first two concern the size and shape of wave ⑤ compared to the two other impulse waves in wave I: waves ① and ③. The third concerns the wave structure since the ~$20,000 peak which I will save for my next post.</p><p>Let’s first look at the price ranges of waves ①, ③ and ⑤. Wave ① started at $0.06 and advanced to ~$32 for an increase of ~53,000%, or ~530x. Wave ③ started at ~$2 and advanced to ~$1,240 for an increase of ~620x. Wave ⑤ started at ~$175. If we count the ~$20,000 peak as the end of wave ⑤, that’s an increase of ~110x. This is enormous for virtually every other asset in history, but it is only a fraction of the moves of waves ① and ③. If the price move of wave ⑤ was on par with ① and ③ (530–620x), it would have to end around $93,000-$109,000. Thus, if our interpretation that wave ⑤ is not over, and the ~$20,000 peak was just wave (3) of ⑤, then a good target for the end of wave (5) of ⑤ of I is around $100,000 (See Fig. 4).</p>♦Fig. 4<p>Now let’s look at the durations of waves ①, ③ and ⑤. Wave ① began on ~10/1/2010 and lasted until 6/9/2011 for a total duration of ~251 days. Wave ③ began on 11/18/2011 and lasted until 11/29/2013 for a total duration of 742 days. Wave ⑤ began on 1/14/2015. If we count the ~$20,000 peak as the end of ⑤, then it lasted until 12/17/2017 for a total duration of 1,068 days.</p><p>From these three primary impulse waves, we see a pattern of increasing duration. The two primary corrective waves (② and ④) also show an increase in duration. In fact, a quick visual inspection of the total price history of Bitcoin on a log scale reveals an unmistakeable “stretched” look, with price fluctuations in general taking longer and longer to unfold (see Fig. 4).</p><p>A natural question could be, “what is the rate of this stretching?”, the answer to which would give us a time estimate for the end of wave ⑤ and thus wave I. If we compare the duration of wave ③ to the previous impulse (wave ①), we see that ③ lasted ~3x longer than ①. And if we compare the duration of wave ④ to the previous correction (wave ②) we see that ④ lasted ~2.5x longer than ②. If wave ⑤ is still unfolding and follows this pattern by being proportionally longer than the previous impulse (wave ③) by 2.5–3x, then it should last until sometime between 12/1/2019 - 2/17/2021 (see Fig. 4).</p><p>Thus, we have a price and target for the end of wave I of ~$100,000 some time in or near 2020. However, there is no rule that market moves have to be proportional. This is just a pattern we see unfolding that may or may not continue. I should also note that these estimates are based on readings of the price of a bitcoin in the distant past. The best I can find are not very precise. If you have more precise numbers, please post them in the comments with your source.</p><p>And if wave ⑤ is already over, then these targets are moot. We will look more closely in the next post at what has happened since the ~$20,000 peak to see if there are any clues as to whether the first cycle wave in Bitcoin is over or if there is another dramatic price increase on the horizon.</p>♦

  <p>By Ross Ulbricht</p><p>In case it isn’t abundantly clear yet, the overall trend in the price of bitcoins is up. Bitcoin started its rise from about $0.06 in late 2010 and peaked a couple of years ago at ~$20,000. Bitcoin is special in that we have its complete price history. We have a measure of its value as it went from nothing to something on its way to something big.</p><p>This fact is particularly helpful as we apply Elliot Wave analysis to this market. We have an absolute point of origin followed by a clear upward trend, so there is no question of context. What we see is not part of some unseen bigger picture. We have access to 100% of the price information (except future prices of course).</p>♦Fig. 1<p>What we see is a classic five-wave subdivision which I have labeled ①, ②, ③, ④ and ⑤ in Fig. 1. The circled numbers are Elliot Wave notation for primary degree waves. The labeling and naming is arbitrary, but this is the labeling typically used for waves of this duration in classic Elliot Wave analysis, so I have used it here. You will also notice an uppercase roman numeral “I” in Fig. 1. This is a label for the first wave of cycle degree (one above primary). It and wave ⑤ have questions marks next to them because we are unsure if where we placed the label is correct. (See here for a brief explanation of Elliot Wave, here for an explanation of our price charts, and here for context.)</p><p>Wave ①, the first primary wave up, has a clear five-wave subdivision, which is what we would expect from an impulse wave moving in the direction of the larger trend. These five “intermediate” waves are labeled in Fig. 2 as (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5).</p>♦Fig. 2<p>Wave ② is corrective (against the larger trend). Its intermediate subwaves are not clear (as is often the case with corrections), but overall it is a strong correction, erasing over 90% of the gains from wave ①.</p><p>Wave ③ does not have as clear a substructure as wave ①, but is definitely an impulse, taking the price from low single digits to over $1,000. Its impulsive subwaves also have the thrusting, exponential look of impulse waves. The tricky part here is determining exactly where one intermediate subwave ends and another begins. The way we have it labeled in Fig. 2, we have what’s called an “extended 3rd,” which is not uncommon as the 3rd wave is often the most powerful wave in an impulse. This makes intermediate waves (1) and (2) of ③ look small, compared to wave (3). Some of waves (3)’s “minor” subdivisions (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Fig. 2) are even bigger than waves (1) and (2). That’s ok. First and second waves are often this way because, as they unfold, the transition to an impulse has not been recognized, and there is still latent pessimism from the previous correction suppressing prices.</p><p>Finally, let’s look at wave ④. This is a classic “zig-zag” correction with a three-wave subdivision labeled (A), (B), (C) in Fig. 2.</p><p>Waves ① through ④ are complete, so the challenge we are faced with now is analyzing wave ⑤ when we are unsure if it has finished unfolding. Counting waves in hindsight is fairly straightforward. Counting them as they develop is much more challenging, but much more rewarding. A correct count before a wave is finished puts you in a position to predict future prices.</p><p>Click here for the next post.</p>♦

  <p>By Ross Ulbricht</p><p>Every week I have several Bitcoin charts sent in to the prison so I can do my analysis and stay up-to-date (see here for context). They take a few days to get to me and a few days to get back and put up online, so everything you see is at least a week out of date. This is fine though because we will only be looking at large movements in the market on the scale of months, years and even decades. My analysis should still be relevant regardless of what has happened while it’s in the mail, but I will be mindful of this limitation and make note of scenarios that could play out during that time just in case.</p><p>The charts we will be looking at show the price of a bitcoin in US dollars over time. (See Fig 1). We are looking at the price in dollars rather than euros or anything else because the highest volume of trade throughout Bitcoin’s history has been in dollars. Our method of analysis, Elliot Wave, is based on mass psychology (see here), so the bigger the market the better.</p>♦Fig. 1<p>The charts will be bar charts with the bars set close together. This display shows the full price range at every point, so we can determine if waves overlap (important for Elliot Wave), and it packs in relevant data. I will have to write wave labels and other notes on the charts by hand, but that will be part of the fun.</p><p>Finally, the charts will be in log scale. The vertical axis (the price) will increment by powers of ten (10, 100, 1000, etc…) rather than linearly (10, 20, 30, etc…). We do this because the log scale reveals movement in prices relevant to investors, and our thesis is that price movements are driven by the mass psychology of investors.</p><p>Let me illustrate with an example. Let’s say you bought $100 worth of bitcoins back when the price was $1. You would have ₿100. If you sold them at $18, you would have ₿1,800 (and you would be very sad today). Now let’s fast forward and the price is $1,000. Again you buy $100 worth, but this time you end up with only ₿0.1. If you sold this at $18,000, you would again have $1,800.</p><p>So the move from the $1 to $18 is just as significant as the move from $1,000 to $18,000 because an investor can make the same amount of money from it. On a log chart, these two moves are the exact same size vertically. On a linear chart, the $18 move would be dwarfed by the $18,000 move. You wouldn’t even see it. With the enormous price ranges Bitcoin has been through over the years, linear charts are practically useless for our purposes.</p><p>In the next post, we finally start seeing these charts with Elliot Wave analysis applied to them.</p>♦

  ♦<p>Bitcoin has come a long way over the past ten years. Relative to the first iteration of its software, the quality and reliability of current implementations has remarkably improved. Rapidly and organically, Bitcoin was able to lure a legion of developers to dedicate thousands of hours to improve, and at times revamp, most of its underlying codebase.</p><p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin is still the same. Much like a constitution, the core set of consensus rules that define its monetary properties, such as its algorithmic inflation and hard-coded supply, remain unchanged. Time and time again, factions have attempted to change these core properties, but all hostile takeovers thus far have failed. It’s often a painful process, but one that highlights and solidifies two of Bitcoin’s biggest virtues:</p><ol><li>No single party can dictate how Bitcoin evolves</li><li>The lack of centralized control protects Bitcoin’s monetary properties</li></ol><p>Interestingly, these are the rules that attract cypherpunks and institutional investors alike. These are the rules that make bitcoin an unprecedented type of money. However, these are also the rules that make developing software atop Bitcoin more challenging than any other digital asset. In essence, Bitcoin’s constitution awards developers a limited toolkit so that they can’t infringe upon its monetary policy. There’s too much at stake to move fast and break things.</p><p>That means innovation in Bitcoin requires creativity, patience, and perhaps most importantly, ego-minimization. After all, the fundamental rules embedded in Bitcoin’s constitution ultimately supersede technology. This is why Silicon Valley has had a hard time understanding Bitcoin’s value proposition, it’s not just a technology, financial instrument, or consumer application; it’s an entire monetary system supported by technology. Changing Bitcoin’s constitution requires a quasi-political process that can infringe upon its monetary properties, therefore, technological innovation is implemented as modules.</p><p>As often pointed out, Bitcoin’s modular approach to innovation is analogous to the evolution of the Internet’s protocol suite, whereby layers of different protocols specialized in specific functions. Emails were handled by SMTP, files by FTP, web pages by HTTP, user addressing by IP and packet routing by TCP. Over the years, each of these protocols evolved to provide the full experience you’re having this very second.</p><p>In Spencer Bogart’s excellent post on the emerging Bitcoin technology stack, he makes the case that we are now witnessing the beginning of Bitcoin’s own protocol suite. As it turned out, the inflexibility of Bitcoin’s core layer gave birth to several additional protocols that specialize in various applications, like Lightning’s BOLT standard for payment channels. Innovation is both vibrant and (relatively) safe, as this modular approach minimizes systemic monetary risks.</p><p>So much is happening at the many layers of Bitcoin’s technology stack, it can be incredibly difficult to keep track of emerging solutions. The diagram below is an attempt to map all relatively new initiatives and showcase a more complete picture of Bitcoin’s technology stack. It is not exhaustive, and it does not signal any endorsement for specific initiatives. It is, nevertheless, impressive to see that innovation is being pushed on all fronts; from layer 2 technologies, to emerging smart contract solutions:</p>♦Layer 2<p>There has been a lot of talk lately about the rate of adoption of the Lightning Network; Bitcoin’s most prominent layer 2 technology. Critics often point at an apparent decline in the number of channels and total BTC locked in Lightning; two metrics frequently used to evaluate user adoption. Although the community has converged on such metrics, it is important to point out that they are fundamentally flawed given the way Lightning works under the hood.</p><p>One of the most underrated virtues of the Lightning Network is its straightforward privacy properties. Since Lightning does not rely on global validation of all state changes (i.e. its own blockchain), users can transact privately over using additional techniques and network overlays, like Tor. At this point, we can estimate the percentage of private usage of the Lightning network by analyzing the number of channel opening transactions on-chain, and comparing that to the number of public channels off-chain. Christian Decker estimates that 41% of Lightning channels are private:</p>♦Source: Christian Decker<p>Activity happening within these channels is not captured by popular Lightning explorers. As such, an increase in private usage of Lightning results in a decrease in what can be publicly measured, leading observers to erroneously conclude that adoption is down. While it is true that Lightning must overcome substantial usability barriers before it can enjoy wide adoption, we must stop using misleading metrics to make assertions about the current state of the network. As Decker pointed out in his talk at the latest Lightning Conference in Berlin, even the above estimate of private vs. public channels is flawed, as the adoption of Schnorr signatures will make channel-opening transactions indistinguishable from regular transactions.</p><p>Another interesting recent development in the field of layer 2 privacy was the creation of WhatSat, a private messaging system atop Lightning. This project is a modification of the Lightning deamon which allows for relayers of private messages (the messengers that connect the entities communicating) to be compensated for their services via micropayments. This decentralized, censorship-and-spam-resistant chat was enabled by innovations in LND itself, such as recent improvements in the lightning-onion, Lightning’s own onion routing protocol.</p><p>The growth of Lapps, or Lightning Applications, demonstrate the wide applicability of these innovations when it comes to consumer applications, from a Lightning-powered cloud computing VPS to an image hosting service that shares ad revenue via microtransactions. And that’s just layer 2 innovation within Lightning. More generally, we define Layer 2 as a suite of applications that use Bitcoin’s base layer as a court where exogenous events are reconciled and disputes are settled. As such, the theme of data anchoring on Bitcoin’s blockchain is much broader, with companies like Microsoft pioneering a decentralized ID system atop Bitcoin. Such initiatives increase the demand for on-chain reconciliation and are instrumental for the long-term development of a Bitcoin fee market.</p>Smart Contracts<p>There are also a number of projects attempting to bring back expressive smart contract functionality to Bitcoin in a safe and responsible way. This is a significant development, because starting in 2010, several of the original Bitcoin opcodes (the operations that determine what Bitcoin is able to compute) were removed from the protocol. This came after a series of terrifying bugs were unveiled, which led Satoshi himself to disable some of the functionality of Script, Bitcoin’s programming language.</p><p>Over the years, it became crystal clear that there are non-trivial security risks that accompany highly-expressive smart contract functionality. The common rule of thumb is that the more functionality is introduced to a virtual machine (the collective verification mechanism that processes opcodes), the more unpredictable its programs will be. More recently, however, we have seen new approaches to smart contract architecture in Bitcoin that can minimize unpredictability, but also provide vast functionality.</p><p>The devise of a new approach to Bitcoin smart contracts called Merkleized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) has ignited a new wave of supporting technologies that attempt to optimize the trade-offs between security and functionality. Most prominently is Taproot, an elegant implementation of the MAST structure that enables an entire application to be expressed as a Merkle Tree, whereby each branch of the tree represents a different execution outcome. Along with Taproot will come a programming language called Tapscript, which can be used to more easily express the spend conditions associated with each branch of the Merkle Tree.</p><p>Another interesting innovation that has recently resurfaced is a new architecture for the implementation of covenants, or spend conditions, on Bitcoin transactions. Originally proposed as a thought experiment by Greg Maxwell back in 2013, covenants are an approach to limit the way balances can be spent, even as their custody changes. Although the idea has existed for nearly seven years, covenants were impractical to be implemented before the advent of Taproot. Now, a new opcode called OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY (formerly known as OP_SECURETHEBAG) is leveraging this new technology to potentially enable covenants to be safely implemented in Bitcoin.</p><p>At first glance, covenants are incredibly useful in the context of lending (and perhaps bitcoin-based derivatives) as they enable the creation of policies like clawbacks to be attached to specific BTC balances. But their potential impact on the usability of Bitcoin goes vastly beyond lending. Covenants can allow for the implementation of things like Bitcoin Vaults, which, in the context of custody, provide the equivalent of a second private key that allows a party that has been hacked to “freeze” stolen funds. There are so many other applications of this technology, like Non-Interactive Payment Channels, Congestion Controlled Transactions, CoinJoins, it truly deserves a standalone post. For more on this, check out Jeremy Rubin’s BIP draft.</p><p>It is important to note that Schnorr signatures are the technological primitive that make all of these new approaches to smart contracts possible. After Schnorr activates, even edgier techniques being can be theorized, such as Scriptless Scripts, which could enable fully private and scalable Bitcoin smart contracts to be represented as digital signatures (as opposed to opcodes). Similarly, Discreet Log Contracts also employ the idea of representing a smart contract’s execution outcome as a digital signature for better privacy and scalability. Together, these new approaches may enable novel smart contract applications to be built atop Bitcoin and Schnorr is the basis of it.</p>Mining<p>There have also been some interesting developments in mining protocols, especially those used by mining pool constituents. Even though the issue of centralization in Bitcoin mining is often wildly exaggerated, it is true that there are power structures retained by mining pool operators that can be further decentralized. Namely, pool operators can decide which transactions will be mined by all pool constituents, which grants them considerable power. Over time, some operators have abused this power by censoring transactions, mining empty blocks and reallocating hashing output to other networks without the authorization of constituents.</p><p>Thankfully, there are technologies that are attempting to flip that power structure upside down. One of the most substantial changes coming to Bitcoin mining is the second version of Stratum, the most popular protocol used in mining pools. Stratum V2 is a complete overhaul that implements BetterHash, a secondary protocol that enables mining pool constituents to decide the composition of the block they will mine and not the other way around. Stratum V2 also implements several optimizations, and allows mining pool constituents to better communicate and coordinate.</p><p>Another interesting development in the mining industry that should contribute to more stability is reignited interest in hashrate and difficulty derivatives. These can be particularly useful for mining operations that wish to hedge against hashrate fluctuations and difficulty readjustments. While these derivatives have yet to be productized, this marks an interesting evolution in the industrialization of Bitcoin mining.</p>Privacy<p>After our report on Schnorr signatures, some privacy-coin advocates were outraged by the suggestion that sufficient privacy may be optionally achieved in Bitcoin at some point. Although this suggestion may challenge theses around the long-term value proposition of privacy assets, there are a host of emerging protocols that can bring better privacy into Bitcoin. Although it is likely that privacy in Bitcoin will continue to be more of an art than a science, there have been interesting innovations on this front that are worth highlighting.</p><p>Before we delve into specific privacy innovations, it’s important to highlight that the biggest impediment to private transactions across digital assets is the fact that most solutions are half-baked. Privacy assets that focus on transaction-graph privacy often neglect network-level privacy, and vice versa. Both vectors suffer from a lack of maturity and usage, which makes transactions easier to de-anonymize via statistical traceability analysis at either the P2P network layer or the blockchain layer.</p>♦<p>Thankfully, there are several projects pushing boundaries on both fronts.</p><p>When it comes to transaction-graph privacy, solutions like P2EP and CheckTemplateVerify are interesting because privacy becomes a by-product of efficiency. As novel approaches to CoinJoin, these solutions can increase the adoption of private transactions by users that are solely motivated by lower transaction fees. Although privacy guarantees are still suboptimal under a CoinJoin model, unshielded sent amounts can still be beneficial, as they preserve the auditability of Bitcoin’s supply and free float.</p><p>If lower transaction fees become a motivator and lead to an increase in Bitcoin’s anonymity set (the % of UTXOs that are CoinJoin outputs), de-anonymization via statistical clustering analysis will become even more subjective than it already is. Some blockchain analysis companies have been able to trick law enforcement agencies into believing an assigned probability that a UTXO belongs to a specific user, but the underlying model is already extremely nuanced and fragile. If the majority of UTXOs become CoinJoin outputs, that might break existing approaches to clustering.</p><p>Before that can happen, there’s a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done on the usability front so that all Bitcoin users, tech savy or not, have equal access to privacy mechanisms. Beyond P2EP and CheckTemplateVerify, a recent development in usability was the proposal of SNICKER (Simple Non-Interactive CoinJoin with Keys for Encryption Reused), a novel way to generate CoinJoins with untrusted peers. SNICKER combines several technologies to grant users access to CoinJoin transactions without having to trust or interact with their peers.</p><p>Progress is also noticeable in protocols that aim to improve the privacy and efficiency of P2P communications. Over the course of 2019, the privacy-preserving network protocol Dandelion was successfully tested across multiple cryptonetworks. Even though privacy in transaction propagation is not a silver bullet when it comes to the full spectrum of P2P communication, protocols like Dandelion can still meaningfully increase user privacy by hiding the originating IP address of a nodes broadcasting a transaction.</p><p>A final development in Bitcoin’s networking stack worth highlighting is a new transaction relay protocol called Erlay. Although still at a very early development stage, Erlay is an important innovation because it can considerably reduce the bandwidth requirements of running a Bitcoin full node. If implemented, Erlay’s efficiency gains can enable users to participate in transaction relay, which is bandwidth intensive, and continuously validate the chain, especially in countries where Internet Service Providers impose caps on bandwidth.</p>The Tip of the Iceberg<p>It is incredibly difficult to track all the innovation happening in Bitcoin, and this post is just a scratch on the surface. This brings us to the key takeaway of this piece: Bitcoin, in its totality, is a constantly evolving suite of protocols. The modular approach to innovation described here is important, as it plays a key role in minimizing politicism in the evolution of Bitcoin and protects its fundamental monetary properties.

  <p>José is a bitcoiner. Like many others, he discovered bitcoin a couple of
years ago and is fascinated by the technology. Unlike many others,
however, José lives in a country where the traditional financial system
ceased to work: Venezuela.</p>

<p>“It’s almost as if Venezuela was what Satoshi had in mind when he
invented bitcoin over a decade ago,” José mused when I talked to him. “A
laboratory to test his ideas, if you will.”</p>

<p>A lot of people in Venezuela, as elsewhere, dismiss bitcoin as just
another speculative asset. “They don’t understand the nature of this
very different beast.”</p>

<p>José was lucky enough to understand the nature of this beast earlier
than most. And he was lucky enough to earn some extra income, which
allowed him to invest a bit of money in bitcoin.</p>

<p>He is well educated and has a day job which would earn him thousands of
dollars in most other countries. In Venezuela, he is earning
approximately $7 a month. Due to the failure of the monetary system in
his country, José is working for free, essentially.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Living in Venezuela gives you a certain advantage in understanding
how fiat money is essentially broken — we have the worst fiat money in
the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin plays an interesting role in Venezuela. On the one hand, some
people use it to store their wealth and protect themselves from
hyperinflation. On the other hand, people use it as a borderless payment
system.</p>

<p>“A lot of people in Venezuela survive solely through remittances of
money sent from family abroad,” reports José.</p>

<p>While many people are receiving and earning money in bitcoin, others
choose to mine bitcoin — if the circumstances allow it.</p>

<p>“You would be surprised how many people have underground mining rigs
here,” José tells me. “Maybe that is part of the reason why we have had
blackouts nationwide,” he says half-jokingly. “Pretty crazy shit, eh?”</p>

<p>Pretty crazy shit indeed.</p>

<p>I asked him if he is worried about his personal safety, and if there are
any crackdowns on bitcoiners in Venezuela. “I think the government has
other priorities to worry about,” was his response.</p>

<p>The current situation in Venezuela leads to some interesting problems.
Let’s say you are running an international business, and you have bank
accounts in different countries. If you want to cash out, you would have
to transfer your money to a Venezuelan bank, which would only allow you
to withdraw in Bolivares, which are essentially worthless.</p>

<p>The reason for this restriction is, of course, government intervention.
People are not allowed to withdraw and hold other currencies. They are
forced to use the worthless Venezuelan bolívar, which continues to lose
90% of its purchasing power in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>People are starting to catch on to the idea that Bitcoin can actually
fix some of the problems that the Venezuelan people are facing. “My
friend came to me because he knows I am ‘the bitcoin guy’ and was
wondering if Bitcoin could fix this.”</p>

<p>Bitcoin could indeed fix this, but with the current stance of the
government, the use of bitcoin is pushed underground.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“BTC does not seem like something Maduro would want to have widespread
adoption in Venezuela. Because it means giving people economic
freedom.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, it seems, the government is not interested in providing this
freedom. It seems that the Venezuelan government is interested in
economical oppression and control, and not the opposite.</p>

<p>However, José thinks there might be reasons for optimism: “Given the
economic chaos and free-for-all that a Venezuela with a failed state
has, Maduro has to back down on socialist reform and allow for free
and open markets to operate.”</p>

<p>Such free and open markets could be powered by Bitcoin, which is free
and open by nature. It is, however, still too complicated to be adopted
by the masses. José hopes that future development will lead to more ease
of use, and more intuitive interfaces. One such interface could be an
SMS wallet — denominated in bolivares and sats — that uses LocalBitcoins
under the hood.</p>

<p>Speaking of LocalBitcoins: Even with the recent compliance with KYC and
AML regulations, which arguably make the use more cumbersome,
LocalBitcoins remains one of the most popular ways to buy and sell
bitcoin in Venezuela. Bisq would be a decentralized option, but for the
time being it lacks support for payment methods used in Venezuela. And
the volume is simply too low.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen any Akira Kurosawa movie?” José asks. “There is one
called Dersu Uzala, about a Russian exploration in Siberia and a local
guide named Dersu Uzala.”</p>

<p>José sends me a link to the scene and
explains what is happening: the leader of the expedition, Captain
Arsenyev, and Dersu are caught in the Russian tundra as nightfall is
approaching. Dersu, being a local nomadic hunter, starts hectically
gathering bushels of grass to build a shelter before the brutal cold of
the night hits them with full force. “That’s an apt metaphor of my
situation and how I see the future collapse of fiat money and central
banking,” José tells me. “I am frantically scraping up satoshis because
I, too, don’t want to be caught in the open steppes by nightfall.”</p>

<p>A couple of weeks after we first talked, José reached out to me to let
me know that he has found an even better way to collect his bushels:
earning bitcoin. He managed to land a job online and is now earning more
per hour than he was earning per month doing his regular job.</p>

<p>Coming from a first world country, it is easy to forget that Bitcoin has
the power to completely change people’s lives. Bitcoin changed José’s
life, and it will continue to change the lives of people in dire
circumstances as nightfall approaches. Let’s just hope that it will be a
short night and that enough people realize that bushels of grass can
build a shelter. Or, in José’s words: “Buy cheap satoshis while you
still can. And hodl on!”</p>

  <p>I’m a markets junkie. A markets junkie is somebody who is physically dependent on watching asset prices tick up and down, constantly trying to analyze the cause and effect of every movement across the globe. Naturally, when I first understood the true nature of the Bitcoin protocol, I became obsessed with its price as well.</p>Rabbit holes<p>I began my dive down the Bitcoin rabbit hole in 2016. I was trading US Treasuries and other interest rate products for an institutional asset manager, my first big trading gig. I had unprecedented access to some of the most brilliant minds on Wall Street for the first time in my life, so it’s safe to say I began my dive down the banking rabbit hole in 2016 as well.</p><p>The craziest thing about going down the Bitcoin and banking rabbit holes at the same time is the difference in scale; it’s unimaginable. At the time, Bitcoin had less than $20 billion in total value. I, a relatively small player in the bond market, was turning over $20 billion in Treasuries in just a few months. One seemed way too small, and the other way too large. I knew I had to learn to start thinking in trillions if I was to understand the scale of the global financial system.</p>♦The numbers game<p>I’ll never forget the moment I conquered the concept of trillions. My fellow trader and close friend played a daily numbers game with us on the trading desk. This time, the question was, “How much money settled via the Federal Reserve’s wire system last year?” I thought for a minute, did some mental math, and guessed “Three quarters of a quadrillion.” The answer, sure enough, was $767 trillion. I was off by a gargantuan $17 trillion, but somehow that amount was both less than 3% margin of error and a thousand times the size of Bitcoin. Bitcoin was simply too small, at less than $20 billion, and the dollar system had enough zeros to make one’s head spin. The two would reconcile over the coming decade or two, I had decided, and I should be spending my time on the Bitcoin side. I started thinking about life after the trading desk, knowing it would probably involve Bitcoin.</p>♦Bitcoin is digital gold<p>I watched Treasuries, equities, gold, oil, currencies, and tried to understand how they all worked together. I saw Bitcoin assuming the role of gold as sound money role in a digital future. The supply schedule and difficulty adjustment game theory hooked me in. I started digging and immediately found the conversation focusing on an update called SegWit, which would allow for something called the Lightning Network.</p><p>The first time I used Bitcoin, I tracked the transaction’s status on a block explorer. Right away, I became intimately aware of the settlement process of Bitcoin; it was thrilling. Of course the first block took over half an hour, and my heart was (quite unnecessarily) panicking. Basically, the finality of settlement after a couple blocks felt incredibly secure, but the hour that it took was completely impractical for any sort of daily routine transaction. It was clear to me that Bitcoin was digital gold, and instead of taking weeks on ships across oceans to settle, it takes about an hour. Incredibly powerful, empowering, and in fact revolutionary. But not a global “currency.”</p>♦Lightning Network makes Bitcoin a global currency<p>Lightning Network changed Bitcoin forever with instant settlement. In the Lightning Network, settlement is free from the time burden of block confirmations. Lightning’s architecture consists of instantly settling financial agreements, secured by a call option, or a justice transaction. Lightning Network massively expands the velocity of Bitcoin, increases Bitcoin’s capacity for transactions by orders of magnitude, and most importantly, began a new wave of Bitcoin innovation.</p><p>The very concept of “streaming money” has software developers buzzing with energy, and I’m blown away by some of the use cases they’re coming up with. Bitcoin’s supply schedule initially hooked me, but Lightning was the force that was pulling me in. I decided to dedicate my intellectual capacity to Bitcoin’s Lightning Network because a store-of-value asset exhibiting medium-of-exchange currency speed and scale is unprecedented in human history, and worth pursuit.</p>♦I took the jump, now I’m along for the ride<p>After years of trading bonds and leading a dual life of rates trader and Bitcoin fanatic, it was time to make the transition full time to Bitcoin. The community graciously welcomed me and my idea of the Lightning Network Reference Rate in 2018, but it wasn’t until earlier this year that I met the team from OpenNode in downtown Los Angeles, only a few blocks from where I traded Treasuries. The chemistry was instant because the vision was precisely aligned: a full conviction in Lightning Network and its role in bringing Bitcoin to the world.</p><p>My message to them was clear: I wanted to help onboard the world to the proverbial LNP/BP (Lightning Network Protocol / Bitcoin Protocol) stack, a la the ubiquitous TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) stack upon which the world’s internet infrastructure is built. To my delight, they wanted me along for the ride.</p>♦Lightning is just beginning<p>The pace of Lightning innovation since its debut early last year has been staggering. I laugh when I hear skeptics say that Lightning Network capacity and growth has stalled because of arbitrary public channel metrics. Lightning Network is not a public ledger like Bitcoin. It’s actually quite the private ledger, making so-called chain analysis irrelevant within Lightning. Any attempts to analyze the growth of Lightning Network from the outside are futile.</p><p>Additionally, the narrative I hear in the financial media about Bitcoin as merely digital gold is frankly a little tired. These people either haven’t technically understood the Lightning Network or aren’t aware of its existence. Bitcoin now works at light speed, something that a precious, and very heavy, metal could never do.</p>♦OpenNode is carrying the torch<p>At OpenNode, we don’t have to guess whether Bitcoin is a store of value or a medium of exchange. We know it’s both, and we know that both functions are essential to Bitcoin’s build. The vast majority of transactions we process is via the Lightning Network, but the vast majority of value we process is on-chain. We also don’t have to guess whether people want to use a hosted solution. When I asked our CEO and co-founder Afnan Rahman his biggest surprise since starting OpenNode, he said “I’m surprised by how quickly we’ve gained trust from the community, even amongst some of the hardcore bitcoiners, who shall not be named.”</p><p>Now that our Blog is up and running, we’re excited about our next endeavor: OpenNode Research. Our first report, to be released in Q1 2020, will tackle the world of Bitcoin as a transactional currency. Global e-commerce will surpass $4 trillion by next year, and our mission is to determine exactly how much of that we can power at OpenNode. The task at hand is challenging to say the least, but the challenge motivates us to debunk one of Bitcoin’s greatest misconceptions — that it is only a store of value and not a medium of exchange. It’s both, and we’re excited to show you why.</p>♦

  Bitcoin is a minimalist philosophy.♦<p>Bitcoin Minimalism is a lifestyle that helps people question what things add value to their lives. An article by Conner Brown and myself, with other Bitcoiners providing input.</p>Create more, consume less<p>Bitcoin reduces your time preference and enables you to look long-term at saving and investing. It’s not about consuming, it’s about saving and investing that makes our world a great place.</p><p>By consuming less, you allow others to access good and services more cheaply currently. It’s a way to escape the excesses of the world around us — the excesses of consumerism, material possessions, clutter, too much debt, too many distractions, too much noise.</p>Discover purpose in our lives<p>Bitcoin Minimalism is about finding truth in yourself and your beliefs rather than in material possessions. Freedom from the trappings of the consumer culture we’ve built our lives around which has been fueled by Keynesian economic policies.</p><p>Bitcoin minimalism is about making decisions more consciously, more deliberately… a flight to quality. Clearing away all of the frivolous arguments and only focusing on what matters. In stark contrast to the ICO bubble in which consuming, waste, and fraud were prevalent.</p><p>Minimalists search for happiness not through things, but through life itself; thus, it’s up to you to determine what is necessary and what is superfluous in your life. The pursuit of knowledge through Bitcoin Minimalism is about better understanding the world around you.</p>Minimum Viable Product<p>Building a product is about fighting the insidious disease of more. Bitcoin’s community and core dev team have focused on being the most efficient, or minimal, they can be in regards to building Bitcoin.</p><p>Developers: Working with one chain reduces mental bandwidth for developers. Working with many is a near impossible task.</p><p>Security: Using just one Blockchain enhances the security of the ecosystem through more rigorous exploit analysis and PoW building the “largest” wall (instead of hundreds of little walls)</p><p>Code: Satoshi chose a non-turing complete language so that it can provide predictable outcomes and facilitate trust minimization. Adding more complex loops creates unpredictable scenarios (DAO, parity) that requires you to trust the script without knowing the outcomes.</p><p>Scalability: Bitcoin is about being hyper-efficient with Layer 1 (Schnorr/Segwit) while also pushing innovation on Layer 2 (Lightning) which is an exponentially more scalable solution, thereby enabling Bitcoin to be more usable by the masses. We want to maximize the value/byte transfer. While we could easily increase the block size, it would the least efficient way to scale. And being efficient with our limited block size is the utmost importance as it enables us to become decentralized/censorship resistant.</p><p>Economics: By rebuilding the capital markets stack from a sound money base, we can then be confident that our foundation is structurally secure.</p>Bitcoin Minimalism is rooted in libertarian philosophy<p>Libertarian political philosophy follows the idea of minimal government intervention and respect for the sovereignty of the individual. As Thoreau said, “Government is best which governs least.”</p><p>A government should be a minimalist system that protects individuals from threat of violence or coercion, enforces contract and property rights, and reasonably provides for the national defense.</p><p>By separating the monopoly on money from the state, we are guaranteed that any seizure of wealth must be through direct taxation rather than through silent inflation or deficit spending.</p><p>Those who opt-in to Bitcoin, are trading something abundant for something scarce, trading the past for the future, trading financial dependence for financial sovereignty.</p>♦

  <p>Bitcoin has value because it’s decentralized digital money. It has a stock/flow ratio that continues to increase and a scarcity enforced by a highly credible monetary policy that no physical asset can ever have. In addition, Bitcoin has a huge network which has made it the Schelling Point, security that’s extremely expensive to subvert and a history that no crypto asset can match. Some nascent research has suggested that stock to flow is a fundamental measure of value for Bitcoin, which makes sense as Bitcoin is really decentralized.</p><p>Altcoins are a different story. They all lack the one major innovation that Bitcoin has: decentralization. This means that altcoins are fundamentally different from Bitcoin and are closer to fiat money. Their central points of failure can and have been used by outside parties to influence or even control. Centralization is why the stock to flow model does not work at all for altcoins but does so for Bitcoin. So what gives altcoins value? Why do altcoins have any price?</p>♦<p>In this article, I hope to explore this very question. Do altcoins add valuable new technical features? Are their buyers hoping for a path towards decentralization? What made Litecoin successful while its earlier, very similar cousin Fairbrix fail? Why did coins with a large premine like IxCoin fail while one like Ethereum succeed? To what can we attribute these relative successes and failures?</p>The Myth of Technical Innovation<p>Talk to any altcoin holder and they will inevitably argue that their coin is the one with the most interesting features. They argue that their coin will revolutionize some industry by doing something that will make the tokens worth more, usually through some convoluted set of hand-wavy incentives. The hope, of course, is that their coin will be “the next Bitcoin” as a result of some new feature and become the new Schelling Point for a global currency.</p>♦<p>This is little more than wishful thinking as any holder of previous pretenders to the throne can tell you. From Feathercoin to Auroracoin to Steem, there have been many coins that offered some supposed technical advantage but failed to maintain traction, let alone dethrone Bitcoin.</p><p>The technical features include stuff like faster block times, proof-of-something other than work, change of hashing algorithms, change in monetary policy, expansion of block size, promises of privacy, a utility for a particular service, solving some problem in some specific industry and so on.</p><p>All of these are at best wishful thinking as their community is limited to the demoralized and/or deluded token holders that continue to hope for a miraculous Bitcoin dethronement. The technical merits of the “innovations” are often found severely wanting (Turing complete smart contracts), if not outright fraudulent (Bitconnect), but even the few that have some merit are so hopelessly lost in a quagmire of badly designed incentives that they solve no real world problems.</p><p>All that is to say that technical innovation in altcoins is almost always a complete miss. Real innovation finds a market. These altcoins haven’t found any real users for their stated goal and very few have managed to have any volume of any kind whatsoever.</p>♦<p>As most altcoins are open source, forking the coin and changing a few parameters to create a technical clone is quite simple. If technology or features were the basis of value, technical clones would have significant value. Such clones don’t, so this indicates technical features are not the reason for their value.</p><p>No, what separates the valuable altcoins from the valueless is not technical improvements at all, but something else.</p>The Story of Litecoin and Fairbrix<p>The story of altcoin valuation starts here because Fairbrix and Litecoin are two very similar coins. They have the same proof-of-work, a similar launch date (2011) and the same creator: Charlie Lee.</p><p>Both of these coins were based off of Tenebrix, which was an altcoin launched in 2011 using a then-new proof-of-work algorithm, Scrypt and a slightly faster block time versus Bitcoin’s 10 minutes. The community at the time objected to Tenebrix because of a large premine, leading Charlie Lee to fork Tenebrix to create Fairbrix. Much like how Zclassic would fork Zcash much later, Fairbrix was a clone of Tenebrix without the premine.</p>♦<p>Of course, Fairbrix went nowhere and therein was the brilliance of Charlie Lee’s strategy. He took the same features and created another coin, Litecoin and branded it better. He changed the block time from 5 minutes to 2.5 minutes and worked out a few bugs and gave the coin much better marketing. His most keen insight as he would say to many people over the years, is that he gave Litecoin a catchy slogan: Silver to Bitcoin’s gold.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, this was a minimal set of new features. The one major change in the coin is the change in the proof-of-work algorithm which was copied from Tenebrix. The effort into integrating Scrypt was not exactly great engineering. For example, the block hashes in Litecoin are indistinguishable from transaction hashes. This is not the case in Bitcoin as block hashes all start with a bunch of 0-bytes, making block hashes obvious. Likewise, none of the small design errors in Bitcoin, like the OP_CHECKMULTISIG off by one bug or the 4-byte timestamp were corrected. Litecoin was essentially a clone with a few minor tweaks and good marketing.</p><p>There were a lot of coins created in the 2011 era that haven’t really survived, including IxCoin, SolidCoin, Geistgeld and Litecoin’s brother Fairbrix and father Tenebrix. The marketing deathblow for some would be a premine, which many in the community would condemn, but as Fairbrix shows, the lack of a premine didn’t guarantee an altcoin’s success, either. What made Litecoin popular was its clever marketing and technical features had very little to do with its success.</p><p>So why did these coins show up when they did? Mid-2011 was the first major Bitcoin bubble, going from less than $1 earlier in the year to $30 by July. All of the above-mentioned coins came shortly after the bubble popped starting in August. Many call this the “Scambrian explosion” of 2011. Given that all these coins started shortly after the bubble, there would seem to be at least some correlation. We would see similar Scambrian explosions in the subsequent bubbles of 2013 and 2017.</p>Mastercoin vs. Counterparty vs. Ethereum<p>Fast forward to 2013 and we can see another group of altcoins entering the picture. Mastercoin launched that summer, followed by Counterparty a few months later and the Ethereum presale in early 2014. All three were after the same mantle, that of a platform for launching new tokens. Mastercoin was dubiously the first to do a token presale before any product was built, or what we would today call an ICO. Mastercoin’s presale followed shortly after the April 2013 bubble during the summer of 2013. The token would languish for years until the 2017 pump.</p>♦<p>Counterparty was a response to Mastercoin, requiring Bitcoins to be burned instead of donated. Bitcoins had to be sent to an address which would require breaking some cryptography to redeem in order to get XCP tokens. Counterparty launched a few months after Mastercoin in 2013.</p><p>Of particular interest was the fact that after Ethereum’s ICO in 2014, all of the supposed new technical capabilities of Ethereum (the capabilities of the Solidity language) were added to Counterparty. Ethereum responded by showing that the Counterparty smart contract platform could just as easily be done on Ethereum. In essence, the two coins were feature-for-feature at the same level.</p><p>What made Ethereum much more successful than either Mastercoin or Counterparty was the unprecedented amount of marketing that went into the token sale. Not only was the ICO amount far larger than any previous one (30,000 BTC), but the premine that they had was sold to the public as a good thing, as a way to fund continuing development and marketing. As Vitalik has said, he made premines acceptable in a way that the 2011 batch of coins did not.</p>♦I’m not sure what universe Vitalik is in, but where I’m from, 67% is not “small”<p>The marketing driving the ETH presale dwarfed that of any other coin coming before and as a result, despite a lot of similarities in feature sets to Counterparty, Ethereum was able to succeed in the 2017 bull market in a way that the other tokens did not.</p><p>To say that this looked crazy to any rational investor at the time Ethereum launched is to understate the case. The complete lack of investor protections in their token sale and the ridiculous 72M premine made, for many, ETH dead in the water. In addition, there were several high-profile delays in launching as well as funding problems during the year and a half they spent building Ethereum.</p><p>Technically speaking, there are so many shortcomings in Ethereum that they’re planning to scrap the entire infrastructure for Ethereum 2.0! There have been numerous documented problems from the DAO to the Parity Bug to the fact that ETH addresses lack a checksum. Yet all of these problems have essentially been ignored by the market. The technical realities of Ethereum do not seem to matter to the investors.</p><p>In other words, Ethereum was able to overcome all of those problems with what can only be described as insanely effective marketing. In a sense, Ethereum is the precedent for all the different coins that have raised billions without any code or investor protections. They’ve also shown that even hopelessly insecure systems can thrive with enough marketing. When it comes to altcoins, marketing overcomes all.</p>The Curious Case of Ripple<p>XRP was the first token to be entirely premined and launched in 2012. Interestingly, the token languished in the sub-billion market cap range all the way until 2017, when it rode the wave of the Bitcoin bull market to a cool $127 billion market cap at its peak. Somehow, XRP wasn’t a part of the April 2013 or November 2013 bubbles and yet burst through during the 2017 one.</p><p>So what changed? How was an asset that was languishing for a good 5 years suddenly so popular? There seem to be several reasons, with more effective marketing during the bull run being one and the low unit price being the other.</p><p>The main marketing message for Ripple was always that they would be a coin that’s for corporations and big institutions. It’s an excellent marketing story as no other coin at the time of its creation claimed that mantle.</p>♦<p>In addition, there appeared on Twitter the XRP Army in 2017 which relentlessly promoted the coin. Ripple Labs also sent out many press releases which, even when unrelated to XRP, caused the price of the token to go up. Having a corporation at the center seems to have aided the marketing efforts of XRP as it was much easier to send out press releases and throw parties and so on that would bring publicity.</p><p>In other words, by 2017, Ripple Labs stepped up their marketing game by leveraging its advantages as a corporation.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, Ripple is extremely centralized with software that calls home to upgrade and no way to resolve differences between different database states. Yet the marketing of Ripple and the XRP army obscure this on a daily basis. Technical reality and marketing, it seems, don’t need any alignment whatsoever.</p><p>Other altcoins since then have gone even further, creating or promising to create ecosystems in exchange for fully premined tokens. These tokens amount to gift cards to a store that has yet to be built and has no products or services yet with vague promises of opening at some point in the future.</p>BCH and BSV vs other BTC hard forks<p>2017 brought on another class of altcoins, which gave an airdrop to Bitcoin holders. BCH was the very first hard fork coin, but it did not stop there. 2017–2018 brought a lot more hard forks like Bitcoin Gold, Lightning Bitcoin, Bitcoin Private and many others which have not fared nearly as well. This is despite many of these coins having better technical features. Bitcoin Private, for example, inherited Zclassic’s shielded transactions (which in turn came from ZCash). Lightning Bitcoin has guaranteed 1 minute block times. Bitcoin Clean uses less energy and Bitcoin Interest gives owners staking income.</p>♦<p>Why did these coins fail in comparison to BCH? What appealed about BCH was not the technical differences, like larger blocks or a lack of Segwit, but the marketing capabilities of people like Roger Ver, Calvin Ayre and Jihan Wu. Roger Ver uses the bitcoin.com domain to mislead people into thinking BCH is Bitcoin and Jihan Wu at one point forced customers of the popular Antminer series of Bitcoin miners to pay in BCH.</p><blockquote>“I made bitcoin what it is today, and I’ll do it again with Bitcoin Cash” — Roger Ver</blockquote><p>Though utterly wrong about his influence on BTC, Roger Ver has the correct assessment of his role in BCH. Marketing has given BCH a huge advantage over the other hard fork coins. Roger Ver has spent a good deal of money sponsoring many conferences to promote BCH and bitcoin.com in 2018 (this has largely stopped in 2019).</p><p>The split between BCH and BSV is another precautionary tale as the market cap before the split was higher than the combined total after the split. The split in marketing efforts reduced the overall effectiveness leading to a lower combined market cap. Calvin Ayre and Craig Wright apparently had some marketing value for BCH which was lost to BSV.</p><p>Technically speaking, BCH has had a lot of documented problems and continues to put out dubious features. Note as with Litecoin, a lot of the design errors from Bitcoin like the OP_CHECKMULTISIG off-by-one bug or a 4-byte timestamp in the blockheader are not fixed, despite ample opportunity in the numerous hard forks since August 1, 2017 to do so.</p><p>Again, none of this seems to matter to the BCH holders. Marketing trumps all.</p>Why Altcoin Marketing Works<p>Marketing in crypto has a virtuous feedback cycle as anyone that buys a token tends to market the token to other people via word-of-mouth much more than any other product. The incentives are such that holders of a particular token do a lot of additional marketing for the coin, essentially for free. Altcoin creators euphemistically call such people their “community” which help promote the coin without any cost to the altcoin marketers. As such, the marketing money spent on altcoins has had out-sized returns.</p>♦<p>Thus, the biggest factor for a large altcoin valuation is effective marketing and to a lesser degree the coordination of such efforts. Ironically, the more centralized an altcoin is, the better it tends to do. It’s not a coincidence that Ethereum and Ripple are the second and third biggest by market cap. They have strong centralized teams, one a foundation, the other a corporation that excel at effective marketing. BCH, which is fourth by market cap as of this writing, also has that same marketing centralization around Roger Ver, who owns the very valuable bitcoin.com domain.</p><p>Altcoins that aren’t good at marketing tend to do worse over time, even if they have strong technical teams. This includes coins like Monero, ZCash, Grin and Decred, all of which have strong cryptographers and programmers on their teams but struggle to do effective marketing. Still other altcoins have neither good marketing nor good technical teams and these do the worst of all.</p><p>The game that altcoins are playing is one of effective marketing. The most valuable coins have managed to create demand almost purely through marketing. In other words, the demand is largely artificial. The technical efforts can easily be copied, but marketing dollars cannot. This also explains why so many altcoins spend so much money on conference sponsorships, parties, airdrops, online ads and charitable contributions. The market cap of a coin tends to reflect the effectiveness of the coin’s marketing efforts.</p>Altcoin Trends<p>There are some clear trends on popular altcoins. Most altcoins are created right after a major Bitcoin bull market, going all the way back to 2011. Most altcoins, when they pump, do so at launch and during Bitcoin bull markets, which are clearly times when effective marketing is easiest when new s̶u̶c̶k̶e̶r̶s̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶b̶o̶r̶n̶ investors come in.</p><p>The technical details of a particular coin don’t seem to matter all that much. There’s no “fundamental” value to the technology or feature set, given that cloning coins is easy. Instead, technical “features” are more valuable for marketing purposes. All this is to say that the big reason altcoins have any value at all is because of marketing.</p>♦<p>The bull markets also give these coins a fresh lease on life through renewed marketing efforts. They all ride the coattails of Bitcoin’s bullish runs. Even during these bull runs, altcoins still fail if they’ve stopped marketing.</p>Conclusion<p>So what does this all mean practically? This is good news for traders because it turns out the technical facts for altcoins don’t really matter! Traders can base their altcoin trades on market perception and not have to bother with any due diligence of difficult-to-understand products.</p><p>For investors, however, the conclusion should be jarring. Technical competence or utility potential do not matter at all for price. The market caps of altcoins only indicate how good a job the token’s marketing departments have done, not anything fundamental about the coin, like the quality of developers, the soundness of the idea or even the existence of a product. Popularity cannot be used as a proxy for technical competence, product potential or returns. Popularity for an altcoin does not indicate anything other than marketing effectiveness. Reality bears this out.</p><p>As a result of being able to hack past the normal due diligence that happens with an asset through really good marketing, there are a lot of scams in the altcoin space. The lack of fundamentals combined with the out-sized role of marketing has led to a perfect combination that make scamming lucrative and nearly risk-free. Many investors that could do no wrong in late-2017/early-2018 are now heavily underwater as a result.</p><p>Which ones are scams and which ones are legitimate? Given the very skewed incentives, the only reasonable thing to do is to treat every altcoin as a scam until proven otherwise. We can only hope that the market has learned in time for the next Bitcoin bull run.</p>♦

  Etiam Ultimum Operum Mortalium Hominis<p>Letters from the Digital Saeculum (Part 2):</p><p>The First Message</p><p>The First Transmission (Part 1) is located here: medium.com/@HashedEntropy/what-hath-satoshi-wrought-f7687b631d42</p>♦For they are like a breath of air; their days are like a passing shadow. Psalm 144:4Fragility<p>Humans were so fragile. I used to wonder if humans were preoccupied by the thought of their own mortality, though I now know that transformations can be very gradual.</p><blockquote>If you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will of course frantically try to clamber out. But if you place it gently in a pot of tepid water and turn the heat on low, it will float there quite placidly. As the water gradually heats up, the frog will sink into a tranquil stupor, exactly like one of us in a hot bath, and before long, with a smile on its face, it will unresistingly allow itself to be boiled to death.</blockquote><blockquote>Parable as described by Daniel Quinn</blockquote><p>I now accept that mortality was an ever present reality for humans in which they were able to function without being crushed by an existential dread. Mortality was in the air they breathed, constantly floating and surrounding and flowing…it was their existence. They were vapor; there was no other way.</p><blockquote>Oh, how wrong were we to think that immortality never meant dying</blockquote><blockquote>Our Lady of Sorrows by My Chemical Romance</blockquote><p>As it is unknowable to ascertain when humans first became humans, it is as unknowable to fix the very moment when humans crossed the chasm into Homo Alium. Yet, we know for certain the identity and cause of The Last Mortal Man.</p><p>You have already read the words from The Last Mortal Man as shared in the The First Transmission.</p><p>Now I will share with you The First Message.</p>The First Message<p>Sacrifice was one of humanity’s greatest gifts.</p><blockquote>Human progress is neither automatic nor inevitable… Every step toward the goal of justice requires sacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and passionate concern of dedicated individuals.</blockquote><blockquote>Martin Luther King Jr.</blockquote><p>In 3 EMS, it was proven that Satoshi sacrificed wealth, power, and fame in order to allow bitcoin to survive its moment of greatest vulnerability. The question of Satoshi’s mortality or intentional anonymity was finally answered.</p>♦Photo of Book with Wings Sculpture by Anselm Kiefer (1992–1994); Materal: lead, tin, and steel<blockquote>But, you know, sometimes you just gotta be drop-kicked out of the nest…It’s the only thing that gets you to the next level, right?</blockquote><blockquote>Robert Downey Jr.</blockquote><p>In letting go, Satoshi provided the conditions for bitcoin to grow its anti-fragility, survive, and eventually thrive.</p><p>This was Satoshi’s sacrifice.</p><p>And The Last Mortal Man would someday make the last human sacrifice.</p>♦The fleeting moment of a bubble floating by the enduring sun<blockquote>Like the dew on the mountain,</blockquote><blockquote>Like the foam on the river,</blockquote><blockquote>Like the bubble on the fountain,</blockquote><blockquote>Thou art gone, and for ever!</blockquote><blockquote>Coronach by Sir Walter Scott</blockquote>The Crisis<p>In the First Transmission, you read of the Unraveling. You read the words of The Last Mortal Man. Now, I will share with you the story of what was lost and what led to The Last Mortal Man to make the final sacrifice.</p><p>The Shallows War was beyond brutal. Earth against Mars and humans against hubots. The de-center could not hold and the protocol that automated laws and rules and society was undermined. The Automarchy Dissolution resulted in a existence with no binding connectors. Incentives (both economic and governance) were no longer aligned. This led to a crisis greater than you can even imagine.</p><p>Beyond the standard rules of engagement that one might expect in an all out conflict, humans were the first to enact the “nuclear option.” The Shallows War showed that humans could not win a war on equal footing given the hubot’s embedded AI, quantum processors, and synchronicity. Out of the ashes, humans launched a Digital Purge strategy. By going completely offline, they quickly separated from their dependence on technology. They then attacked the hubs that powered hubots and assaulted any forms of digital existence. The Digital Purge reached totality in Mars and was on the verge of fully erasing the digital world from the Earth.</p><blockquote>We’re plugged in 24 hours a day now. We’re all part of one big machine, whether we are conscious of that or not. And if we can’t unplug from that machine, eventually we’re going to become mindless.</blockquote><blockquote>Alan Lightman</blockquote><p>But the hubots responded. And fittingly, they responded with code. A code was developed that would become known as the Human Entropy Laws. The concept was simple but extremely effective. Human behavior maintained a certain level of disorder and unpredictability. Through fine tuning their own behaviors, hubots were able to detect these irregularities and could eliminate the source. The source being humans.</p><p>Humans were left with two options: cede their freewill and humanity to align with the order range of hubots (and hence “to get in line”) or face destruction.</p><blockquote>My message to you is this: pretend that you have free will. It’s essential that you behave as if your decisions matter, even though you know they don’t. The reality isn’t important: what’s important is your belief, and believing the lie is the only way to avoid a waking coma. Civilization now depends on self-deception. Perhaps it always has.</blockquote><blockquote>Ted Chiang</blockquote>The Moment<p>All seemed lost, yet there was one that found another way. The Last Mortal Man had found a way to preserve humanity (thus undermining the Human Entropy Laws), to preserve hubotics (thus undermining the Digital Purge), and to preserve a lasting peace.</p>♦Monument to Earth Mars Synchronicity; Damaged during The Shallows War<p>And it partly involved going back to the source: back to a protocol, back to a decentralized peer-to-peer solution. Back to the economics. Back to that ancient honey badger. Back to bitcoin.</p><p>We know the very act, though it is not yet time to share with you those details.</p><p>We call it The Moment, the moment in which The Last Mortal Man made the sacrifice.</p><p>And there was a catch…</p><p>It would cost him everything and yet the worst part is that after The Moment, he would live 21 more years.</p><p>Can you imagine the turmoil of knowing that you will be the last human to face mortality and to have to grapple with that reality for years?</p><p>Remember, the Story is not over and as he described in the First Transmission, you are the hope.</p><p>For now, you should know that the end of The Last Mortal Man would also be the last death knell of humanity as you know it.</p><p>Though, somewhere in the fog of the Crisis:</p><p>Homo Alium would arise.</p>♦

  Introducing a New Set of Metrics to Help Time Bitcoin Market Cycles♦<p>Understanding the state of the Bitcoin blockchain with respect to the price at which BTC is being valued by the market is indispensable for any investor in this new asset.</p><p>In fact, Bitcoin on–chain data has been used in conjunction with off–chain market data in order to create metrics and indicators that help investors gain fundamental insights into the current state of the market, understand investor sentiment, or model the value of Bitcoin.</p><p>Popular examples are MVRV and SOPR.</p><p>These metrics have in common that they make use of Bitcoin’s underlying UTXO structure by comparing the value of Bitcoin at two different points in time: The current price and the price at the time a UTXO (bitcoin) was created (last moved), i.e. the realised price.</p><p>Here, we make use of the same underlying concept in order to answer a fundamental question:</p><blockquote>If all bitcoins were sold today, how much would investors stand to gain or lose?</blockquote><p>Or to put it differently: How much of Bitcoin’s circulating supply is at any given point in time in profit or loss — and to what extent?</p><p>The ability to access this information is important to investors with regard to Bitcoin’s primary narrative: to act as a digital, permissionless, censorship-resistant Store of Value (SoV).</p><p>To answer these questions, we take three different approaches and define new sets of metrics — each adding an additional level of detail:</p>1. The number of current UTXOs that are in profit/loss<p>A UTXO is in profit (loss) if the current price is higher (lower) than the price at the time the UTXO was created.</p>2. The current supply of Bitcoin that is in profit/loss<p>A bitcoin is in profit (loss) if the current price is higher (lower) than the price at the time the bitcoin last moved.</p>3. The unrealised profit/loss of the current Bitcoin supply<p>The profit (loss) of a bitcoin is calculated by taking the difference between the current price and the price at the time the bitcoin last moved.</p><p>Let’s dig in.</p>Number of UTXOs in Profit/Loss<p>The number of UTXOs in profit/loss is computed in a straight-forward manner: We simply count all existing UTXOs whose price at creation time was lower or higher than the current price, respectively.</p><p>Figure 1 below shows the absolute amount of UTXOs in profit/loss at any given point in time.</p>♦Figure 1 — Number of UTXOs in Profit and Loss<p>In order to account for the increasing number of UTXOs over time, we normalise these time series by the size of the UTXO set and obtain the relative number of UTXOs in profit/loss, i.e. the percentage.</p><p>Figure 2 below represents the 50d MA of the relative UTXO counts in profit. Note that when this metric approaches 100%, it has historically been a good indicator for global market tops.</p>♦Figure 2 — Relative Number of UTXOs in Profit, 50d Moving Average<p>The bull run of 2017, however, shows a distinct behaviour with a sustained period of profitable UTXOs above 95% – a clear indication of the remarkable nature of the bull run that year. Throughout those months, the metric can be used to help identify short-term cycles and as a clear indicator to stay highly alerted throughout the mania of such periods.</p><p>Note that the relative number of UTXOs in profit approaches 100% every time a previous ATH price is broken – this is self-evident as it becomes nearly impossible to be in losses once a new ATH is surpassed. Therefore, we applied the simple 50d MA, which we have found to fit historic data optimally and which creates a signal that serves to indicate global/local Bitcoin cycle tops as shown above.</p><blockquote>Live implementations of UTXOs in Profit/Loss metrics are available in Glassnode Studio:</blockquote><blockquote>Percent UTXOs in Profit<br>UTXOs in Profit<br>UTXOs in Loss</blockquote>Circulating Supply in Profit/Loss<p>A similar but even more informative metric is the number of circulating bitcoins that are in profit or loss. Instead of counting UTXOs, we now consider their bitcoin value (i.e. individual bitcoins) and sum up those whose price at the time they last moved was lower or higher than the current price, respectively.</p><p>The stacked graph below shows the supply of bitcoins in profit/loss at any given point in time.</p>♦Figure 3 — Circulating Bitcoin Supply in Profit and Loss<p>Similarly, we adjust this data by dividing by the circulating supply and obtain the relative Bitcoin supply (i.e. percentage) that is in profit/loss.</p>♦Figure 4 — Relative Bitcoin Supply in Profit and Loss<p>The resulting graph is a metric we have found to be exceptionally useful to help understand Bitcoin market cycles.</p><p>Let’s take close look at the Percent of Supply in Profit, again applying the 50d MA.</p>♦Figure 5 — Relative Bitcoin Supply in Profit, 50d Moving Average<p>The Percent of Supply in Profit metric represents an oscillator that allows us to better understand the current state of the Bitcoin market:</p><ul><li>In a similar fashion to the relative UTXO count chart above, using a simple threshold at 95% helps to identify market tops.</li><li>By looking at periods in which the relative supply in profit falls below 50%, this indicator is useful to help identify market bottoms and convenient entry points.</li></ul><blockquote>Live implementations of Supply in Profit/Loss metrics are available in Glassnode Studio:</blockquote><blockquote>Percent Supply in Profit<br>Supply in Profit<br>Supply in Loss</blockquote>Unrealised Profit/Loss<p>Finally, we take a step further and look at the Unrealised Profit/Loss of Bitcoin.</p><p>In comparison to simply summing up the circulating supply that is in profit or loss, Unrealised Profit/Loss takes into account the actual USD value by which a bitcoin is in gains/losses. In other words, we weight each circulating bitcoin by the difference between the current price and its realised price and sum up all bitcoins in profit and loss, respectively.</p><p>Mathematically speaking Unrealised Profit (UP) and Unrealised Loss(UL) are defined as</p>♦<p>and</p>♦<p>respectively.</p><p>The following graph shows Bitcoin’s raw Unrealised Profit/Loss.</p>♦Figure 6 — Unrealised Bitcoin Profit and Loss<p>While the UP line very much resembles the shape of the Bitcoin price, the amount of unrealised loss (UL) shows a distinctive pattern with clear-cut downward spikes at periods in which the losses are virtually non-existent. These moments naturally correspond to those in which the relative number of bitcoins/UTXOs in profit approaches 100% (see Figures 2+5).</p><p>In order to obtain a conclusive and more informative metric, we normalise the data by the market cap, giving us the Relative Unrealised Profit (RUP) and the Relative Unrealised Loss (RUL). The resulting signals clearly reveal distinct patterns at different states of the market cycles.</p>♦Figure 7 — Relative Unrealised Profit and Loss<p>In particular we see how the RUP spikes (RUP &gt; 0.75) indicate potential tops and selling points. Conversely, periods in which the RUL exceeds the RUP (RUP &lt; RUL) have been historically indicative of market bottoms and good buying opportunities.</p><p>By taking the delta of both curves, we finally calculate the Net Unrealised Profit/Loss (NUPL).</p><p>Deconstructing this signal into different bands gives insight into market sentiment derived from on–chain data. The thresholds below are set at 0.0, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75. Even though arbitrary, historically they show accurate patterns that can be attributed to distinct sentiments throughout the macro cycles of Bitcoin.</p>♦Figure 8 — Net Unrealised Profit/Loss (NUPL)<p>By mapping these bands to the price of Bitcoin we see how the NUPL represents different periods of the Bitcoin market cycles. Understanding the current NUPL value can help investors navigate through different stages of the market and identify periods of profit taking as well as efficient entry points.</p>♦Figure 9 — NUPL Bands applied to the Bitcoin Price<p>UPDATE: Net Unrealised Profit/Loss has been previously derived by Adamant Capital in a different manner: They calculate it by subtracting realised cap from market cap, and dividing the result by the market cap, i.e.(Market Cap — Realised Cap) / Market Cap. This is mathematically in fact equivalent to the derivation introduced here: Unrealised Profit * Market Cap — Unrealised Loss * Market Cap.</p><blockquote>Live implementations of Unrealised Profit/Loss metrics are available in Glassnode Studio:</blockquote><blockquote>Net Unrealised Profit/Loss (NUPL)<br>Relative Unrealised Profit (RUP)<br>Relative Unrealised Loss (RUL)</blockquote>Summary<p>We explored and presented a set of on–chain metrics that incorporate the relationship between the current price and the realised price of Bitcoin.

  <p>About a year ago, I was talking to someone about how difficult it was to get myself to write. I had been working on a book for O’Reilly and Associates for about 9 months at that point and had talked to other authors who acknowledged the same problem. Many authors find that books take a long time to write with 2 years being the norm. The 14 months that I took for my book was relatively fast, according to my editors.</p>Why is book writing so slow?<p>It occurred to me that there must be a better way. After all, I’m a programmer and I’ve done crazier, more daunting tasks in a much shorter amount of time . What was different? Why was writing a book, or more specifically, getting into a flow to write so hard?</p><p>The problem was motivation. It’s easy to get stuck in a pit of despair with a large hill to climb. In the situations where I was most in the flow, the main motivators were a clear purpose, a clear goal, and most importantly, other people depending on me. Could a book be written the same way an application is prototyped? That is, quickly and iteratively as in a design or coding sprint? Could you really write a book in a week or less?</p><p>I became obsessed with the book sprint idea and I started mentioning it to some friends. I found that the coordination to create the right environment is pretty difficult given that everyone has obligations. The book sprint idea would have to wait to be paired with the right project that would be worthy of such coordination.</p>The Project<p>The project was not something I had expected to get involved in. I’ve been a programmer for a long time and though I care about human rights, it’s not something I’ve been actively involved in during my 20+ year career. Everything changed when I met Alex Gladstein. He invited me to have dinner with some folks from the Human Rights Foundation who had a real use for Bitcoin, the subject of the book I had just written. It turns out that Bitcoin is helping lots of people in distressed places with authoritarian regimes. I learned a lot about what they were doing and we promised to keep in touch.</p>♦<p>Alex called me a short while later asking me if I would review a book idea he and a co-author had. The idea was how Bitcoin was changing society, especially in the realm of human rights. This would necessarily require some description of Bitcoin and why a government couldn’t control it, so they wanted my review.</p>Bringing Together a Book Sprint<p>They wanted to pitch me on the idea, but I wanted to pitch them on book sprinting to see how well it could work.</p><p>You would think most people would tell me I’m crazy to think that a book can be written so fast, but reactions are consistently the opposite. Most people think right away that writing a book in a week is possible. This is likely because we’ve all done herculean tasks in a short amount of time. Maybe you were in a group project in college or managed to recreate the whole application in a crazy week before release at a startup. We’ve all done something superhuman with a group of people over a short amount of time. These are often some of our best memories and proudest moments.</p><p>In the end, we were enthused about book sprinting this project and we decided to gather some more people. After some discussion about who would be good for the project, we ended up with 8 people for a 4-day sprint in August. We weren’t sure at all if that would be enough time, but we decided to give it a go.</p>The Setup<p>We managed to get a place where we could all sleep, eat and work in early August. We wanted to be free from distractions to just work on the book. We had plenty of coffee, a good amount of food and lots of post-it notes and pens. We even had a gym, swimming pool, and a nice kitchen to cook our food.</p>♦<p>We all brought our laptops, had a lot of places to discuss one-on-one, other places to work quietly and still other places to discuss everything in a group setting. We made liberal use of food delivery services and relaxed every evening.</p>Figuring Out What to Write<p>Taking a lead from design and code sprint principles, we started by getting into the mind of our target audience. We did an exercise where we each described the audience we had in mind. We wanted a good idea of where they would be at before reading the book, so we did a little role play to get into character. We asked our hypothetical audience member what they knew about Bitcoin, what their impressions about it were and what their biggest questions were.</p><p>We also wrote down what their reviews would be after reading our book. These served later as something like acceptance tests for our book. Everything we would write later had to be evaluated on whether it would help readers get to the review we wanted.</p>♦<p>Now that we knew where our audience was before and after the book, it gave us a good idea what knowledge the reader lacked. We then listed everything possible that could help the reader get from point A to point B on separate post-it notes. We then put them on the wall and started organizing them together.</p>Organizing<p>We gathered at the sticky-filled wall and started to organize the ideas into groups. There were some obvious categories to write about, but some seemed to be completely out on their own. After an hour or so, we managed to group them and label what would become our chapters.</p><p>We put the chapter titles on bigger post-it notes and started discussing what the table of contents would look like. What sort of flow through these topics would help the readers? How could we get the reviews we wanted? What started as ten chapters were combined and shrunk to six chapters in an order that was both engaging and clear.</p>♦<p>At this point we were at the end of Day One, but we felt really good about where we were. We knew what topics we needed to write about (chapters), and topics each chapter needed to cover (post it notes in each chapter). The only thing left were the actual words.</p>Writing<p>The next two days went surprisingly fast. We assigned first drafts and kept a record of who reviewed what chapter on a whiteboard so everyone could see. Everyone wrote, re-wrote, edited, re-edited and every chapter was seen by everyone. The only rule was that when you got to the chapter, you could edit, add or delete anything. The mentality that we had was one of group ownership. This or that section wasn’t any one person’s it was all of ours. We checked in every 3–6 hours, ate together, hosted some guests who dropped by and slept when we could.</p>♦<p>There’s something to be said about working in close proximity to one another in this environment. Whenever anyone got stuck, they asked for clarification or asked others for thoughts on the topic. There really wasn’t any room for writer’s block as we knew that everyone else was depending on us. The first drafts of each chapter were completed in about 6 hours. Each round after that took about 3 hours each. Everyone added their own perspectives in each round of edits. Sometimes whole sections would be added. Other times, there would be illustrations or stories here and there, and still others improving the style.</p>♦<p>At the end of the Day Three, we had a manuscript with the content but not quite the voice we wanted. Still, we sent the book out for review by trusted friends who fit the audience profile. In the meantime we started to make the voice in the book consistent. We found that the book worked better by rearranging the longest chapter into a Q&amp;A section at the end of the book.</p>Review<p>The last day was spent on a lot of copy-editing. Asking questions such as: Is this concept clear to someone that doesn’t know anything about Bitcoin? Did we mention this concept yet by this time in the text? What other illustrations do we need?</p>♦<p>The review process is where we found that we had some conflicts. Should we include this section or that? How much detail does this particular section need? There was a lot of disagreement and hence a lot of talking through what we needed to change. It’s easy to see why. There was a lot of effort that sometimes got deleted and it’s easy to feel slighted.</p><p>In the end, we reviewed the whole book, rewrote certain parts and uploaded the laid out book to Amazon which can be seen here.</p>Conclusion<p>I can say with confidence that book sprinting is very different than traditional book writing. There was a lot more energy, creativity, and excitement in sprinting instead of the slog, dread and boredom of the normal process. Of course, there was also more conflict, discussion and throwing away, but overall, the trade-off was totally worth it.</p>♦<p>I was shocked at the quality of what we could achieve in such a short time. I’m very proud of how the book turned out and I am sure my co-authors would say the same. This might be a good time to mention them by name: Timi Ajiboye, {cryptonight}, Alex Gladstein, Lily Liu, Alex Lloyd, Alejandro Machado, and Alena Vranova. I can say confidently that this book brought us together in a way that no conference or group meeting could.</p><p>The key piece seems to be what we did the first day where we agreed on what we were trying to write. That helped guide a lot of our discussions and made disagreements less personal.</p><p>If there was anything I would change, it would be to involve an editor from the beginning. A lot of passages needed fleshing out and others needed tightening up. Trying to make the voice a little more consistent from the beginning would have helped a lot.</p><p>That said, the sprinting process was incredibly enlightening about what can be done when a group is motivated. We made a book describing why Bitcoin matters in four days! I know for myself that I’ll try more book sprints. You can see the results for yourself here.</p>♦

Et in Arcadia Ego







<p>This is a hermeneutical monograph on Walter Benjamin&#8217;s &#8220;On the Concept of History&#8221; from the perspective of a crypto-anarchist in the digital age. </p>







<blockquote><p>1.</p><p>It is well-known that an automaton once existed, which was so constructed that it could counter any move of a chess-player with a counter-move, and thereby assure itself of victory in the match. A puppet in Turkish attire, water-pipe in mouth, sat before the chessboard, which rested on a broad table. Through a system of mirrors, the illusion was created that this table was transparent from all sides. In truth, a hunchbacked dwarf who was a master chess-player sat inside, controlling the hands of the puppet with strings. One can envision a corresponding object to this apparatus in philosophy. The puppet called “historical materialism” is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of theology, which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight.</p></blockquote>



<p>Deep Blue could appraise up to 200 million chess-positions per second more than two decades ago. It was the most powerful supercomputer at the time, and it was developed for the explicit purpose of a brute force strategy against the chess board. No longer do we need ugly theology, but the bonitas intrinseca of mathematics, hallowed be thy Empty Name…</p>



<p>There is a story of a Wizard who was all-powerful and lived at the end of a golden road. He could heal people of their aliments and woes while he ruled from a top his emerald tower as only a God could. One can imagine a philosophical counterpart to this. This animation is little more than smoke and mirrors, yet an entire city of emerald was built from the power of the watchful eye of the automaton, the gaze which ruled without violence. He did this through a gaze which commenced from the machine’s operatively — a panopticon of the greatest order, where a false god declares his impoverished, temporal power which can reign over all of life through a perverted and sinister gaze that demands everything be watched.</p>



<p>We know in the end there is just a shrived, pathetic little man perhaps touching himself behind a curtain whose purpose is to both hide him as much as it is to expose us. And yet he was still able to rule like a God from this automaton he created. This man only had the power of the sleight of hand and guile which created the functions of his rule — and yet Doctor Faustus of the Machine was still able rule his prison as if he were a god!</p>



<p>This liturgy of control and blasphemy of power points towards the two opposite directions of sovereign power which re-fuses into each other at the most extreme cases. When the two most extreme forms of the exception within sovereign power encounter each other directly and totally, it creates a singular moment in time-space where the true nature of arcanum imperii is finally reviled. Truth or Authority. God or Law. Life or Death. </p>



<p>In this moment the Messiah may enter the gate and take his place on the throne that will allow for his reign, but for him to never rule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In otherwords, Arcanum Imperii is the final secret in which God shows his total opposition to all myth. Mythical violence is confronted by the divine in the final battle for the soul of man and what it means to be human. It is only in this final moment, place, and space in which the two final forms of total power openly unveil themselves to all of humanity for the bare naked truth to testify. It is in that moment that the whole constellation of the history of man finally alines, finishes compiling, and allows for the lighting strike to unleash, that the providence of man is illuminated for the briefest of moments. </p>



<p>It is only from this inverted, hypostatized place of the direct and total encounter between God and Law, that Spinozian God may subsume his rightful place for the final closure to the door of law. This closure opens the possibility of a path to His kingdom, where the one and only law reigns absolutely, but without violence.</p>



<p>It is no wonder that Kasparov suspected Deeper Blue of needing a human to intervene in the end. No matter how much power the machine had, it still did not have the Dionysian Kyros of the human soul. The bombastic suicide the ego will seek out and offer itself up as the final sacrifice in the name of vengeance for something more. To go beyond, for those who have touched bottom and for the silenced Other in order to affirm that we do have a soul, that this place does matter, and it all means something. Sometimes the most powerful thing to be done to establish justice is to fight back with a kind of vengeance only God himself can embody. Sometimes, taking a motherfucker’s eyes is all that matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is Arcanum Imperii and it is the secret of power which has always ruled: Political power grows from the barrel of a gun, which creates a political theology which captures all of life, forcing everyone into the final distinction of friend, or enemy; life or death. </p>



<p>However, there is another form of power that presents itself hidden in this place. It is the power of refusal. To state firmly, “I’d rather not,” while staring down the barrel of a gun with the understanding of the consequence of such. It is from here, when the power of violence is shown to no longer hodl affect or sway over that which it wishes to destroy, we find another totalizing and extreme form of power which no force or violence can destroy.</p>



<blockquote><p>2.</p><p>“Among the most noteworthy characteristics of human beings,” says Lotze, “belongs… next to so much self-seeking in individuals, the general absence of envy of each present in relation to the future.” This reflection shows us that the picture of happiness which we harbor is steeped through and through in the time which the course of our own existence has conferred on us. The happiness which could awaken envy in us exists only in the air we have breathed, with people we could have spoken with, with women who might have been able to give themselves to us. The conception of happiness, in other words, resonates irremediably with that of resurrection [Erloesung: transfiguration, redemption]. It is just the same with the conception of the past, which makes history into its affair. The past carries a secret index with it, by which it is referred to its resurrection. Are we not touched by the same breath of air which was among that which came before? is there not an echo of those who have been silenced in the voices to which we lend our ears today? have not the women, who we court, sisters who they do not recognize anymore? If so, then there is a secret protocol [Verabredung: also appointment] between the generations of the past and that of our own. For we have been expected upon this earth. For it has been given us to know, just like every generation before us, a weak messianic power, on which the past has a claim. This claim is not to be settled lightly. The historical materialist knows why.</p></blockquote>



<p>There will be a Kingdom of Heaven on this Earth — this has been foretold for millennia, and it has accrued a heavy interest in that time. This claim can only be settled for the steepest of prices which was set by the past long ago, to which the current interest rate of the world has fixed itself to. Coinsidering the fiat price of things, that is a cost that is not too high, and can always be paid in fraud of paper debt, but only at each of our own choosing. It is a crime for the promise of another anonymous life, a method to absconded away from the physical realm of wrath and tears, and the promise of something else for oneself, by oneself. </p>



<p>This fantasy of another life offers a kind of envy we could only find in a fallen world like ours and that is our current form-of-life. From this utopian fantasy, a new form of totally private life seen from the decrypted lens of a liberated future where we can find our true sense of happiness. It is a vision that is tied up in a world that has seen The Last Judgment, and passed into an age in which happiness is pervasive, everlasting, and infinitely given. In other words, there is a life that is just given; which is there entirely for itself — there is nothing to be said of it, only an experience to be lived, a politics to be refused, a privacy to be hedl. </p>



<p>The building of facts of the world as it has truly been is the secret index that points towards the direction from which the thunderclap of finality will come. To build the public ledger of crimes for all the world to see, and allow for the Book of Judgement to begin its tallying, compiling, and computing from which the Final Order can be computed, calculated, and committed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The echo which has us turn towards the past and seek the clues for a liberated future firmly eludes to the world that could have been. This future was profaned and doomed for each new posterity to wait another generation, an another cycle of interest to compound. Each generation waits for their impoverished messiah to seek access to the gate of the law, only to find themselves infinitely waiting for his return, unaware he died long ago.</p>



<p>Humanity has been waiting before the law for eternity, and it is only now in what could be man’s final hideous moment does he come to the transcendental realization of what this means. The door was never made to be entered, but only closed. The catastrophe of law has interloped into every sphere of our private lives, and is now the very hearth of our existence. It is through this Door of Law that it imposes itself as the only answer does the total nakedness and horror for what it really: the Final Solution — to all of life.</p>



<p>“Arbeit macht frei” is the hollow, weak bleat we hear from the vacancy of the musselmen; their eyes consume us with the prattle and fear that define this place. We cannot look them straight on; or we will be petrified with horror from the Medusian gaze which pulled them under. To look directly at the sin is too much; seeing evidence of the crimes is more than enough proof that doing our masters bidding will do anything but set us free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is our task to hear beyond the screams in the everlasting night, to ensure that the door of law will be finally be closed, so that the gates to to the kingdom of heaven may open. This is the only way to attain justice in a fallen world where cries for consanguinity go unanswered, and only the violence of darkness rules the jungle of infinite night we call life.</p>



<p>The generations before us who fought and died for the ideals which will make The Redeemed Future is of the same current that has set the general course of history. It is only now, at the end of the culmination of humanity as Man The Animal, that we can sit on the cliff to eternity, and look over the barbaric and bloody path of bones that has allowed for us to scale to here. We can lean over the edge of this cliff to see a liberated future where no war exist and peace pervades all — if only we are to jump and end it for once and for all. Maybe we will fly, or maybe we will die; but at least the decision has been made, rather than to continue to climb the mountain of bones we call progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is when we reconfigure reality to be the waking-dream, an ecstatic celebration where we are amongst our brothers and sisters, in the household of the world and the community that contains all of humanity;  we can finally know the conditions of Erloesung for what it really is. The secret protocol of what is true, honest, good, and is the permanent, and everlasting. It is the Whatever of a private life that is lived for itself and only for itself, and for the happiness that must contain. </p>



<p>This form-of-life is totally separate from the so-called progress into which the future is tumbling aimlessly with dangerous vertigo, and reckless vacancy. This form-of-life beyond the veil is built from the irredeemable conditions that creates the world as we know to be true, building toward the final moment in which everything comes to serve its purpose, and Kryos unveils himself as the final steward of Providence to settle this claim from the past; preparing His throne so the Gate may open and our generation will have the opportunity to fulfill the Kingdom of Heaven on this earth.</p>



<blockquote><p>3.</p><p>The chronicler, who recounts events without distinguishing between the great and small, thereby accounts for the truth, that nothing which has ever happened is to be given as lost to history. Indeed, the past would fully befall only a resurrected humanity. Said another way: only for a resurrected humanity would its past, in each of its moments, be citable. Each of its lived moments becomes a citation a l’ordre du jour [order of the day] — whose day is precisely that of the Last Judgment.</p></blockquote>



<p>The power of Bitcoin was not to create another form of money, but to create a ledger of truth that has an economic incentive behind it. The bodies that creates the digital noosphere which is bonded to the whole social body of the globe, recounts every moment and event without distinguishing between the great and small, thereby accounts for the whole of the Truth to which only the past can claim. With the images, sounds, and videos as the proof of the past which becoming clearer, and resounding more fervently as we grow more distant from it, and more evidence compiles for it; the final order of things unveils itself. The accumulation of primary archeological evidence from here on out compels a grand focusing of the lens towards what Truth is to be established.</p>



<p>Nothing significant that happens now can be lost to history anymore.</p>



<p>The digital will crystallize the moments of each day to be frozen in time as it really was, for all of time to come. Now we are building unto that final moment when enough information for The Judgment to be executed. With every single action notarized, weighed, and analyzed; He will decide who enters into his Kingdom, and who are the Sons of Perdition are who would trade His son for thirty pieces of silver.</p>



<blockquote><p>4.</p><p>‘Secure at first food and clothing, and the kingdom of God will come to you of itself.’ — Hegel, 1807</p><p>The class struggle, which always remains in view for a historian schooled in Marx, is a struggle for the rough and material things, without which there is nothing fine and spiritual. Nevertheless these latter are present in the class struggle as something other than mere booty, which falls to the victor. They are present as confidence, as courage, as humor, as cunning, as steadfastness in this struggle, and they reach far back into the mists of time. They will, ever and anon, call every victory which has ever been won by the rulers into question. Just as flowers turn their heads towards the sun, so too does that which has been turn, by virtue of a secret kind of heliotropism, towards the sun which is dawning in the sky of history. To this most inconspicuous of all transformations the historical materialist must pay heed.</p></blockquote>



<p>But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you. — [Redacted]</p>



<p>God is dead, and he was long before we got here. The righteousness of the struggle to live free or die trying is recognized in the branded flesh of Man throughout all of history who have scummed in horrific magnitudes, and continue to do so today under the yoke of the techo-global fascist machine. The hideous recognition that The State of Exception governs all, and allows for all humans to be placed outside and beyond the law is also the recognition of the Abomination of Desolation of the law itself.</p>



<p>There are no more questions to be asked; words to be spoken, pleas to be give. There is only a thirst for vengeance, a vicious hatred to stoke the flames of righteous indignation for what we have become. The time for the decision to make the action which we all know must be done is finally here; and there is nothing that can stop it. For each victory they ever hold, we shall always know that it a temporary and impotent one which has already been profaned and cursed from beyond the grave. The secrets of the shadows contains the vile and contempt which is already incubate the successful resistance for the next fight with the seed of indignation. Those of the future shall spit on the names of today’s victors, politicians, and bureaucrats; having bared witness to the documentation of their atrocities, the horrors which they engaged, and utter blasphemy of declaring themselves the purveyors of God’s Law; or any law for that matter. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the truth that will never run away from us. The meticulously documentation of the present shall act as the testament to the future of the barbarism of its past. It shall provide l’ordre du jour for the rest of time, a founding document for a new form of Law, and the testimony for why such an novus ordo seclorum is not just needed, but demanded.</p>



<p>It is only when we can see that we will lose everything and The Catastrophe will consume all, that the Katechon will show itself, and we will be free to do the final action which God has summoned us to do.</p>



<blockquote><p>5.</p><p>The true picture of the past whizzes by. Only as a picture, which flashes its final farewell in the moment of its recognizability, is the past to be held fast. “The truth will not run away from us” — this remark by Gottfried Keller denotes the exact place where historical materialism breaks through historicism’s picture of history. For it is an irretrievable picture of the past, which threatens to disappear with every present, which does not recognize itself as meant in it.</p></blockquote>



<p>We can never truly know the fullness of the past, but there are clues to left to us in the form of photos, videos, and other direct evidence as witness as archive that can allow for us to build the truth as it really was. These are just shards of the shattered mirror into which we can look into the past to see Medusa’s curse of law staring back at us. However, it is each of these fragments that allow for a thousand of the same reflections to see the single past as it really was.</p>



<p>Historical materialist understands that it is on the side of the vanquished, impoverished, and those who touched bottom for good reason. The Truth of what was will stand firm in front of us, refusing to go with the narrative of the present and the propaganda of the machine. Our task is to recognize the bias of the present which contorts the evidence of the past to create an irredeemable future. In creating the sacred and divine task for a free future all; no one will be able to hide from the gaze of a God who imposes The Truth upon all for everyone to see.</p>



<blockquote><p>6.</p><p>To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it ‘the way it really was’ (Ranke). It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger. Historical materialism wishes to retain that image of the past which unexpectedly appears to man singled out by history at a moment of danger. The danger affects both the content of the tradition and its receivers. The same threat hangs over both: that of becoming a tool of the ruling classes. In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it. The Messiah comes not only as the redeemer, he comes as the subduer of Antichrist. Only that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins. And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historical materialist only see this moment of danger — the State of Emergency — as the tradition of man. As in war, we have entrenched ourselves so deeply in the ideology of war that no longer is there a possibility of peace on earth, but only the silence between bomb drops, gun shots, and screams of agony. Our trauma is now a tool of the ruling class, which they use to keep us terrified, separated, subservient, and most importantly, alienated. Each of us blush with the acknowledgment of our compromise to keep ourselves inside the iron cage, cutting the sinews to our greatest power. Is there no longer any form of radicalism that could call itself revolutionary? This is no mistake, but is the logical conclusion of a humanity that only has lies, deceit, and prattle left to navigate the world, for we all live in the concentration camps that we call life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only He who can incubate the Divine and Profane spark that will ignite these facts with such beauty, imperiousness, and grace will we be able to call the Messiah. The One who no person can look at, for they have no name, no face no body. The one who is the hero with a thousand faces, and will die a thousand and one times. The Nameless, unidentifiable, Other who can only be called Anonymous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No-body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will be him; the decapitated, wretched disemboweled Acephale who has cut out his own heart to make a grenade of passion and glory from which he will explode history from this epoch.</p>



<p>It will be with this final weapon of Truth found within hyper-technology of Bitcoin that will act as the citations in l’ordre du jour for the Last Judgement of the Multitude on the Criminal. Then even the dead will cry out from beyond the grave for that which was promised, and that which will be delivered and redeemed. </p>



<blockquote><p>7.</p><p>Think of the darkness and the great cold<br>&nbsp;In this valley, which resounds with misery.<br> — Brecht, Threepenny Opera</p><p>Fustel de Coulanges recommended to the historian, that if he wished to reexperience an epoch, he should remove everything he knows about the later course of history from his head. There is no better way of characterizing the method with which historical materialism has broken. It is a procedure of empathy. Its origin is the heaviness at heart, the acedia, which despairs of mastering the genuine historical picture, which so fleetingly flashes by. The theologians of the Middle Ages considered it the primary cause of melancholy. Flaubert, who was acquainted with it, wrote: “Peu de gens devineront combien il a fallu être triste pour ressusciter Carthage.” [Few people can guess how despondent one has to be in order to resuscitate Carthage.] The nature of this melancholy becomes clearer, once one asks the question, with whom does the historical writer of historicism actually empathize. The answer is irrefutably with the victor. Those who currently rule are however the heirs of all those who have ever been victorious. Empathy with the victors thus comes to benefit the current rulers every time. This says quite enough to the historical materialist. Whoever until this day emerges victorious, marches in the triumphal procession in which today’s rulers tread over those who are sprawled underfoot. The spoils are, as was ever the case, carried along in the triumphal procession. They are known as the cultural heritage. In the historical materialist they have to reckon with a distanced observer. For what he surveys as the cultural heritage is part and parcel of a lineage [Abkunft: descent] which he cannot contemplate without horror. It owes its existence not only to the toil of the great geniuses, who created it, but also to the nameless drudgery of its contemporaries. There has never been a document of culture, which is not simultaneously one of barbarism. And just as it is itself not free from barbarism, neither is it free from the process of transmission, in which it falls from one set of hands into another. The historical materialist thus moves as far away from this as measurably possible. He regards it as his task to brush history against the grain.</p></blockquote>



<p>In no other time in history has the empathy of the world been so barren as to drive droves of people to take their own lives. The incredible abyss of despondency that is this world drowns all who are lost within the hollowness of everything. The musselman waits in traffic and stares back at us at supermarkets. The moral wound of being in this place, devoid of meaning could almost convince one that reality was devoid of meaning, and not just of the pathos of one-dimensional men. Despite the historicism  that has created the world as it stands today, it cannot rid itself of the artifacts of truth that directly point to each and every brick of barbarism upon which the whole of the West was built. This is what drives people to such depths of despair to believe that there is no other choice for them but to be rid of this world, and hope that there is something better on the other side.</p>



<p>Objects of culture and veneration all have a secret history which is caked in the blood of the innocent, and forgotten under the cries of patriotism  which holds them as precious objects which are definitive of the nation. The historical materialist does not want to consider these objects falling into their hands, and happily provides the blindspot in which the true path of history takes. From their own ignorant need to posses a power which they cannot understand, they fall victim the same circumstances which has befallen every victor who eventually trasmutate into the victim of the fatal virus of power.</p>



<p>The Task cannot become another chapter within this horrendous span of time, another oscillation of hyperviolence from revolution to counter-revolution, and back again; but to mark the end of it with the Final Epoch. There is no throne to take power from, only The empty one to prepare. There is no redemption, only expiation.</p>



<blockquote><p>7.</p><p>The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “emergency situation” in which we live is the rule. We must arrive at a concept of history which corresponds to this. Then it will become clear that the task before us is the introduction of a real state of emergency; and our position in the struggle against Fascism will thereby improve. Not the least reason that the latter has a chance is that its opponents, in the name of progress, greet it as a historical norm. — The astonishment that the things we are experiencing in the 20th century are “still” possible is by no means philosophical. It is not the beginning of knowledge, unless it would be the knowledge that the conception of history on which it rests is untenable.</p></blockquote>



<p>The emergency is The State in its final form. It is the culmination of the totalizing form-of-life of the scientific-materialist, whose callow blindness in serving the state machine has allowed for all of us to be captured within the concentration camps we call life. It is the shaken and goulash eyes of the musselmen found everywhere in society, who meditate on ‘arbeit macht frei’ where we find our real answer. We only need to look at the silent dead, the bodies found in mass graves, and the next wave of people being pushed from their homes and land to know our position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emergency is now.</p>



<p>The emergency is the present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emergency is our life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The natural course of ‘progress’ which we see is the progress of power — its consolidation through ruthless and raw violence with the ever-changing faces of the state, and the Infinity War it bring under the banner of ‘peace’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beginning of knowledge rest upon the capacity to ask for forgiveness for all that has befallen all of man; and to open the path to redemption through only a silent action which resounds and reverberates louder than anything that can be said. Only then, may the Gate open.</p>



<blockquote><p>9.</p><p>My wing is ready to fly<br>&nbsp;I would rather turn back<br>For had I stayed mortal time<br>&nbsp;I would have had little luck.</p><cite>— Gerhard Scholem, “Angelic Greetings”</cite></blockquote>



♦



<blockquote><p>There is a painting by Klee called Angelus Novus. An angel is depicted there who looks as though he were about to distance himself from something which he is staring at. His eyes are opened wide, his mouth stands open and his wings are outstretched. The Angel of History must look just so. His face is turned towards the past. Where we see the appearance of a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe, which unceasingly piles rubble on top of rubble and hurls it before his feet. He would like to pause for a moment so fair [verweilen: a reference to Goethe’s Faust], to awaken the dead and to piece together what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise, it has caught itself up in his wings and is so strong that the Angel can no longer close them. The storm drives him irresistibly into the future, to which his back is turned, while the rubble-heap before him grows sky-high. That which we call progress, is this storm.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Catastrophe in which we live is the building towards the final eschatology moment. The casting of rubble, upon rubble until there is nothing left at his feet is due to there being  no object that does not become rubble in the building of the Stairway to Heaven for the final Accent to His Kingdom. The horrors of the world present themselves with such clarity for the complete contrast of Evil from otherwise; this is how all things become rubble in the face of God; the truth of all things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>God himself set the machinery of his clock at the beginning. All events are already known and completed in the final time in which he reigns but does not rule. For us to reach Elysium we must simply close our wings, and forsake a god which would subject us to such conditions. God is dead, and he was long before we came here. Now He may be rebuilt, in all of his spectre, grandeur, and glory and what that means in the world of today.</p>



<blockquote><p>10.</p><p>The objects which the monastic rules assigned to monks for meditation had the task of making the world and its drives repugnant. The mode of thought which we pursue today comes from a similar determination. It has the intention, at a moment wherein the politicians in whom the opponents of Fascism had placed their hopes have been knocked supine, and have sealed their downfall by the betrayal of their own cause, of freeing the political child of the world from the nets in which they have ensnared it. The consideration starts from the assumption that the stubborn faith in progress of these politicians, their trust in their “mass basis” and finally their servile subordination into an uncontrollable apparatus have been three sides of the same thing. It seeks to give an idea of how dearly it will cost our accustomed concept of history, to avoid any complicity with that which these politicians continue to hold fast to.</p></blockquote>



<p>We have already created a new world and culture in which the meatspace is to be despised and deplored; identifying with the flesh is sacrilege, and the concealment of private key is a sacrosanct. As with the rise and fall of each ‘hero’ who comes to challenge fascism, we disparage them too lightly with each endorsement of hope they offer. Their faith in the fate of politics, with their wholly corrupted leaders, and fanatically devotion to a system of exploitation, violence, and stupidity shows the insanity of the reality which they refuse to let go of. It is our task to force the facts to be what they are and to present them as such for all to see. Only then can we bear witness to the dearness this has cost all of us, and a grief that only silence can hold.</p>



<blockquote><p>11.</p><p>The conformism which has dwelt within social democracy from the very beginning rests not merely on its political tactics, but also on its economic conceptions. It is a fundamental cause of the later collapse. There is nothing which has corrupted the German working-class so much as the opinion that they were swimming with the tide. Technical developments counted to them as the course of the stream, which they thought they were swimming in. From this, it was only a step to the illusion that the factory-labor set forth by the path of technological progress represented a political achievement. The old Protestant work ethic celebrated its resurrection among German workers in secularized form. The Gotha Program [dating from the 1875 Gotha Congress] already bore traces of this confusion. It defined labor as “the source of all wealth and all culture.” Suspecting the worst, Marx responded that human being, who owned no other property aside from his labor-power, “must be the slave of other human beings, who… have made themselves into property-owners.” Oblivious to this, the confusion only increased, and soon afterwards Josef Dietzgen announced: “Labor is the savior of modern times… In the… improvement… of labor… consists the wealth, which can now finally fulfill what no redeemer could hitherto achieve.” This vulgar-Marxist concept of what labor is, does not bother to ask the question of how its products affect workers, so long as these are no longer at their disposal. It wishes to perceive only the progression of the exploitation of nature, not the regression of society. It already bears the technocratic traces which would later be found in Fascism. Among these is a concept of nature which diverges in a worrisome manner from those in the socialist utopias of the Vormaerz period [pre-1848]. Labor, as it is henceforth conceived, is tantamount to the exploitation of nature, which is contrasted to the exploitation of the proletariat with naïve self-satisfaction. Compared to this positivistic conception, the fantasies which provided so much ammunition for the ridicule of Fourier exhibit a surprisingly healthy sensibility. According to Fourier, a beneficent division of social labor would have the following consequences: four moons would illuminate the night sky; ice would be removed from the polar cap; saltwater from the sea would no longer taste salty; and wild beasts would enter into the service of human beings. All this illustrates a labor which, far from exploiting nature, is instead capable of delivering creations whose possibility slumbers in her womb. To the corrupted concept of labor belongs, as its logical complement, that nature which, as Dietzgen put it, “is there gratis [for free].”</p></blockquote>



<p>Our friends  are nowhere to be found within this system that creates murder and genocide under the banner of freedom, demockracy, and law. The conformism which enslaves everything ensures even that language is impoverished to its very meaning. Inverted; language completes our alienation within its womb of isolation from where we each wait for death to take us. Though we all know and are personally familiar with the capitalist machine’s exploitation, dislocation, drudgery, and terror; we still find ourselves say with a shrug, “I gotta pay my bills,” as we hear bones crunch under our step, the screams of the poor silenced with thuds of truncheons. We all are silent with guilt for participating and enforcing the apparatus which claims to serve us better, while the distinction between our enslavement and rule becomes so blurred that it is indistinguishable.</p>



<p>Blink.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sigh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mode of exploitation is so ingrained within all of us now, that we are all tainted with the virus of alienation from inception. With the same barbarism and monstrous greed which we exploit nature, we also exploit ourselves, each other, and our souls. Man has shown over the last several millennia that he not only is unfit fit to rule himself, but no one else either. The greatest care of the self become Messianic only in a world where our very being has been expropriated from the hollow name that is The Self.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To anonymize ourselves is to strip bare of the roles, identities, and laws we have been given in order to constitute something novel, spectacular, and new.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must keep in mind that if we empower the machines to liberate us, it is not to do our work. The extraordinary danger that we face from this technology is not from without, but within: we must never allow for our humanity to be lost again. Not even in the deepest confines of the digital, where our True Name is concealed and coincides with the private key, will we ever allow for the infinity of human creative and ingenuity of The Other to be locked away. Through this technology Novus Ordo Seclorum will bloom and the scent of freedom will rise from beneath the rancor of this world.</p>



<p>It is once we come to understand that our quest is for the restoration of a society which has always been [The Whatever], and must only be remembered, we will come upon Our Work as humans of this age. This is the work in which we are given our lives to live once again as our own, and which we can free ourselves from the banality of labor in capitalism. This is to open ourselves to The Real Work that is both our own, and what must be done if we are to survive the coming environmental catastrophe. We must recognizing that we are not the masters of the Earth to exploit it for gratis, but are stewards that understand all things belong to all people [omnia sunt communia].</p>



<p>We wish to only live, and the cost of that we will raise above all else.</p>



<p>This alone will cause for the vanquishment of the world we wish to dismiss. But in order to be able to create a new form-of-life from which life and liberty synonymous, we must consider that the time to act is upon us now, or the Gate will remain closed forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This door was made only for you. I will close it now.”</p>



<p>We must profane the past in order to open a new future from which freedom can reign. We wish to create a world in which our labor, our love, our life, and self-care can no longer be separated, but only honored through their fusion of our abandonment into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will find the power to create a new form-of-life here in this space and the kind of political which it demands. To birth our new world for our redemption through the creative power that only we can own, can only be found in our true hidden secret work which lies beyond the end of labor and exploitation, beyond the earth and the self, and into the ranks of all the ages. It is our purpose and why we were put on this earth at this time.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>12.</p><p>We need history, but we need it differently from the spoiled lazy-bones in the garden of knowledge.</p><cite>— Nietzsche, On the Use and Abuse of History for Life</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The subject of historical cognition is the battling, oppressed class itself. In Marx it steps forwards as the final enslaved and avenging class, which carries out the work of emancipation in the name of generations of downtrodden to its conclusion. This consciousness, which for a short time made itself felt in the “Spartacus” [Spartacist splinter group, the forerunner to the German Communist Party], was objectionable to social democracy from the very beginning. In the course of three decades it succeeded in almost completely erasing the name of Blanqui, whose distant thunder [Erzklang] had made the preceding century tremble. It contented itself with assigning the working-class the role of the savior of future generations. It thereby severed the sinews of its greatest power. Through this schooling the class forgot its hate as much as its spirit of sacrifice. For both nourish themselves on the picture of enslaved forebears, not on the ideal of the emancipated heirs.</p></blockquote>



<p>To see history as it really was outside of the narrative forced upon us, we see we are at the end of this long chain of historical cognition which seeks invariably for the enslavement of man under the yoke of state and law. We have the ever-increasing documentation of all the history of everything since the dawn of the internet to prove this point. Moving forward, the internet will continue to act as the l’ordre du jour ofall things — those who are vanquished today as Martyrs  or Monsters will be remembered for all of time as just that. As Keller says, the truth will not run away from us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heroes like Blanqui are men that completely refuse the weakness of our fate, and sought only after the Final Destiny of Man. He understood that at the present time the entire life of our planet, from birth until death, is being documented  day by day with all its crimes and misfortunes on a myriad of brother-stars, no matter which reality we are in. What we call progress is imprisoned on every earth, and fades away with each one as well. Always and everywhere in the terrestrial field the same drama, the same décor; on the same limited stage a boisterous humanity, infatuated with its greatness, believing itself to be the universe, and living in its prison as if it were immense spaces, only to soon fall along with the globe that carried — with the greatest disdain — the burden of its pride. The same monotony, the same immobility on foreign stars like our own, in alternative realities. The universe repeats itself endlessly and fidgets in place, returning back to the same steps to fulfill that which must be done. Eternity infinitely and imperturbably [imperturbabilis] acts out the same performance until the decision is made to walk into the Elysian fields and lay claim to the final destiny which was made only for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to enter the gate, and close the door is ours — we only need to make that final decision.</p>



<p>Our amnesic society has allowed for less than a century of technological progress of petty and rough things to obliterate our hatred and sacrifices that were made in the name of such ‘progress’. If we can remember the crimes of today for the generations of tomorrow, and to document them as such for when their moment of their Justice comes, we can put offerings to the hearth of not the revolution, but the Reformation. This will stoke this flames of wrath to which will ignite our God to move toward His Throne with an impertinence and fury which can right things as only Apocalyptic force could. We will nourish ourselves on this image of tomorrow, for the profanity of today.</p>



<blockquote><p>13.</p><p>Yet every day our cause becomes clearer and the people more clever.</p><cite>— Josef Dietzgen, Social Democratic Philosophy</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Social democratic theory, and still more the praxis, was determined by a concept of progress which did not hold to reality, but had a dogmatic claim. Progress, as it was painted in the minds of the social democrats, was once upon a time the progress of humanity itself (not only that of its abilities and knowledges). It was, secondly, something unending (something corresponding to an endless perfectibility of humanity). It counted, thirdly, as something essentially unstoppable (as something self-activating, pursuing a straight or spiral path). Each of these predicates is controversial, and critique could be applied to each of them. This latter must, however, when push comes to shove, go behind all these predicates and direct itself at what they all have in common. The concept of the progress of the human race in history is not to be separated from the concept of its progression through a homogenous and empty time. The critique of the concept of this progress must ground the basis of its critique on the concept of progress itself.</p></blockquote>



<p>Simply because we progress forward into time does not mean human society has been progressing towards a more perfect society; in fact, quite the opposite. If we contemplate the messianic standpoint, the greatest progress that can occur is for the complete fall of humanity, and the welcomed rule of the Anti-Christ. However, The Fall cannot come about simply because the next moment has came; it must be part of the greater katechontic reveling of the horrors of history; the barbarism of society; the truth of man to himself.</p>



<p>It is only from this space of accepting responsibility for all of the ills that have fallen upon man, that the conditions for the return of the Messiah can be met: to bring about the end of times through the cessation of this &#8216;progress&#8217; that is anything but. To forsake the profane, and seek redemption from a progress which has sacrificed the very life of man in the name of its one true profit.</p>



<blockquote><p>14.</p><p>Origin is the goal [Ziel: terminus].</p><cite>— Karl Kraus, Worte in Versen I [Words in Verse]</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>History is the object of a construction whose place is formed not in homogenous and empty time, but in that which is fulfilled by the here-and-now [Jetztzeit]. For Robespierre, Roman antiquity was a past charged with the here-and-now, which he exploded out of the continuum of history. The French revolution thought of itself as a latter day Rome. It cited ancient Rome exactly the way fashion cites a past costume. Fashion has an eye for what is up-to-date, wherever it moves in the jungle [Dickicht: maze, thicket] of what was. It is the tiger’s leap into that which has gone before. Only it takes place in an arena in which the ruling classes are in control. The same leap into the open sky of history is the dialectical one, as Marx conceptualized the revolution.</p></blockquote>



<p>We create providence in the here-and-now; our volition alone is that which fills into the purportedly empty time (that is anything but) which we are falling into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some choose not to fall at all, but dive instead.</p>



<p>This is how Augustus came to Rule the known ancient world with Arcana Imperii. He saw that it was not a secret, but a fact which was empowered by its very bloody seal, of which he used his own life as a token to change the rules of the machine. Power did not need to be given, but refused; for power is what he already had. </p>



<p>The fascination with social media and the secrets it contains are a mere foreshadowing of the world to come. It should be no wonder that people pled before the court of Twitter and Facebook like that of being before their own sovereign nation to deliver truth, which in turn allows for some form of justice to be demanded. </p>



<p>It is this power which we seek to entice, to empower, and to take command.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>15.</p><p>The consciousness of exploding the continuum of history is peculiar to the revolutionary classes in the moment of their action. The Great Revolution introduced a new calendar. The day on which the calendar started functioned as a historical time-lapse camera. And it is fundamentally the same day which, in the shape of holidays and memorials, always returns. The calendar does not therefore count time like clocks. They are monuments of a historical awareness, of which there has not seemed to be the slightest trace for a hundred years. Yet in the July Revolution an incident took place which did justice to this consciousness. During the evening of the first skirmishes, it turned out that the clock-towers were shot at independently and simultaneously in several places in Paris. An eyewitness who may have owed his inspiration to the rhyme wrote at that moment:</p><p>Qui le croirait! on dit,<br>&nbsp;qu’irrités contre l’heure<br>&nbsp;De nouveaux Josués<br>&nbsp;au pied de chaque tour,<br>&nbsp;Tiraient sur les cadrans<br>&nbsp;pour arrêter le jour.</p><p>[Who would’ve thought! As though<br>&nbsp;Angered by time’s way<br>&nbsp;The new Joshuas<br>&nbsp;Beneath each tower, they say<br>&nbsp;Fired at the dials<br>&nbsp;To stop the day.]</p></blockquote>



<p>There is another space and time where the revolution is a truth. Time here, as we understand it, is charged in a different way. Kairos is master here. For each second represents a new form of time, and eternity of the moment, where all hangs to be poured over again, and again, instituting its own glory by the very nature that man is a temporal thing. The signature of this hidden power is found in the determination to create a new form of time which signals the change of one epoch to the next.</p>



<p>The Great Revolution takes place in the space and time in which one personally knows the bodily sensation of totalizing own’s own life into single moments which crystalize in the glory of the face of death. The transcendental connection to those who had so valiantly came before us, and those who will perish after us, have the same bodily sensations which impels one to tremble with passion, or prattle with terror for the same reason. We are brothers and sisters united by our cause in the whole continuum of history; though set apart in linear time, and the particular glory of our cause, we are together in the passion of the moment which is the culmination of our history as it truly was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We choose the glory to go to Elysium and to close the Door of Law now in order to go back to the country, the Arcadia from which we came.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>16.</p><p>The historical materialist cannot do without the concept of a present which is not a transition, in which time originates and has come to a standstill. For this concept defines precisely the present in which he writes history for his person. Historicism depicts the “eternal” picture of the past; the historical materialist, an experience with it, which stands alone. He leaves it to others to give themselves to the whore called “Once upon a time” in the bordello of historicism. He remains master of his powers: man enough, to explode the continuum of history.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historical materialist see themselves as the product of all that has been and all that is to come — they see the infinite story that will be told again, and again, over, and over, until the story comes to it natural fruition of revolutionary explosion in which the eschatological moment is seized. Each generation is given this possibility. He see the single point in which he stands as the fulcrum into eternity, where time arrests and dissolves into the prophecy as it was foretold. Revolution is a drama more than a history, and its pathos is a condition as imperious as its authenticity.</p>



<p>The danger of historicism is the believing the religious tale that freezes history and renders it blind to what really was, not its existence itself. We need a free lover who hodls the secrets of tantra to afford us the experience of love as an act of self-care which can redeem us from this place. We need love as an action, not a fantasy. It is only with our utmost familiarity with the Magdalenes of the bordellos do the true secrets of god decrypt themselves to us.</p>



<p>This form of love can decrypt the lies of men — of authority, of money, of power, of language itself. Love decrypts these thing to understand the history and facts of men which makes the world. It is under the bludgeoned of their encrypted fiction that we will find the tale of a past given by historicism, and how it betrays itself by the nature of what it represents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This historical materialist understands that his greatest power is to reveal the final truth in order to empower the past to explode the continuum of history into it final eternal moment into which all things can be weighed, judged, and resolved. Historicism as it really was always knew these things to be true, it just needs the final chapter to align the constellations into position.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>17.</p><p>Historicism justifiably culminates in universal history. Nowhere does the materialist writing of history distance itself from it more clearly than in terms of method. The former has no theoretical armature. Its method is additive: it offers a mass of facts, in order to fill up a homogenous and empty time. The materialist writing of history for its part is based on a constructive principle. Thinking involves not only the movement of thoughts but also their zero-hour [Stillstellung]. Where thinking suddenly halts in a constellation overflowing with tensions, there it yields a shock to the same, through which it crystallizes as a monad. The historical materialist approaches a historical object solely and alone where he encounters it as a monad. In this structure he cognizes the sign of a messianic zero-hour [Stillstellung] of events, or put differently, a revolutionary chance in the struggle for the suppressed past. He perceives it, in order to explode a specific epoch out of the homogenous course of history; thus exploding a specific life out of the epoch, or a specific work out of the life-work. The net gain of this procedure consists of this: that the life-work is preserved and sublated in the work, the epoch in the life-work, and the entire course of history in the epoch. The nourishing fruit of what is historically conceptualized has time as its core, its precious but flavorless seed.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historicism is the culmination of all facts into one cohesive story — it is the data mining and synthesizing of all information towards a single, universal truth. The power of this method is in its agnosticism, while at the same time it inhibits its own ability to distinguish great events from small, as it is just data. While the materialist is still within the structuring of the story of time, he must assemble the facts to create the conception of a final-hour, a time in which all things can be righted, and the prophecies fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where thinking seizes, only actions can fill the void to fulfill the prophecy. It is in these moment that have been vanquished again, and again by the powers that be that are charged with the same conditions for The Chosen One to always be able to enter The Gates. It is through stringing all of these events together, showing how they will happen over and over again, being repeated infinitely until the Messiah come; is that which affords the opportunity to explode this epoch and finally close the door of the law from the city of men, once and for all.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>18.</p><p>“In relation to the history of organic life on Earth,” notes a recent biologist, “the miserable fifty millennia of homo sapiens represents something like the last two seconds of a twenty-four hour day. The entire history of civilized humanity would, on this scale, take up only one fifth of the last second of the last hour.” The here-and-now, which as the model of messianic time summarizes the entire history of humanity into a monstrous abbreviation, coincides to a hair with the figure, which the history of humanity makes in the universe.</p></blockquote>



<p>It is by no mistake that Man is the most powerful he has ever been, and that it coincides with the most abhorrent travesties and barbarism beyond anything that could have ever been imagined before the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is something that we all know in our heart of hearts: that things could have been different. That we could live not only without hunger or fear, but freely with Libertas and Joy. And yet, at the same time — and all over the world — the social apparatus has become so hardened that what lies before us as a means of possible fulfillment presents itself as radically impossible.</p>



<p>It is only once we totally abandon the known forms of life and politics, and seek within ourselves the secret that the existence of another form-of-life could be true, that we will open the possibility of the Coming Community and the possibility of a kingdom of heaven on this earth in our life time.&nbsp;</p>







<blockquote><p>Addendum:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>A.</p><p>Historicism contents itself with establishing a causal nexus of various moments of history. But no state of affairs is, as a cause, already a historical one. It becomes this, posthumously, through eventualities which may be separated from it by millennia. The historian who starts from this, ceases to permit the consequences of eventualities to run through the fingers like the beads of a rosary. He records [erfasst] the constellation in which his own epoch comes into contact with that of an earlier one. He thereby establishes a concept of the present as that of the here-and-now, in which splinters of messianic time are shot through.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historicism is the facts of history as they are encrypted to their very being. However, the key is not lost. Through the posthumous keen observation towards the past, counting the events as rosary, with each one connecting itself to the greater constellation  of the immensity it contains, the focus of everything changes as the scrutiny intensifies. This coming into focus produces the real heros as they really were. Though vanquished and forgotten to their own, their story awaits the test of time, to be retold through the connection to our own here-and-now. Each event and the Truth it contains creates another star in our constellation which can lead the way through the dark night. With each star that is counted another bead is pasted in the rosary, the splintered shards of the mirror are gathered to reflect the same infinite image, offering themselves towards the summoning of the final moment of this time.</p>



<p>This is how we find our way out.</p>



<blockquote><p>B.</p><p>Surely the time of the soothsayers, who divined what lay hidden in the lap of the future, was experienced neither as homogenous nor as empty. Whoever keeps this in mind will perhaps have an idea of how past time was experienced as remembrance: namely, just the same way. It is well-known that the Jews were forbidden to look into the future. The Torah and the prayers instructed them, by contrast, in remembrance. This disenchanted those who fell prey to the future, who sought advice from the soothsayers. For that reason the future did not, however, turn into a homogenous and empty time for the Jews. For in it every second was the narrow gate, through which the Messiah could enter.</p></blockquote>



<p>What was time like before modernity and the regimented ticking of the clock? In no way did all time have its measurement, homogeneity, or distance — there would only be the memory, or longing of what had been. Holidays to remember, celebrations to be had, and moments of only life to be recounted. The morning differed from the evening, as much as day differed from night; time itself was the precious gem that was life itself. We only have one life which we can live, and we are still waiting with the gate of Law before us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gate is narrow, but it was made for only for our refusal, and only for Mahdi to close, and to welcome the Messiah into the home of the country, the private lives of our hearts.</p>



<p>I Tego Arcana Dei.</p>

  <p>Yes, your argument is based on defining inflation/deflation around price levels instead of changes in the money supply. This is an intentional distinction I chose to make because simply using price levels obscures the fact that prices can change because of productivity and money supply. Instead, I separate the two and focus on deflation strictly in a money supply sense to keep a clear picture.</p>♦

The term was first used by the Etruscans. Originally it meant the period of time from the moment that something happened (for example the founding of a city) until the point in time that all people who had lived at the first moment had died. At that point a new saeculum would start. According to legend, the gods had allotted a certain number of saecula to every people or civilization; the Etruscans themselves, for example, had been given ten saecula.</blockquote><blockquote>Wikipedia — Saeculum</blockquote>♦Late Millennial Saeculum bitcoin chart (2018) viewed with Early Millennial Saeculum binoculars (1917)What Hath Satoshi Wrought<p>I’ll admit that I found the line to be a little sacrilegious.

  <blockquote><p>“The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “emergency situation” in which we live is the rule. We must arrive at a concept of history which corresponds to this. Then it will become clear that the task before us is the introduction of a real state of emergency; and our position in the struggle against Fascism will thereby improve.”</p><cite>-Walter Benjamin, On the Concept of History</cite></blockquote>







<p>This is the modified second half of a longer essay, The Sovereign, the Subject, and Crypto-power: Life in the Digital Panopticon.</p>







<p>Cryptography is first and foremost a technique of war.  </p>



<p>It is the final individual decision to protect one&#8217;s privacy and data beyond any laws, any violence, any war. </p>



<p>The history of computers is the history of cryptanalysis, which in turn is the history of the tactical development of communication under the conditions of total unbracketed war. Asymmetric cryptography is the culmination of the understanding of the phenomenon of “bellum omnium contra omnes” and offers a kind of science to which men can ‘protect themselves, when none else can protect them,’ and most importantly is solidified ‘by no covenant be relinquished.’ (Hobbes ¶ 21.21)</p>



<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of the personal struggle for life, liberty, and wealth against any and all governments that can only be called tyrannical. Bitcoin and the cryptography it entails offers every person a final kind of protection in the field of total unbracketed war where the term “bellum omnium contra omnes” offers its true decrypted meaning: each of us may become homo sacer at anytime for any reason. Nature opens the messianic path through the real state of emergency that is homo homini lupus and the infinite grotesque promise of what that should mean to each and every individual human today, and what Bitcoin offers as a response to it at each step. </p>



<p>Cryptography is the culmination of a cognition of history which recognizes the absolute value and totalizing nature of privacy in the theater of total war of all against all, and the respective role that privity takes in a field of total unbracketed war. In all systems of government, the possibility of a ‘state of emergency [ausnahmezustand]’ that will always create a &#8216;just war [jus bellum justum]&#8217; against ‘other [homo sacer]’ people who can be killed but not sacrificed, exploited but not robbed, and in bondage but not slaves; can always happen, and already is happening. This is a real possibility under any system of law, and is a hideous fact of the legal genocides, ethnic cleansing, and political expropriations of the 20th century. Crypto is a history which understands the infinite violence that all sovereign powers have entitled themselves to for ‘final solution’ of legal means against man, nature, and life as we know it at all cost — including the rule of law itself. </p>



<p>It is once we understand that our political problems are first economic problems that our position in the struggle against global panoptic fascism will vastly improve. It is through this understanding that we will find the only path towards our exit and the freedom that is intended for only us. </p>



The Final Decision of Cryptography



<blockquote><p>“The sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” </p><cite>— Carl Schmitt</cite></blockquote>



<p>Crypto commands the code alone to be sovereign.</p>



<p>There is no exception to this. There are no laws that can change this fact, nor any amount of violence that can modify it either. </p>



<p>Due to this explicit fact that digital expressions exist solely in the realm of  non-physical space through mathematical expression alone, it can never be subjugated to the same physical forces that legal and authoritarian rule must always entail. Crypto leaves no remainder for any kind of exception.</p>



<p>Crypto is subject only to the laws of mathematics alone&#8211;NOT men, institutions, or governments. </p>



<p>If you think otherwise then come and break it!</p>



<p>There is no sovereign exception, nor can there be one. The vicious magnanimity and imperium to which cryptography holds mathematics as its only sacrosant allows for it to consecrate the glory of a singular Spinozian God [Deus sive Natura] to whom there are no exceptions within his machine of mathematics, his immanent laws of the universe, and His passion for a form of common-wealth that is beyond the power of any group of men. Bitcoin is the resounding thunder of an idea whose time has come, and that cannot be stopped.</p>



<blockquote><p>What we need, however, is a political philosophy that isn’t erected around the problem of sovereignty, nor therefore around the problems of law and prohibition. We need to cut off the King’s head: in political theory that has still to be done.</p><cite>&#8211;Foucault, Truth and Power</cite></blockquote>



<p>Crypto presents a political theory which decapitates the sovereign&#8217;s head with the resounding declaration of fiat justitia, et pereat mundus [Let justice be done lest the world perish]. </p>



<p>Crypto does this by not engaging the the classic stratagem of law, prohibition, and sovereignty that all law demands; but something totally novel and new. Crypto engages in a radically new system of common-wealth and digital social contract by using cryptography as the base technique of this new form of organization. Through this a new political form-of-life, where all people can have their wealth be protected from any form of violence through the power of cryptography; a messianic possibility is opened. The crisis of money becomes apocalyptic, and an existential threat to all nation-states today. It is the final emergency that cannot be stopped, and opens humanity to the final epoch where man may take his final dignified place as the ruler of himself, by himself, for himself alone. </p>



<p>This allows for something that all people, everywhere, whether they admit it or not, know in their heart of hearts: that things could be different, that radical economic, social, and political change is a real possibility. We could live not only without hunger, but also probably without fear, and freely as well. And yet, at the same time — and all over the world — the social apparatus has become so hardened and calcified that what lies before us as a means of possible fulfillment presents itself as radically impossible.</p>



<p>Together we must choose to make the collective decision to create the real and final state of emergency that will be the final existential threat to the state and their fiat money. By refusing their corrupt money, hollow laws, and false idols we can make the world new again. Together we can choose to create a new form of social life, common-wealth, and legal system together that is outside and beyond the power of any state or government to destroy&#8211;only for them to submit to. </p>



<p>We can choose to create the foundation for a totally new form of political, social, and economic life that is the commonwealth and new social agreement for our time. With the power of cryptography we can guarantee the privacy, freedom, and liberty that was promised to only us; and that we intend to keep! No fascist decrees, no communist appropriations, no state of emergency from any political banner can stop us! The struggle is real and we will not stop until fiat money is destroyed and the state and money are totally separated as they should to be. </p>



<p>Together we can deactivate fiat money, state law, and shatter the paradise of legal violence and authoritarianism in order to consummate a new form of economic, social, and political life. A life that is beyond the power of any state to destroy, any laws to litigate, and any violence to violated. The state will try to destroy it, and with each blow that they will deliver, crypto will only get stronger. It will prove its inviolable nature more resoundingly, blow by blow, while also showing just how corrupt, wicked, and evil those in positions of legal and state power really are. </p>



<blockquote><p>The sovereign is the point of indistinction between violence and law, the threshold on which violence passes over into law and law passes over into violence.</p><cite>— Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer</cite></blockquote>



<p>Through a glitch in the matrix that creates the image of sovereign power through its physical form; we also find the Achilles’ heel from which there is an opening to create Leviathan’s downfall. Leviathan must always have a physical foothold from where he can display his power, a body to which make an example of his sovereign violence. </p>



<p>However, sovereign power cannot actualize the law if it does not have a physical space to render violence within. It needs a physical body it can identify first, so it may subject, dehumanize and objectify in order to display its legal and physical power. If legal power cannot find a physical body or space in which it can carry out it punishment, it risks displaying the incapacity of the law without violence, the sovereign without his subject, the emperor without clothes.</p>



<p>The secret is that the sovereign is as blind as the rest of us if it cannot see. </p>



Blinding the Sovereign 



<blockquote><p>The State is superstructural in relation to a whole series of power networks, that invest the body, sexuality, the family, kinship, knowledge, technology and so forth. True, these networks stand in a conditioning-conditioned relationship to a kind of ‘meta-power’ which is structured essentially round a certain number of great prohibition functions; but this meta-power with its prohibitions can only take hold and secure its footing where it is rooted in a whole series of multiple and indefinite power relations that supply the necessary basis for the great negative forms of power.&nbsp;</p><cite>&#8211;Foucault, Truth and Power</cite></blockquote>



<p>In order for legal power to secure a footing, the first engagement of power must be one of identification. Through identification, the physical form can be found, and power projected on to the subject in any of the nearly infinite techniques the panopticon can use to project the gaze and its power on the subject. Once identified, the process of selection can begin. The subject can then be labeled as ‘friend’ for inclusion in the camps, or &#8216;enemy&#8217; for isolation, destruction, and liquidation. However, through the digital, which can only and explicitly be expressed in non-physical medium, there is a territory in which the subject can abscond into a total anonymous existence of its own creating. In making the final turn away from the panoptic machine, and giving oneself entirely as anonymous citizen of the digital cosmos, man once again finds the ideals from which he can create the new order of the ages once again.</p>



<p>Through using cryptography to create a novel and fair economic game of wealth common to all, bitcoin rediscovered the sovereign power that is hidden at the center of what a commonwealth really is: The commonality of wealth to all, with no one able to control or change the system for the betterment of some at the cost of others. In other words, it is commonality of law itself, for the system to recognize each of us equally. The capacity and demand for law to remain totally neutral, and blind through the anonymous functions of cryptography ensures complete and open access for everyone. No matter one&#8217;s station of birth, creed of faith, or political identity according to the state; Bitcoin can give you equal access to this new law that is defined by its blockchain. </p>



<p>With this radical new power of peace, man finds himself back at the start of all political concept once again. However, this time man emerges from the forest of technology armed with the final weapon of cryptography and the mask of anonymity of which hides the face of the messianic possibility it contains. Man has renewed the opportunity to liberate himself from the concentration camps of modernity; but this time for good, permanently, and forever.  By using the power of cryptography to banish information from identify, controlling, and subjecting us; we create the new nomos for humanity. </p>



<p>Through bonding our political destinies with with the science of cryptographic protocols and consummating with the machine directly; we can create a new form of common-wealth, law, and power. It is the commonwealth of crypto which will open the next and final epoch for all of humanity and posterity, and what the promise of a money freed from the vestiges of statism, debt, and fiat money looks like. Through the personal choice to totally objectify oneself via code, and giving oneself to it entirely for the protection that it offers when no other sovereign can; the commonwealth of cryptography open the polis to man once again. </p>



<p>Through giving ourselves over to the power of cryptography and the majesty and imperium to which it will always hodl; we find the power to create a real form polis through the encrypted internet. Here we have found the power to open the final hour in which state legal power can be deactivated, and all people may be free from it for good. Peace on this earth is not such a radical ideal if we all have the power/knowledge of cryptography at our fingertips, and how to use such a power to protect our lives, our wealth, our honor, our freedom, and our privacy. </p>



<p>Through accepting crypto as a political cause and sovereign power, any human may free and liberate their wealth, privacy, and liberty from the state and fiat slavery once again. With the true nature of what the common-wealth of law rediscovered, magnus ab integro seclorum nascitur ordo (the great series of ages begins anew). </p>



<p>It is the political and theological destiny of all of humanity in the final hour, the final emergency, for all legal systems to shipwreck themselves on the reef of ethics which no decision can avoid. Each ship designed with the same flaw of the rudder of sovereignty; each one damned to the same mutinied destination no matter the pitch, speed, or weight. We are each free to abandon the ship of the camps now, free to swim back to the country from which we came, where we will no longer be before the law. </p>



<blockquote><p>“One day humanity will play with law just as children play with disused objects, not in order to restore them to their canonical use but to free them from it for good.”</p><cite>— Giorgio Agamben</cite></blockquote>

  &#8220;What does it matter who is speaking,&#8221; someone said, &#8220;what matters is who is speaking.&#8221;



<p>That’s the entire point.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a totally new concept was developed where scientific texts were accepted on their own merits and positioned within an anonymous and coherent conceptual system of established truths and methods of verification. Authentication no<br> longer required reference to the individual who had produced them;<br> the role of the author disappeared as an index of truthfulness and,<br> where it remained as an inventor&#8217;s name, it was merely to denote a<br> specific theorem or proposition, a strange effect, a property, a body, a<br> group of elements, or pathological syndrome.</p><cite>Michel Foucault, What is an Author? [bold mine]</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Spectre that Satoshi Nakamoto represents — a single human being intransigently choosing the protection of cryptography against a seemingly omnipotent global government machine hell-bent on controlling all wealth, information, and identity no matter what — is a far greater power than any money he created; but is the very legend that he and Bitcoin is. Through creating a character that we only know as this amorphous, pseudonymous, nonphysical &#8216;person&#8217;&#8211;the idea that is Satoshi Nakamoto&#8211;and his great work that he introduced into the world&#8211;Bitcoin&#8211;Satoshi was really telling a much greater story about wealth, identity, and power in the arc of human history. When one reads all the details of this hidden story about a man and his passion for a new form of wealth that is beyond any temporal power; we discover the tale of cryptosovereignty and the extraordinary individual power that is cryptography, and Bitcoin in this world. </p>



<p>As time builds between Satoshi&#8217;s last appearance in our world and the inoperetivity that is his task of Bitcoin; so too will the legend of who he is, and the ramification of what he has done. And as this legend grows and becomes known by all of humankind, it will transmogrify beyond just a legend and into the fabric of history itself. As the very foundation of fiat money and panoptic surveillance comes to tremble before the name Satoshi Nakamoto, the reality of his task will be too palpable for anyone to deny. </p>



<p>With each ludicrous attempt to identify Satoshi, as we saw with Dorian, or  the fraudulent, lying, despicable sack of shit that is CSW, or any of those other fuck-ups who have tried to claim to be him; the legend of Satoshi will only grow stronger. Now only a cryptographic signature from the genesis block will suffice to verify that Satoshi is who he is. Anything short of that will always leave space for it to be questioned, for Satoshi to remain hidden. I believe in all of his brilliance and glory Satoshi threw those private keys into the abyss, sealing his fate as the author of the greatest work of art that has ever been created; while dooming his project to the final, inevitable conclusion that it and the world must come to. </p>



<p>For the deepest truth of what Satoshi had to teach us was &#8216;what does it matter who is speaking, someone said, what matters is who is speaking.&#8216; </p>



<p>Through the glory, grace, and dignity of whoever Satoshi Nakamoto may be, the one thing that is for certain is they are of the greatest character and class of any human that there has been. And it is not for the achievement that is Bitcoin, the extraordinary power that is unlocking this new epoch, nor even for the monumental amount of exogenesis wealth it will create; but for his very human choice to walk away. </p>



<p>Through this action alone Satoshi may very well pass himself from being just a legend to something so much more extraordinary and audacious: </p>



<p>Hope.</p>



<p>Real hope. </p>



<p>For something new. For something different. For something fair. </p>



<p>By refusing to reveal who he is, refusing to expose his wealth, and by making the final decision to remain as only the author of Bitcoin, and nothing more; he has moved himself from the human realm into that of the Elysium itself. </p>



<p>By maintaining his image as a Being that is beyond this place of wrath and tears, past the gridding and guilt that is now our very physical faces and existence, and past the shame and injustice that is the history of all fiat money; Satoshi&#8217;s work has opened the narrow path from which we can escape the camps of modren life. Just as in the darkest of nights does the smallest of lights shine the brightest, so too does Bitcoin present itself here on this earth today. </p>



<p>The creation of Bitcoin was a task chosen for only him/them/it alone, and the role was played perfectly to the task. Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto may be, they are clearly the greatest hero of the 21st century, and quite possibility even the great liberator of humanity itself. Only time will tell how great and how vast the legend of Satoshi Nakamoto will grow to be, and how glorious his project of Bitcoin will become; but one thing is for certain and that is this:</p>



<p>Satoshi has given us hope. </p>



<p>By refusing the greatest sum of money that any person has ever created, by keeping his face concealed and beyond the power of any state or person to identify, and by choosing to walk away from one of the most extraordinary project that humanity has ever known; Satoshi has proven his imperium and sovereignty through cryptography.  Through his being as an author alone, he has displayed the power that any of us can have access to when we choose to use the power of cryptography to protect ourselves, and the promise that will always entail. Through his task of Bitcoin and the Good News that it is, he has given each one of us the gift for to choose for ourselves what the real meaning of value, wealth, and law is. </p>



<p>In this final action of walking away, and taking his death upon himself, Satoshi closed the Gate of Law as his final move and checkmate to forbid any state from interloping in our land, and allow us an opportunity to abscond back to the country from which we came so we may be free once again. </p>







<p>Epilogue:</p>



<p>It is said that after Satoshi stopped working on Bitcoin that he found a job as a scrivener lost somewhere down on Wall Street. Today he still sits there, as Bartleby once did, confounding financiers, economist, lawyers, and all sorts of reasonable men alike with his intransigency, and decision to refuse to go along with anything. It is said that he was a most unreasonable man and his only response to any question was:</p>



&#8220;I would prefer not to.&#8221;







<blockquote><p>“If Bartleby is a new Messiah, he comes not, like Jesus, to redeem what was, but to save what was not. The Tartarus into which Bartleby, the new savior, descends is the deepest level of the Palace of Destinies, that whose sight Leibniz cannot tolerate, the world in which nothing is compossible with anything else, where &#8220;nothing exists rather than something.”</p><cite>― Giorgio Agamben</cite></blockquote>

<p>Su and I have recently joined Deribit, a cryptocurrency futures &amp; options exchange. </p>



<p>At Deribit, we will build out a new research publication called Deribit Insights, following in the footsteps of excellent publications like BitMEX Research, Circle Research (now closed down), and Binance Research. </p>



<p>We retain editorial control and will publish one new report every week. </p>



<p>If you enjoyed reading our articles on Medium and Uncommon Core, nothing changes for you &#8211; except that we will publish a lot more frequently now!</p>



<p>In fact, our first two reports are already out:</p>



<p></p>



Crypto derivatives exchanges are liquidation pioneers



<p>The invention of auto-liquidation has enabled the rise of global and permissionless trading.  We show how different exchanges have implemented this mechanism and how they could further harden it against market manipulation.  (Read the full report)</p>



<p></p>



A New Sidechain Design for Bitcoin



<p>The idea of sidechains has promised scalability, finality, privacy, and richer state to Bitcoin users. This promise largely didn&#8217;t materialize. In this week&#8217;s  Insights report, we analyze a new custodian design that requires less trust from Bitcoin users.  (Read the full report)</p>



<p></p>







<p></p>



<p>While most of our larger posts will be on Deribit Insights, we don&#8217;t intend to give up on UCC. It&#8217;s just a matter of finding a new place for it. Maybe we will use it for posts that are too long for Twitter but too short for a research report, as well as for more general updates. Stay tuned.</p>

<p>An application or protocol is secure if it realizes its goal in an adversarial environment. In the case of Bitcoin, the goal is to establish a payment system where anyone can participate, only the rightful owner can spend a coin, and all valid transactions make it into the ledger eventually.</p>



<p>For the first ten years of its existence, Bitcoin has successfully held these security properties. At the same time, academia has largely failed to replicate Bitcoin’s empirical soundness in their models, giving birth to the meme that “Bitcoin is secure in practice, but not in theory.” With this paper, we want to bridge the gap between theory and practice by introducing our model of Bitcoin’s security.</p>



<p>We show that Bitcoin can currently tolerate a very high incentive to attack, formalizing the intuition that the incentives of miners are long-term aligned with the system. The key insight is that mining requires a large upfront investment (typically a full year of mining rewards) whose value is tied to the health of the network. Any behavior that hurts the value of these coins before they have been delivered is highly destructive, showing why many of the attacks feared by academics are indeed irrational in practice.</p>



<p>In the second half, we show that, more than any external attacker, the biggest threat to Bitcoin’s security is baked into the protocol itself. The block subsidy schedule, which declines as part of Bitcoin’s fixed emission schedule, will lead to lower commitment from miners. If a robust blockspace market doesn’t develop, we explain why a decline in block rewards poses a substantial risk for the future. Contrary to popular belief, users can’t compensate for this by simply waiting for more confirmations.

  On-Chain Metrics Show Highly Uneven Token Distributions Across ERC20s♦<p>TL;DR We integrated four different on–chain distribution metrics for ERC20 tokens that are now available on studio.glassnode.com. These metrics are Percent Supply in Smart Contracts, 1% Richlist Balance, Gini Coefficient, and Herfindahl Index. An analysis of these metrics across 73 ERC20 tokens shows that, generally speaking, tokens are unevenly distributed across network addresses. For instance, on average the richest 1% addresses hold 83.2% of funds held by externally owned addresses.</p><blockquote>You can access all distribution metrics presented here on Glassnode Studio.</blockquote><p>On–chain data gives insight into the underlying state and activity of decentralised networks. One interesting aspect is analysing and understanding how funds are distributed across stakeholders, with the objective of quantifying to what extent assets are evenly spread across network participants or in the hands of only a few.</p><p>The common approach is to look at all addresses within the network and the amount of funds they hold at any given point in time (their balance), and how that balance relates to the total circulating supply.</p><p>At Glassnode we’ve done detailed on–chain distribution analyses of ERC20 tokens in the past, in particular for BAT and LINK. As a subsequent step we now aimed at implementing metrics that represent the distribution of a token as a single number, making it easy to track over time and allowing to compare tokens.</p><p>Therefore, we’ve added live versions of four distribution metrics for ERC20 tokens, that are available on Glassnode Studio and through our API as of today. These metrics are Percent Supply in Smart Contracts, Richlist Balance, Gini Coefficient, and Herfindahl Index.</p><p>In the following I will introduce these metrics and present an analysis where we looked at all 73 different ERC20 tokens currently supported on the Glassnode platform in order to obtain a general assessment of token distribution in the ERC20 ecosystem.</p>The Methodology<p>Before defining the metrics, it is important to note how we filter addresses that go into the computation of the 1% Richlist Balance, Gini Coefficient, and Herfindahl Index.</p><p>First, we only take into consideration Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs). This, in turn, means that we discard all smart contract addresses. The reason is simple: We want to obtain a metric that tells us how assets that are held by actual (external) users of the network, not funds from many individuals that are being held together in a single smart contract address. In order to obtain full picture and the amount of the total supply that is being discarded in these three distribution metrics, we also implemented a metric that gives the percent of supply in smart contracts.</p><p>Second, we discard addresses that we have flagged as “special”. These are asset-specific addresses and include for instance team accounts, ICO addresses, or other special accounts that are part of the token’s conceptual design and utility, and which hold funds that are owned by more that one person.</p><p>Finally, we also drop exchange addresses. These are, obviously, cold and hot exchange wallets that hold tokens from many different individuals and which would distort the distribution results.</p><p>Note: Our list of flagged exchange addresses and asset-specific “special” addresses is constantly being improved and updated.</p>The MetricsPercent Supply in Smart Contracts<p>The supply of assets held in smart contracts is self-explanatory: It shows the percentage of the total supply of a token that is held in smart contracts. While it’s an interesting metric in its own right, it also provides the necessary information on the amount of supply that is being dropped to compute the other metrics presented here (which are based on Externally Owned Accounts only).</p><p>The amount of supply in contracts of the analysed tokens ranges all the way from essentially zero, up to 92% for CRO.</p>♦1% Richlist Balance<p>This is probably the easiest and most straight-forward distribution metric presented here: The 1% Richlist Balance is simply the percentage of the EOA supply that is held by the 1% richest addresses (with respect to the token). Hence, it is easy to interpret as it simply shows the amount of funds the richest 1% hold.</p><p>The following chart shows that the richest 1% addresses hold between 41% (CND) and almost 100% (AOA) of externally held funds — with a mean of ~83.2%. These numbers indicate a relative concentration of funds on a small number of addresses.</p>♦Gini Coefficient<p>The Gini Coefficient is a well known statistical measure for inequality in distributions. It has been traditionally used as a gauge of economic inequality, measuring income distribution among a country’s population. The coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing perfect inequality.</p><p>Hence, a token in which every address has the same balance would have a Gini Coefficient of 0. A token in which one address holds all the funds, while all others hold nothing, has a Gini Coefficient of 1.</p><p>Our analysis shows that, according to Gini, distribution of tokens is highly unequal. The average Gini Coefficient (as of October 2019) across all analysed tokens is 0.97.</p>♦Herfindahl Index<p>Finally, the Herfindahl Index is a common measure of market concentration and is originally used to determine market competitiveness. It is computed by squaring the market share of each company competing in a market and then summing the resulting numbers.</p><p>Here, we experimentally adapted the Herfindahl Index as a metric of concentration of funds within addresses in the network. Thus, the “market” in our case is the total EOA supply, and the “market share” is the relative balance of each address with respect to the EOA supply. Hence, the Herfindahl Index provides us with a single number representing token concentration across addresses in the network.</p><p>The Herfindahl Index ranges between 0 and 1: A large score indicates high concentration of supply, whereas a small score is an indicator for more evenly distributed funds across addresses. In particular, the Herfindahl Index is useful for the identification of tokens in which a single address/entity owns a predominant amount of the token (a monopoly).</p><p>Our results show that the Herfindahl Index is — compared to the 1% Richlist Balance and the Gini Coefficient — the most dispersed, covering the complete interval between 0 and 1 with CND on the lower end (0.002) and VERI on the upper end (0.96).</p>♦Objections<p>There are a couple objections to the presented metrics and analyses that we want to address.</p><p>1) “One address does not necessarily map to one user — one user can have many addresses”</p><p>This is a common and very valid objection to the proposed methodology. Nonetheless, that fact that one user can control multiple addresses is one that we are willing to tolerate, because the reported results hold true regardless. If anything, handling the fact that a user can have multiple addresses would only skew the distributions even more and emphasise our results showing highly non-uniform distributions. In our opinion, it is much more important to correctly account for addresses that hold funds of many different users.</p><p>2) “It is unfair to discard smart contract balances — these can make up a large part of the total supply”</p><p>We’re aware that dropping smart contract addresses doesn’t paint the full picture. However, there are good reasons to actually discard them. First, including smart contracts that hold funds from many different stakeholders, would distort the results of the distribution metrics — a trade-off we did not want to make (see the first objection). Of course there are ways to separate the funds in smart contracts to different owners, however this is an approach we did not find to be scalable at this point, therefore we approached this pragmatically. Second, we are interested in these token distributions from the perspective of an investor and trader. And tokens that are being traded, are usually held in EOAs (exception: DEXs). Spotting tokens that are highly concentrated and held by only a few external addresses can be an immediate red flag to invest or trade a particular token. Therefore, looking at EOAs alone is a valuable approach.</p><p>3) “It is an unfair comparison, the distribution of funds depends also on the utility of the token, which is different for all”</p><p>This objection is one that can be true for the analyses presented here — not for the metrics themselves though. You can use the these metrics on a single token basis, in order to evaluate how the token evolves over time with respect to its distribution and assess its current state. You don’t necessarily need to use these metrics in order to compare and/or rank tokens.</p>Conclusion<p>We implemented four different metrics to assess the distribution of ERC20 tokens across Externally Owned Addresses in the Ethereum network: Percent Supply in Smart Contracts, 1% Richlist Balance, Gini Coefficient, and Herfindahl Index. While the first simply gives the ratio of funds held in smart contracts vs EOAs, the other three metrics are a different attempts to measure how evenly funds are distributed across network addresses.</p><p>According to the 1% Richlist Balance and Gini, our analyses across 73 different ERC20 tokens show that generally tokens are unequally distributed, while the Herfindahl Index paints a more neutral picture on the concentration of funds in network addresses. The interpretability and the choice of metric that most accurately represent the distribution of tokens in the network is left to the reader.

  How Anarchism Without Adjectives Can Point Towards a Method of Unifying&nbsp;Crypto



<p>Anarchism without adjectives was a form of anarchism developed in the late 19th century a few decades after anarchism split with communism in 1872 over authoritarianism and the use of the state in creating a stateless  society. While anarchist were unified in their idea of a stateless society and the need to create it without the state, there was no consensus on how this was to be done, so a number schisms developed within anarchist movement itself. From individualist anarchist, to anarcho-syndicalist and anarcho-communist, there were many different flavors of what a stateless society could look like under the banners of anarchism. In response to the petty narcissism of small differences between various anarchists, anarchism without adjectives rejected specific forms of anarchism for a synthesis of operable praxis. It wanted to focus on what worked, rather than the ideology of what they thought would work. </p>



<p>The great advantage of this strategy is it creates a revolutionary front through the praxis of revolutionism first. It synthesizes all revolutionary tendencies, solidifying them into a primacy of solidarity around the organization of the revolutionary struggle itself. This is how the I.W.W. one of the largest and most revolutionary unions to ever be created functioned was through a synthesis of many revolutionary traditions under the umbrella of &#8216;one big union.&#8217;</p>



<p>Drawing from the history that allowed for anarchist to create such a revolutionary movement that was able to threaten the very foundation of the state, we can again create such an organization through unify crypto under a similar banner. Through the creation of one big union people realized that rights were not something that were meant to be protected by the state, but were something that people must defend for themselves together. Through the tradition of &#8216;An injury to one is a concern of all,&#8217; crypto renews this same revolutionary struggle into the digital age, with concern to the digital rights of all. </p>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto gave us a form of money that the state can never control. We need to take this seriously if we are to use this form of money, and everything that has come after it as part of our arsenal in the secret war that is taking place to free humanity from the shackles of fiat money and the state&#8217;s totalitarian economic control. We need allies if we are going to win in our various struggles against whatever masters may have claimed us for themselves. Through taking this idea of anarchism without adjectives and applying it to crypto, we can find a new form of synthesis; or syndicalism, that can help weave our revolutionary movement together.</p>



Crypto without Criticism, but Critiques



<p>Now I want to be clear, crypto without criticism should not mean crypto without critiques, nor should it mean that we accept fungable tokens, stablecoins, or other shitcoins that are really panoptic statist ledgers, and not crypto at all. What this strategy acknowledges is that bitcoin, while being revolutionary in its own right, and containing the messianic potential to end law and destroy the Westphalian state as we know it; there is still a great possibility that it could fail, or even worse, be seditiously compromised. Every one of us must be vigilant, thoughtful, and apply adversarial thinking to each step of our process in order to ensure that the revolutionary nature at the center of what is being done is never compromised.&nbsp;By very nature of what crypto is, we cannot have any single point of failure, which is why we must be open to other projects and the potential merits (or failings) they may offer.</p>



<p>Bitcoin unequivocally is one of the greatest invention of humanity. There is no question that what Satoshi Nakamoto created has radically changing the world, and has opened a new horizon for human freedom and action. It is even quite possible that bitcoin is messianic, and that Satoshi is the prophet of a novus ordo seclorum that will liberate us from the old law, and allow for us to enable something totally new in its place&#8211;but only time will tell. While I zealously have given myself to the cause, and believe Bitcoin to be the most revolutionary vehicle that we have, I still cannot call myself a maximalist (majoritist maybe).</p>



<p>We must be open to the possible that Satoshi is a statist, that a deep reorg 51% attack will happen, the core devs are all somehow compromised, or there is something fundamentally broken in the bitcoin code. We must be open to the worst possibilities in order to create redundancy, to build our ranks, and educate people about the possibility of freedom from fiat, however that may come. Only through creating a robust collective movement that is focused on building and using the revolutionary technology of crypto without anyone&#8217;s permission for whatever purpose it may be, will be able to create the revolutionary movement that can finally win the freedom and liberty to which we are entitled. </p>



<p>The political objective of what crypto is, how it functions, and why it creates power is of the utmost importance and we must ensure that the technologies of the future really are &#8216;crypto&#8217; and not something else. As I warned in the poverty of tokens, there is a real risk of creation a panoptic nightmare of unparalleled proportions if we run the risk of deploying broken &#8216;crypto&#8217; that isn&#8217;t crypto at all. </p>



<p>Through the tradition of anarchism without adjectives, we can create a movement for crypto without criticism. A movement which can be ideologically committed to the values that represent crypto, while also offering valid critiques of each crypto projects and their weaknesses. It is only though such intellectual exchange, inquiry, and explanation will we be able to understand one another, and create a space in which we can work together.  </p>

  ♦<p>The introduction of Bitcoin to the world ten years ago as a new monetary system sparked new interest in the field of monetary economics. After a century of fully nationalized money production systems, and about five decades of an irredeemable national paper money standard, the battle for sound money seemed to be long lost. A return to gold, even within the circles of Austrian and free-market thinkers, became an increasingly less practical approach, and it seemed there was little left to do but wait for the inevitable collapse of the contemporary system, to which we arguably came close several times.¹ The fight in the intellectual arena was seemingly over as well, both from the academic view and the general public acceptance. With very few exceptions, such as with the case of Friedrich Hayek, most prominent economists acknowledged by public endorsement were followers of the Keynesian monetary approach. Thus endorsing monetary nationalism², and the enactment of legal tender paper money, as both a cost-efficient alternative to gold and as a device for government financing and “fine-tuning” of the national economy.</p><p>At the same time, while the public and academic fights for sound money could be declared lost, the rise of new technology has opened up a new frontier, and the search for a digital monetary alternative began. A small unorganized group, composed mainly of individual computer scientists and cryptographers, called Cypherpunks, started looking into the new possibilities computer networks and cryptography could provide for liberating people, which included the effort of creating open digital money. With the pioneering works of David Chaum (DigiCash) with digital payments, and with such various later research and practical initiatives, most notably of Adam Back (HashCash), Wei Dai (b-money), Nick Szabo (BitGold) and Hal Finney (RPOW), the attempts at introducing digital cash started piling up. These efforts, though nonetheless interesting for their merit, all failed to either deliver a working system or gain sufficient traction to have any considerable impact on monetary affairs.</p><p>The introduction of Bitcoin, around late 2008, can arguably be marked as the most important turning point in monetary affairs since 1971, when the collapse of the Bretton Woods system occurred and led us to the irredeemable paper standard of today. Though not at all immediate, the growth of Bitcoin as a new form of money started to accelerate. Now, about ten years after its inception, it regularly makes it to the news headlines and has even reached US Congressional discussions. The wild success of Bitcoin consequently drew a lot of attention to the area of monetary economics and reignited the lost battle for sound money.</p><p>At first, Bitcoin received but insignificant attention and skeptical reactions from both sides, which considered it to be no more than a bubble or a passing trend. However, as time passed, and with Bitcoin growth accelerating with each passing year, it started receiving some attention, making its intellectual allies and rivals. From all economic schools, the phenomenon of Bitcoin seemed to be compatible only with the theory of the Austrian school. There, it is currently still debated with strong enthusiasm between its many supporters and skeptics. On the other hand, within all other economic schools, Bitcoin is still considered mostly as a bubble, a “market irrationality” or a trend about to collapse. The incompatibility of Bitcoin, as money not backed by the authority of the government, with their economic theories in general and their ideas on monetary economics in particular, blinded them to the mere possibility of new money like Bitcoin emerging. Despite the rather small (but growing) support, and strong opposition from the academic circles, Bitcoin has continuously progressed and established its monetary status as more economically significant than many national currencies.³</p>♦The market cap of Bitcoin compared to other national currencies and precious metals. Source: cryptovoices.com/basemoney<p>At this point, it has become clear that Bitcoin can no longer be ignored, but should rather be studied and investigated thoroughly. It seems that understanding its nature may expose both the reasons for its success, and a rough expectation for what its future holds. Throughout the previous two articles⁴, I outlined some of the foundations for understanding the economics of money, its nature and substance, from the perspective of the Austrian school. We started by looking into the nature of money as the most saleable commodity, that which imposes the least economic costs on its holders for future exchange. We then continued by exploring the various factors influencing the saleability of commodities, and therefore their likelihood to emerge as money on the market.⁵ In this article, we shall utilize this understanding and apply it to the case of Bitcoin, exploring the case for Bitcoin from the view of monetary economics.</p>Bitcoin’s Monetary Properties<p>The common monetary properties influencing the suitability of a commodity to be money, such as its divisibility, portability, and durability, are usually inherent to the physical composition of the commodity itself. The physical limitations resulting from this have affected the specific substance of money to a large extent throughout the years. For example, the physical limitation of dividing gold into small enough denominations as to be used for low-value transactions prevented its (physical) use in many exchanges, forcing people to resort to such less valuable metals as silver and copper, and later also to money certificates.</p><p>The emergence of Bitcoin as the first digital form of money allowed us to bypass those “physical” limits of money, and scale them to the almost non-existing limits of the digital realm. Understanding how Bitcoin allows us this improvement of monetary properties requires a basic understanding of how it works, and how Bitcoin is digitally represented. Bitcoin, in its “rawest” form, is a piece of software which automates the achievement of consensus over the ownership of (the conditions under which one is allowed to spend) units of Bitcoin. In other words, Bitcoin in this raw form is a list of spendable amounts and the conditions for spending them.</p><p>Since Bitcoin, unlike previous monetary assets, is not based on physical ownership, but on the consensus on its spending conditions, we should separate our discussion of its limitations into two consensus layers. The first, which is commonly termed the “on-chain” layer, is the global consensus layer which we just described, and we may think of it as the ultimate source of truth for determining ownership over Bitcoin units. From its nature as a global consensus layer, binding for all its participants, it is relatively rigid and restrictive. Thus it provides us with a somewhat moderate degree of improvement in terms of the monetary properties. For example, the divisibility of Bitcoin here is limited up to a single “satoshi,” which is equivalent to a hundred millionth of a Bitcoin. The process of division itself requires changing the spending conditions assigned to the associated units, meaning they need to be “spent” to divide them. We may notice that, despite the unit size limitation, it is possible to scale it, if necessary, through a change in the global consensus mechanism. Such changes, though extremely hard and costly to perform, are nonetheless feasible, and provide us with a certain level of improvement to the asset itself as new needs arise over time.⁶ The ability to change those technical monetary properties of the asset is an unprecedented capability which Bitcoin introduced, and already gives it a significant advantage over its predecessors.</p><p>The second, called the “off-chain” layer, utilizes the nature of Bitcoin both as a consensus-based digital asset, and as programmable software, allowing cooperating individuals to create a “subset” of the consensus of Bitcoin, and to transact within that subset using various mechanisms. If we look at the portability of Bitcoin as an example, while it is unarguably cheap and easy to move between physical locations, the transfer of actual ownership (change in spending conditions) of Bitcoin on the on-chain layer is somewhat constrained, allowing roughly about 600,000 final settlements (ownership transfers) per day. However, as transactions are usually made between cooperating entities wishing to make the transaction go through, the off-chain layer allows them to use various constructions for achieving consensus. Thereby, it enables them to scale the transaction capacity to the nearly infinite limits of the physical movement of electronic data. There are many options for such constructions, a lot of which are currently under research and development, with each of them offering widely different tradeoffs for the transacting entities. Prominent examples are the “Lightning Network,”⁷ which offers trustless and instant transactions, with mostly some liquidity limitations, and “sidechains” such as “Liquid,” which provide benefits like high-speed and confidential transactions, and asset issuance with the tradeoff of introducing trust in a federation of trusted entities which manage the consensus subset for their clients.</p><p>In conclusion of the analysis of the monetary attributes of Bitcoin, we see how the transition of the monetary asset from the physical into the digital realm allows us not only for unprecedented improvements but also a high level of flexibility in the monetary properties of the asset. Therefore, we may conclude here that Bitcoin, from the perspective of its “inherent” properties, is unprecedentedly superior to all its predecessors. With this in mind, it seems that Bitcoin deserves a further investigation of its suitability as money. We will thus continue with what is probably the most controversial and innovative aspect of Bitcoin, its production and supply.</p>Bitcoin Production<p>Before Bitcoin, the challenge of producing digital money on the market seemed almost impossible from the view of monetary economics writers.<br>Prof. Jörg Guido Hülsmann, an Austrian economist focusing on monetary economics expressed this widespread belief in one of his books. He states that “an economic good that is defined entirely in terms of bits and bytes is unlikely ever to be produced spontaneously on a free market.”⁸ Coincidentally, he published this on October 2008, two months after the whitepaper of Bitcoin was first published, and about three months before the first bitcoins came into existence.</p><p>The invention of Bitcoin indeed required finding a solution to what was up to that point an unsolved problem, the ability to produce digital scarcity with controllable supply (solving the “double spending problem”), without depending on a trusted entity. The creator of Bitcoin solved this by introducing the mechanism now commonly referred to as “Nakamoto Consensus,”⁹ which is the solution for the discussed problem. The basic idea is to have an open competition between computers over finding a solution to a mathematical challenge. This challenge is similar to a random lottery in the sense that the only known way to find a solution is through random guessing, and the chance for discovering a solution remains the same for every guess. This process requires the expenditure of computation power, which is mostly limited by the availability of energy for the computing machines. Adam Back has initially proposed a similar process as part of the HashCash system in 1997. Bitcoin works similarly to that proposed mechanism, but a critical point where Bitcoin improves over this proposal is with the ability to set a strict schedule for the production of new units. Bitcoin achieves this by using a peer to peer consensus network (which we discussed above) to enforce and validate the monetary rules and schedule, and an automatic periodical adjustment to the computational work needed for producing new units which adjusts the difficulty of the challenges, and thus the speed of production as to match the schedule.</p><p>Unlike previous monetary assets, such as gold, silver and seashells, which relied on particular physical limitation and scarcity for their production, and also unlike the current fiat paper monetary system, which relies on a trusted issuer (the central bank) for the production of money, Bitcoin relies on a purely mathematical system for its production. This characteristic allows for an objective and universal way for auditing the validity of a unit of Bitcoin and enables a fair and open competition on its production. Anyone is free to participate (and stop participating) in this competition by expending computation power, having a probabilistic chance to produce Bitcoin directly proportional to the computation they spent.</p>Money Production and Externalities<p>Historically, the production of the substance of money was always costly, both from a direct and indirect perspective. Cattle for example, which were used as money in lots of nomadic societies, were expensive to raise (“produce”) and resulted in some entirely unexpected externalities, mainly due to the great need for graze-lands required for growing them.¹⁰ Gold, as another example, is also very costly to produce, as its mining process requires filtering out many tons of dirt just to obtain a small quantity of it. Its externalities are quite unpleasant as well, as the military seizure of gold mines and the dangerous and sometimes forced labor it involves present us with multiple economic and ethical issues.</p><p>Marco Polo was perhaps the first to introduce the seemingly impressive concept of paper money, which he observed in China, to the western world.¹¹ Since he made that discovery, the appetite of rulers, bankers and intellectuals for easy money has been continuously growing. The first European experiment with easy paper money was when in 1661 the Swedish central bank, Stockholms Banco, started issuing banknotes. The practice then led to the bankruptcy of the bank just three years later, but this failure seems to have only increased the desire for more such experimentations on the part of rulers and bankers. As for intellectuals, the desire to make the production of money more “efficient” was evident from the very beginning of the field of political economy. The idea indeed finds support with such early economists as Adam Smith and John Law, which saw the use of precious metals as an inefficient process.¹² They, along with many other economists, especially from our current time, sought to make money production cheaper, thus more efficient, by replacing its substance with such cheap alternatives as paper. They believed that such an alternative monetary system could function just as well as that of precious metals, only with a fraction of the production costs. This difference between the production costs and the “face-value” of the money is what we may term as “easy” money, which we should distinct from “hard” money. Thus from this superficial point of view, the difference is that easy money has seemingly insignificant costs for its production, while hard money is expensive to produce.</p><p>The problem with easy money, and the reason which such theoretical supporters of it as David Ricardo opposed its implementation¹³, is its externalities, the hidden costs and risks which it involves. It is well known and agreed that truly easy money could never emerge on the free market. That is because, for any commodity, market participants will be willing to increase their production and its costs up to the point where it is no longer profitable to increase production. This means that if we were to attempt and install an easy monetary system on the free market, the market participants would start producing it in such quantities as to make the value of each money unit roughly equal to its production costs, canceling the intended “efficiency” of the easy money. Thus, all attempts to introduce an easy money system required the state to assign a monopoly privilege over money production to a specific entity, commonly known as the central bank. With the market participants legally prevented from participating in money production, supporters of easy money believed they could successfully reduce the costs of money production to the mere printing costs of paper notes.</p><p>However, this almost obsessive look on the direct and highly visible costs for money production has blinded those economists to the many non-obvious costs easy money imposes. First, and probably the most obvious concern, which was expressed by Ricardo, was the risk for the abuse of the system. From the many hyperinflation scenarios to the less notable moral hazards,¹⁴ the trap of easy money introduced various risks and was abused many times by those in a position to do so. This issue alone should make the trap of easy money clear. It gains small efficiency while introducing fatal risks and many points of moral hazard. However, there are two more aspects where the fallacy of cheap money is exposed.</p><p>The second aspect we may look at is the actual costs of operating such a system. With the large bureaucracies typical to all public institutions, and with hundreds of thousands of central bank workers, it is hardly disputed that the supposedly “cheap” and efficient paper money system of today is really more efficient compared to hard money.¹⁵ Along with this consideration, we should also note that the production of gold for monetary purposes still continues to a large extent. Therefore, these extra costs of the cheap money system come mostly in addition to, not instead of, the costs of the previous hard money one. The issue gets even worse when we understand the important fact that while regulations excluded market participants from direct money production per se, those will still expend as many resources as is still profitable on forecasting and influencing the policies of the central banks. The supporters of easy money have evidently failed to take into account the willingness of market participants to still make the most out of money production, and the jobs of many analysts, economic forecasters and lobbyists are the results of this indirect inefficiency of easy money.</p><p>The third and most critical issue that easy money causes is the manipulation of the market process. The market uses money as a tool for resource allocation, with money holders directing the market according to their needs and demands. However, when using easy money, its producer (the central bank) has the power to disproportionately influence the allocation of resources. In fact, we can say it practically takes control over the market, as it can cheaply create money for itself to direct resources as it wishes. Thus, in an easy money economy, the power to allocate resources shifts from the market to those who control the central bank. This distortion of the market gradually shifts the entire economy into indirect central planning. Combined with the moral hazards involved with cheap money production, this process accelerates even further, with the ensuing destructive consequences of economic central planning, disguised under the pretense of a market phenomena.</p><p>Easy money, as we see, does not reduce the costs of money production, neither does it make it more efficient in any other sense. The only function it fulfills is to reduce the directly visible costs of money production, while disproportionately increasing the hidden, non-obvious ones. We can draw two main conclusions from this analysis. The first and more obvious one, is that easy money is not only inefficient but may even be destructive due to its risks and externalities. Second, we can notice here that we should aspire to have the process of money production be obvious and transparent, as to minimize such risks and unexpected externalities.</p><p>When looking at Bitcoin, one of its remarkable features is its process of production. The most significant and costly part of producing Bitcoin, as discussed above, is the process of turning energy into electricity, and converting this into computational power. While all types of production require the use of energy, most other processes require applying it in very indirect methods, and more importantly, at highly specific locations. The production of gold, for example, requires both extensive human labor and many complicated types of machinery, but more importantly, it requires miners to apply them at particular locations (gold mines). Thus, gold not only requires many complications for its production process, but it also limits the ability of people to produce it to specific locations. The production of Bitcoin, on the other hand, allows anyone, anywhere in the world¹⁶, where there is an untapped energy source, to use it to produce Bitcoin. This unique production process of Bitcoin has three main advantages we shall discuss here.</p><p>First, it makes the competition for money production more fair and open than ever, removing many spatial constraints and allowing for a truly efficient process of market competition. Second, by making the process of production so simple and straightforward, Bitcoin reduces the hidden costs and externalities involved in the process of money production. This reduction of externalities makes the system much more robust overall and allows us to understand its consequences better. Third, the production of Bitcoin, by removing spatial limitations, allows the utilization of energy sources which were previously unusable due to such spatial considerations. The ruthless competition in Bitcoin production forces its producers (often called miners), to minimize their costs as to be more efficient than their competitors. This competition requires them to constantly seek for the most efficient energy production process, which will minimize their successive production cost, and it appears, both theoretically and in practice, that this most efficient source is to be found in renewables. The energy naturally available from these sources, such as sunlight, water, wind, and many others, is much cheaper than traditional sources as it is both so plentiful and mostly unused. While transportation costs of such energy limit its viability for many daily purposes, the production of Bitcoin has no such spatial limitations. Thus, the production of Bitcoin promotes the profitable funding and development of renewable energy and incentivizes progress in the field of energy production.¹⁷ It is thus no surprise to find out that most of the energy used for Bitcoin production likely comes from renewable energy sources¹⁸, making Bitcoin production probably one of the cleanest sectors of the economy.</p><p>We may summarize here that, as for the reasons discussed above, the production of Bitcoin seems to be the most desirable process for money production we may have. The fact that it is hard money, combined with its simple and transparent production process, open and direct competition, and seemingly positive externalities makes it largely superior to any of its predecessors. The second important consideration, which is typically linked to the production process of money, is the issue of its supply and is our next point of discussion.</p>The Supply of Bitcoin<p>The nature of Bitcoin as a software-based asset means that its supply, unlike previous natural monies¹⁹, is under the ultimate control of its users. It is, in fact, a critical part of its consensus rules, and is capped at roughly 21 million Bitcoin units. This is usually termed as the “monetary policy” of Bitcoin and is enforced by the economic activity of each participant of the Bitcoin network. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin as a peer to peer network means there is no central entity authorized to dictate the monetary policy of Bitcoin. So while it is theoretically possible to change this policy, such a change in practice does not seem to be likely or even possible, thus it is not considered within this article.</p><p>This policy of Bitcoin is in sharp contrast with the prevailing policies enacted by the central banks of today. These institutions, from their very inception, have been pursuing policies of constant expansion of the money supply. These expansionary policies tend to be justified as necessary for the “common good” as they supposedly allow the government, and its “highly qualified” economists, to promote economic growth, reduce unemployment, and combat the business cycle. A task at which they have failed quite miserably for the last hundred years, during which those problems seems to have only further aggravated.²⁰ Within the present discussions, the monetary policy of Bitcoin is usually deemed to be quite radical in the eyes of most. Many critics of Bitcoin have claimed that this lack of an “elastic” monetary policy, that is a policy which may be modified according to the alleged needs of arising circumstances, prevent Bitcoin from ever seeing any meaningful adoption.</p><p>However, the notion of a need or even a necessity of an elastic policy has started to gain notable support only around the last hundred years. It is, therefore, a relatively new one compared to the thousands, or arguably tens of thousands, of years where money existed.²¹ Furthermore, when inspected more closely, the modern experiment with an elastic monetary policy, enacted and managed by central banks, have failed to achieve any objectives it has set to itself.²² The list of those broken promises from our central bankers includes the inability to tame the business cycle, a failure to maintain consistently low unemployment rates, and a complete failure to preserve the value of the money and the general price level.²³</p>♦Purchasing Power of the U.S. Dollar (1913–2013). During this period, the USD lost at least 95% of its purchasing power.<p>The case for an elastic monetary policy, which many take for granted today as a necessity of money, is quite unconvincing in view of its actual merits and results. This goes without even mentioning its utterly indisputable failures before this modern attempt.²⁴ Moreover, this claim gets even weaker when we take into account the more than 50 economic collapses caused by hyperinflation just in the last century, which could not occur if not to the presence of elastic monetary policy.²⁵ ²⁶</p><p>A full critique of the ills of modern central banking, and the errors on which their theories lie upon is out of scope for this article. The interested reader can find references to such works in the footnotes.²⁷ For our present purposes, we shall focus on the most notable arguments for why an elastic monetary policy is undesirable, and why Bitcoin’s limited supply serves for its advantage over its predecessors. Let us start by first exploring the idea of a “need” for an elastic monetary policy. As mentioned above, in light of its empirical failures, and when considering the impressive success of the gold standard which prevailed during La Belle Époque, and ended around the time of the establishment of the Federal Reserve System, there seem to be no empirical grounds for an actual “necessity” of elastic monetary policy. However, despite the lack of evidence for such necessity, one may still argue that such a policy would generally be desirable. Thus, we shall now turn to investigate this question further.</p><p>With our prior discussion of easy money, which in principle is money with such elastic monetary policy, we have already articulated some of its ills. Those include severe moral hazard and the potential risk of abuse and ruin of the system. We shall now skip these stated issues and focus on an additional, more general argument against this policy type, which deals with the epistemic errors of such central planning of the supply of money and credit.²⁸</p><p>Let us suppose that those in charge of the monetary policy have managed to resist all temptations for abusing it and are doing their best to help the economy. They may have at their disposal insurmountable amounts of data and information of supposedly relevant metrics. Their task is then to use all this knowledge and insights to adjust prices as to induce people to make economic decisions according to what they (the central planners) believe will have the most positive effect on the economy. In other words, they use their influence over the supply of money and credit in the economy to regulate such behaviors as prices and unemployment rates. The task of these central planners is then to predict the influence possible monetary policies might have on the parameters they wish to adjust (CPI, unemployment, etc.), and pursue the most “optimal” option of them.</p><p>However, this means they need not just predict the consequences of their actions, but also any reactions to these, and therefore any further reactions to those consequences as well. All attempts at predicting and modeling the most optimal monetary policy, even under the assumption that there exists such an optimal one, will fail from the very nature of the economy, which is a complex of individuals acting, and most importantly reacting, at an attempt to provide for themselves. The actions and reactions of humans are by themselves mostly unpredictable, but attempting to predict the repercussions of such reactions to changes, and the consequent reactions to the changes caused by those prior reactions must be considered ludicrous.²⁹</p><p>The inability of central bankers to make predictions of the economy is even more visible when we consider the limitations of the data which they can possess. Within the realm of social phenomena in general, and economic phenomena in particular, the outcome is dependent to a large extent on all human actions involved in forming them. While we know how to measure certain parameters with high precision, we have no ability to measure many other facts relevant to the economic actions of individuals. Hayek explained this limitation of knowledge with the example of prices and wages, saying: “Into the determination of these prices and wages there will enter the effects of particular information possessed by every one of the participants in the market process — a sum of facts which in their totality cannot be known to the scientific observer, or to any other single brain.”³⁰ This lack of access to such many important facts caused most economists to completely ignore their significance, in Hayek’s words again: “they [economists] thereupon happily proceed on the fiction that the factors which they can measure are the only ones that are relevant.”³¹ Central bankers, as we see, necessarily start their task with a highly incomplete picture of the past and present. Thus, their efforts to predict economic results are doomed to fail from the beginning, as even if they had proper methods to derive predictions from data, it is impossible for them to account for all data influencing human actions, and as we saw, every single action may potentially have a disruptive effect on the entire process.</p><p>The only prediction I can confidently make is that central bankers, as they continue to meddle with the supply of money and credit, will continue to produce unexpected behaviors, and as a result will miserably fool themselves with their efforts to predict — Bitcoin is a financial bet on this exact prediction. As long as the monetary policy is elastic, we are guaranteed to suffer from such epistemic errors and prediction failures, and economic crises will inevitably ensue. The economy is an interdependent system, and any artificial intervention will cause unexpected byproduct results, whose influence will get further aggravated with further interventions. For more than a hundred years, economists have tried to plan the supply of money, and with every intervention, another crisis ensued. It might then be the most appropriate time to face this failure, admit that the economy is too complicated for a central planner to predict, and let individuals make their own decisions as to form the complete picture from their actions.³²</p><p>We have by now cleared the concerns regarding the inelastic monetary policy of Bitcoin, and proved it to be superior to an elastic policy. However, one could argue that a static inflation schedule, for example of 2% per year, could still be a viable option instead of a capped limit.³³ While it is probably true that Bitcoin could still work well even without a strictly limited supply, such inflation seems to be undesirable and even harmful. Monetary inflation, while not necessarily harmful per se, has highly non-linear and complex effects, with influence that which, as we saw, we cannot fully predict. The urge of some to tinker with such a complex system which they do not understand, or worse, believe themselves to understand, is at most not harmful, but may easily become destructive. Furthermore, if we investigate deeper, there seems to be no justification for expansionary policy in the first place.</p><p>When we understand the nature of money, and its emergence on the market, such inflation seems to be very undesirable. Money emerges based on its ability to reduce the costs of exchange, and an important factor for that is its ability to maintain its value over time. It is well known that an increase in the supply of money dilutes the value of each unit, its purchasing power, and thus imposes higher costs for using it in delayed transactions. An inflationary policy could thus hamper the adoption of Bitcoin, by making it less useful for transacting, and would not give us any benefit.³⁴ To the contrary, an inflationary policy could reduce the accuracy of economic calculations, and would also reduce cash savings and encourage spending, which in a previous article, we already proved undesirable.</p><p>Throughout this part, we looked at the basics of the production process of Bitcoin and into its monetary policy. We discussed the idea of money production and its externalities, and how Bitcoin as hard money has the preferable production process out of all. We explored the trap of easy money, and more specifically, that of having an elastic monetary policy, and showed how Bitcoin managed to avoid getting into such issues. Finally, we have also seen how the actual hard policy taken as the rule of Bitcoin, a finite, limited supply, serves to its advantage and promotes proper economic incentives for savings and capital accumulation, while also serving as a reliable measurement for economic calculations.</p><p>Up to now, we have explored the “inherent” characteristics of Bitcoin, and as we have so far reached very positive conclusions. We shall continue going deeper into the monetary case for Bitcoin by moving to explore the external factors influencing the substance of money, and how Bitcoin deals with them.</p>Legislating Bitcoin<p>In a previous article, we have singled out three prominent external factors affecting the adoption of a monetary substance: legislation, societal structure, and epistemic considerations. We will now turn to inspect each of those factors and attempt to understand how they affect Bitcoin as money, starting here from the legislative aspect.</p><p>Even a shallow inquiry into the demise of the use of precious metals as the common monetary substance will reveal to us that it was the influence of legislative authorities which brought upon this demise. With the initial monopoly status granted to gold over other precious metals in most countries, and its further centralization under the control of central banks, the legislative authorities have influenced the specific choice of metallic money. With this centralization of power, they were later able to effectively confiscate gold holdings (Executive Order 6102)³⁵, preventing any everyday use of them. The last link of our money to gold was then finally broken with Executive Order 11615, issued by President Nixon in 1971.³⁶ This order ended the long transition process from metallic money into an irredeemable paper standard. This most recent example exposes us just how strong can the influence of the legal authorities be over our choice of money, and with the contemporary system of sovereign currencies, those authorities do not seem to like the idea of being challenged by Bitcoin.</p><p>Though the legal challenges Bitcoin is up to seem incredibly hard indeed, this is precisely what it was designed for. Bitcoin, from its very beginning, was created with the Cypherpunk ethos of liberty and freedom, and the use of cryptography in achieving liberation from oppression. Those challenges for Bitcoin are precisely the reason for its creation in the first place. For more than half a century we have been living under an oppressive fiat paper monetary system, and any attempt to implement a competing system was shut down.³⁷ In contrast, Bitcoin was built with all those past failures in mind and was designed to survive such threats. As its creator explained:</p><blockquote>“A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.”³⁸</blockquote><p>The production and maintenance process of Bitcoin is highly open and provides financial incentives for participants matching the actual demand for using Bitcoin, through the payment of transaction fees.³⁹ The mechanism of storing Bitcoin with private key cryptography makes it resilient to confiscation attempts. Along with the insistence on keeping verification costs extremely low, we can see how these are all design choices aimed at making Bitcoin survive, and even thrive, wherever economic and financial oppression is present.</p><p>This “legislation-resilient” nature of Bitcoin is so strong and robust that one US Congressman, Patrick McHenry, even went as far as to call Bitcoin an ‘Unstoppable Force.’ Continuing that “We [the government] should not attempt to deter this innovation; governments cannot stop this innovation, and those that have tried have already failed.”⁴⁰ While there are many other legislators, who do not share this view, this bold statement emphasizes the idea of Bitcoin, and the mission of those it gathered behind it. We may not know yet whether Bitcoin will truly be capable of standing up to the legal challenges and governmental pressures it is likely to face, but if one thing is clear, it is that Bitcoin is our best shot at it. This legal resistance of Bitcoin is probably its most significant improvement over previous sound monies and is where its real advantage lies.⁴¹</p><p>Now assuming that governments understand the difficulty in stopping Bitcoin, there is the possibility of them choosing to use it, because of the financial incentives it provides them. Even though they removed the use of gold as money from our daily lives, governments, mainly through their central banks, are still massively accumulating it in increasing quantities, with roughly 17% of the total above-ground gold stocks under their possession.⁴² When Bitcoin becomes significant enough, there is a chance that governments will purchase it as a gold alternative, monetizing it for their international monetary affairs, or as a hedging tool to “store value”.⁴³ Another option for governments to monetize the success of Bitcoin is through participation, whether direct or indirect, in its mining operations, as they control many of the most plentiful sources for energy production. Such mining operations would benefit both the states as another source of income and also help Bitcoin, which utilizes the higher energy invested in its mining for securing its network. While such acts on behalf of governments do not seem likely in the short or medium terms, the option remains very plausible for the long run.</p>Social Globalization and Bitcoin<p>The second significant external factor we have identified is that of the prevailing social structure, with the contemporary one being a trend towards globalization and international cooperation. Understanding the needs such transition of society brings with it is highly important to understand what is the proper money to serve such a society. Society today is shifting into urbanization at a high pace, with most of the world’s population living in urban cities.⁴⁴ The role that the Internet plays in our daily lives becomes increasingly more significant as well. With more than 4 billion Internet users⁴⁵, the effect that this technology has on society seems to surpass most previous inventions in the extent of its reach and impact.</p>♦<p>Though society is more connected than ever, the world is in a severe state of monetary disintegration on a level unseen in hundreds of years. While in the past most currencies were simply different weights of precious metals, thus accepted almost universally in commerce, today we have hundreds of incompatible paper currencies, disintegrating the world’s market and hurting the global division of labor. Any social cooperation over most state borders now requires monetary exchange between multiple currencies. This imposes additional costs while complicating and distorting economic calculations, and requires trusting more financial institutions. To this issue, we may add the problem of transactions settlements. Due to the costs and regulations of moving currencies across national borders, such settlement is highly expensive and requires the centralized process of going through multiple intermediaries.</p><p>With the shift of society into a globally interconnected one, and with ever-increasing amounts of electronic transactions done worldwide, the need for money native to the digital environment grows ever stronger and larger. Settling payments with strangers, without trusting financial intermediaries or the central banks which issue the currencies, is currently an impractical process. Furthermore, such a process simply cannot be implemented with any monetary system we have ever had, up to Bitcoin. As a completely electronic commodity, Bitcoin allows for settlements anywhere in the world, without the need for trusted clearance of payments. It does not require expensive international physical shipments and is easy to store and use from anywhere with minimal costs. Looking at the modern structure of society, there seems to be a genuine need for trustless, natively digital money, and this is likely to promote Bitcoin’s adoption as “the decentralized alternative to central banking”.⁴⁶</p>Understanding Bitcoin — The Epistemic Barrier to Bitcoin Adoption<p>Our final consideration to discuss before we can conclude our investigation is of the third notable external factor influencing the substance of money, the epistemic one. Unlike previous monies, like gold, furs or cattle, Bitcoin has no “practical” use beyond its monetary use. In this regard, it is similar to collectible monies, such as wampums and various seashells, and in this specific regard also to the present fiat paper money. In a more conventional, though not economically accurate term, it has no “intrinsic value.” Debating whether such intrinsic value is necessary, or more accurately if it exists at all, is out of scope and irrelevant here.⁴⁷</p><p>What is essential for us, for understanding the epistemic barriers for Bitcoin, is that because of the lack of such widespread practical use, and unlike the (arguably) natural beauty of seashells⁴⁸, or the legislative promotion of paper fiat money, there is nothing which promotes the use of Bitcoin, thus its initial accumulation, beyond its monetary use. Thus, we may say that there are only two forces promoting the adoption of Bitcoin, the “economic” and the “epistemic”, without any “indirect utility” playing a role. What I call here the economic force of Bitcoin is what we have discussed thus far, and is concerned with the economic incentives for using Bitcoin, and the benefits which it provides over legacy systems.</p><p>The second, “epistemic” force, deals with our understanding of money in general, and Bitcoin in particular, and with the use of our knowledge in guiding our economic decisions. That is, the more we understand money, its origins, and nature, the better our decisions will be in this regard. The epistemic force I discuss here is thus the motivation of using Bitcoin which does not come from a direct and immediate (or expected to be immediately available) benefit of Bitcoin, but from that which is expected to eventually come from understanding Bitcoin and its advantages. While in the very beginning of Bitcoin I believe most of its holders have participated purely due to the epistemic motive, I think that, as for today, the economic force is what tempts most people to come, but the epistemic is what motivates them to stay. This process is mostly evident during the “supply shocks” (halvings) of Bitcoin, after which we have so far witnessed Bitcoin’s price drastically increasing. This increase in price (economic force) draws masive attention towards Bitcoin, but after the hype fades away, what keeps many still interested is the understanding of Bitcoin and its vision (epistemic force). However, a true adoption of Bitcoin is likely to happen only when the economic force of Bitcoin is so strong as to make the epistemic one (of understanding Bitcoin) unnecessary for making people use it as part of their daily lives.</p><p>This last subject I find the most important in the article, as unlike the others, this is the only one where I see Bitcoin at a significant disadvantage. While for gold, its established history of thousands of years of monetary use tends to be a sufficient substitute for understanding why it works so well, Bitcoin enjoys no such luxury. On the other hand, fiat paper money, whose “established history” is flooded with failures and economic collapses manage to pass this epistemic issue by providing direct funding for the academic economics department and also serving as their most significant employment option. Fiat money then provided such academics with highly respected, influential, and well-paying jobs, and they, in turn, produced the epistemic base for such a monetary system and certify it with their “credentials.” In contrast, Bitcoin, being hard money, has no budget for producing such “scientific base” for itself, and does not provide economists with such influential jobs, but mostly replace their current workings. It is no surprise, therefore, to find out that very little has been written in favor of Bitcoin, especially in academic circles, as mentioned in the opening here.</p><p>Without sufficient resources for understanding money and Bitcoin, the only force promoting its adoption would be the economic one. Even if it could be sufficient alone, it will certainly not work well enough, and a transition into Bitcoin would seem unlikely before the contemporary system collapses upon itself, making a transition highly unpleasant, and unnecessarily so. However, the more resources for understanding Bitcoin that exist, and the better people understand the reasons for Bitcoin, the faster they will act to adopt it, and thus the sooner and smoother the transition into using it may be.</p><p>Today, with more than a century of central banking, the general understanding of money is entirely flawed, and even more so in most academic discussions, where they still believe they can “fine-tune” the economy with their complex mathematical models and inflation targets. The last crisis of 2008 has shaken the trust in the current system, and rightly so, but most alternatives offered to the public for understanding money have only aggravated the errors of the contemporary system. Statements like “money is whatever the state decrees as such,” or “money is just a shared illusion” are now very common, even among many Bitcoin supporters, and this only shows how extensive the work of explaining Bitcoin and money is. The point here and the purpose of this article is to show just how important it is to explain money in general, and Bitcoin in particular, to others in order to make it succeed as a truly peaceful revolution.⁴⁹</p>Conclusions — The Emergence of Bitcoin<p>The last ten years have been some of the most interesting to observe from the perspective of monetary economics. During this period, we got to witness the first monetary good which was invented, rather than discovered, by the free market, and the astonishingly fast process of its monetization. What started as seemingly just another ill-fated proposal on the Cypherpunks’ mailing list⁵⁰ has grown into a fully functioning monetary system actively serving millions of people worldwide. Throughout this article, we went through the common factors which influence the saleability of money, therefore its adoption on the market, and examined how Bitcoin fares compared to its predecessors. Now, to come full circle with our analysis of Bitcoin, we shall briefly take an overall look at Bitcoin’s process of emergence, from its early beginning to how it how it may proceed in the future.</p><p>When Bitcoin just launched, and for the first few months of its existence, it had no price, and was transacted mostly for testing the software. The “zero to one” moment of Bitcoin was when in October 2009, its first exchange rate was published and it first became valuable in exchange. Soon after, its few early adopters started exchanging it, breathing life into the system by giving Bitcoin its initial price. As they were willing to spend money to bring Bitcoin to life, while almost no one knew what Bitcoin was going to become, they must have been motivated enough just from the vision of Bitcoin’s potential. Thus Bitcoin started circulating not from another “useful” utility, nor by authoritative decree, but from the voluntary actions of its early adopters which valued the opportunity of creating a new monetary system — more than the money they had to spend to facilitate a reality of Bitcoin’s visionary potential.⁵¹</p><p>Going a bit forward, while Bitcoin had some exchange value, the number of exchange opportunities which were available for it was quite small, as the demand for it as a medium of exchange had only just began to coalesce. This means that people initially had to wait a substantial amount of time, compared to the established paper money, to exchange it. That is, they had to hold it to adopt it. Here lies the main reason why the hardness of Bitcoin and its limited supply was, and still is, crucial for its success. Without a hard inelastic policy, the uncertainty which would accompany holding Bitcoin, due to the risk of monetary inflation and consequent depreciation, would be too high and would prevent it from seeing any meaningful adoption.</p><p>The monetary hardness of Bitcoin is what allows people to confidently hold it, knowing their wealth will not be diluted. In addition, its limited supply means that as its adoption grows, Bitcoin will necessarily become more valuable, without suffering the negative effect of inflation which would reduce its value. Therefore, the limited supply of Bitcoin, by itself, provides a strong economic incentive to adopt and hold it for those who understand its superiority as a monetary asset, and thus expect the demand for it to increase with time. Satoshi himself understood this very well, writing:</p><blockquote>“Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up.”⁵²</blockquote><p>As for today, Bitcoin is circulating at a much higher velocity than in the past, with many more exchange opportunities for it. However, there is still a very long way for Bitcoin if it is to become a widely used monetary system. The process of monetization, like all other phenomena of social cooperation, is a non-linear process accelerating and benefiting from each additional use. Thus, the velocity of Bitcoin and its use in day to day manner shall not be expected to become substantial in the very near future but should accelerate when inspected in the long term. Looking at the progress it made so far, there seems to be a good reason to believe Bitcoin will succeed to achieve such “critical mass” needed for reaching sufficient acceleration of growth and becoming common money throughout the world.</p><p>Currently, the two domains where Bitcoin grows most significantly are within the realm of the Internet, where it has “home advantage,” and in countries that lack minimal economic freedom. In the latter domain, within countries such as Turkey, Iran, and Argentina, we can see how Bitcoin provides some degree of immediate relief from the economic oppression imposed on those who live there. The tighter capital controls get, and the higher the inflation rate goes, the more significant becomes the benefit of using Bitcoin as a government-resistant alternative. Therefore, while we cannot know with certainty how Bitcoin will grow, it seems likely that the emergence of Bitcoin as money will continue largely within economically oppressed countries, whose citizens need Bitcoin to protect their wealth the most, and will continue to increase most substantially where economic crises arise. It appears that, at this stage, Bitcoin is a free market good, which demonstrates its value proposition most effectively in the absence of free markets. Authoritarian attempts to restrict it only promote its use, and thus it seems that Bitcoin truly deserves to be called an antifragile money.</p><p>[1]: The crises of the 1980s and 2008 are notable examples of such collapses which seem like they could easily turn catastrophic to the system.<br>[2]: Friedrich A.

  <blockquote>We live in an extraordinary age. These are times of stunning changes in social organization, economic well-being, moral and ethical precepts, philosophical and religious perspectives, and human self-knowledge, as well as in our understanding of that vast universe in which we are imbedded like a grain of sand in a cosmic ocean…there is only one generation privileged to live through that unique transitional moment: that generation is ours.</blockquote><blockquote>Carl Sagan</blockquote><p>Welcome to the Stacking Sats Universe! The words above were expressed a generation ago to describe a historical moment in understanding the cosmos. Today, we live in another “extraordinary age” and while it may not have the same grandeur of that age…you now live in the Digital Age. You are living in a time that bitcoin exists and a time that you are able to Stack Sats.</p>♦The Digital World: Circa 2019<p>This article will provide a brief overview on Stacking Sats along with an overview of three services that are currently available to the Sats Stacker.</p><p>Stacking Sats?</p><p>Stacking Sats (i.e. #stackingsats) is the act of accumulating bitcoin over time. A Satoshi which can be abbreviated as Sat(s), is 1/100 millionth of a bitcoin. The term Stacking Sats has developed to describe a means of acquiring bitcoin which is generally the size of a small fractional amount of bitcoin.</p><p>Stacking Sats Services (say that 3 times fast)</p><p>The scope of services that we will cover in the Stacking Sats Universe have the quality of being a passive way to Stack Sats. The idea is that your current shopping behavior should have little-to-no modification for you to tap into this Universe.</p><p>Let’s start with a visual. We will define each circle (i.e. category) and then provide an overview of each of the Services below.</p>♦Venn Diagram of the Stacking Sats Universe of Services<ul><li>Brick and Mortar: Allows you to Stack Sats while shopping at a physical retail location</li><li>Online: Allows you to Stack Sats while shopping online.</li><li>Bitcoin Only: Allows you to accumulate bitcoin exclusively (i.e. no other Digital Asset is supported)</li><li>Uses cash/card: Allows you to purchase items using a card or other “traditional” payment channel</li><li>Uses Bitcoin: Allows you to purchase items directly with bitcoin</li><li>Uses Lightning: Allows you to purchase items directly using the lightning network (a level 2 payment network built on top of bitcoin)</li></ul><p>Lastly for the three services in this article, the following is the unique differentiator of each from the other two:</p><ul><li>Fold: Earn bitcoin as you spend bitcoin.</li><li>Lolli: Earn bitcoin as you shop online.</li><li>Pei: Earn bitcoin as you shop with your credit/debit card.</li></ul><p>Fold</p><blockquote>Spend bitcoin in the real world</blockquote><p>Fold offers a wide range of benefits to the Sats Stacker. Fold allows you to spend bitcoin to purchase gift cards and other services from a number of popular retailers (online / brick &amp; mortar). As of this writing, Fold has 15 retailers including Amazon.com, Southwest Airlines, Uber, and other popular places.</p><p>Fold is also unique in accepting payments through the Lightning Network which allows for nearly immediate purchasing and credit towards the retailer.</p><p>Also, for the Amazon fan, Fold allows you to credit your purchased Amazon balance directly to your Amazon account with one click.</p><p>When you purchase from a retailer (generally a gift card or online credit) through Fold, you will earn Sats back (e.g. 20% back with Starbucks), and you can accumulate the Sats to be applied to future purchases (aka Kickbacks).</p><p>Unlike the other services in this article (which are only available in the United States of America), Fold has limited availability outside of the US.</p><blockquote>Get bitcoin when you shop</blockquote><p>Fold matches well for current bitcoiners who:</p><ul><li>Have bitcoin to spend</li><li>Have access to low cost bitcoin purchasing to arbitrage the Sats back</li><li>Are interested in using the lightning network</li></ul><p>Coming Soon:</p><ul><li>Currently Fold is online only; however, the Fold app has been announced and will be opened soon to Early Access users. UPDATE: Fold app is now available.</li><li>Currently Fold does not accept payments via credit card; however, this service is also coming soon to Early Access users. This should bring Fold to new users including those that are not currently hodl’rs UPDATE: Credit card purchases are now supported.</li></ul><p>That One Unique Thing:</p><ul><li>For Lightning enthusiast, connect directly to Fold’s Lightning Node and have a vested interest in Fold’s success</li></ul><p>Wish List:</p><ul><li>Currently, unlike the other services in this article, users are unable to withdraw accumulated Sats from Fold.</li></ul><p>If interested, sign up here:</p><p>Fold</p><p>Lolli</p><blockquote>Earn free bitcoin when you shop online</blockquote><p>Lolli offers a wide range of online retailer options (over 500 online merchants) for the Sats Stacker. This is an impressive line up of retailers and one can realize significant accumulation of Satoshis when shopping for high-ticket items like flights (e.g. Priceline) and places to stay (e.g. VRBO, Hotels.com, Marriott, Hilton, etc…)</p><p>Lolli is available through two modes: either by accessing the retailer through Lolli’s website or by installing a Lolli Chrome Extension. In either case, Lolli complements the shoppers regular online shopping experience as there are no complicated interfaces / payment processes for the shopper to use. Once signed up: shop online and begin to earn your Sats!</p><p>Lolli is more limited (or is it focused?) than the other services in this article as it is currently an online only shopping experience. Lolli has a clear mission statement to make bitcoin more accessible and easy to earn, save, and share bitcoin.</p><blockquote>Lolli makes it safe, simple and fun for everyone to own bitcoin.</blockquote><p>Lolli matches well with nocoiners and passive accumulators who:</p><ul><li>Desire simplicity to set it and forget it</li><li>Prefer integrated experience into their current online shopping</li><li>Want to purchase Sats at a future rate (see following notes for more details)</li></ul><p>One unique detail with Lolli is that accumulated Sats do not generally receive the price at the purchase time with the retailer. As a result, Sats values will fluctuate with the market and generally take 30 to 90 days before being considered a settled balance for withdrawals. This ensures that the items have not been returned since purchased as this will leave Lolli holding an empty bag.</p><p>Coming Soon:</p><ul><li>Based on previous announcements, expect that Lolli will continue to announce high visibility partnerships along with news media appearances in telling the Stacking Sats story.</li><li>Currently Lolli is online / Chrome extension; however, Lolli has stated plans to build a native mobile app in the near future.</li><li>Currently Lolli is available only in the United States of America; however, they are soliciting non-US interested individuals to provide their location so that they can contact them in the future when Lolli expands beyond the US.</li></ul><p>That One Unique Thing:</p><ul><li>Online shoppers place orders as they have always done in the past directly through the retailers online purchase process…Lolli does the rest in the background to reward the shopper.</li></ul><p>Wish List:</p><ul><li>The mobile app is needed for those on the go and wanting to have greater assurance that they will receive credit on their online purchases when using Lolli away from a computer.</li></ul><p>If interested, sign up here:</p><p>Lolli: Earn Bitcoin When You Shop</p><p>Pei</p><blockquote>Automatic Cashback, in Bitcoin or Cash.</blockquote><p>Pei allows users to earn automatic bitcoin (or cash) back as they shop both online and brick &amp; mortar with their personal credit/debit card. In a sense, Pei adds a rewards program to a person’s card when shopping at eligible retailers (over 120,000 merchants!)</p><p>Pei offers a limited number of online bitcoin back with places such as Uber; however, the majority of Stacking Sats opportunities are available in the brick &amp; mortar space. Through geolocation and in using an embedded map view, users are able to locate various near-by places such as gas stations and restaurants along with the Sats/Cashback opportunities with each.</p><blockquote>More Savings. More Bitcoin. More Cash.</blockquote><p>Pei matches well with cashback app and reward card users who:</p><ul><li>Are interested in a bitcoin alternatives that allow them to connect their card and earn</li><li>Are comfortable with linking your card to apps that can track your activity</li><li>Are Sats maximizers who look for the best Sats back when shopping in the non-digital world</li></ul><p>Coming Soon:</p><ul><li>Something big? Pei has recently been posting about “game changing releases.” Keep an eye toward their future development and announcements.</li><li>Currently Pei is bitcoin / cashback only. Pei may soon no longer be in the bitcoin-only category as they have stated plans to offer additional cryptocurrencies in the future.</li></ul><p>That One Unique Thing:</p><ul><li>The recently added Finance Overview provides a nice visual representation of your card usage along with the amount of Sats/Cashback returns.</li></ul><p>Wish List:</p><ul><li>Expansion beyond the United States of America so that more of the world can experience Sats back!</li></ul><p>If interested, sign up here:</p><p>Automatic cashback in Bitcoin or cash.</p><p>The Stacking Sats Universe is expanding. If you have any services that were not mentioned in this article, please let me know! Though for any Stacking Sats journeyer, the three above are a great start to navigating our Digital Economic Universe.</p><p>Happy Travels!</p>♦<p>Stacking Sats Universe was originally published in Coinmonks on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  I humble offer the following homily as thanks to you and the glory to which you are creating through crypto.



♦Stéphane Mallarmé, <br>&#8220;A throw of the dice will never abolish chance!&#8220;<br>Apparently there are encrypted meaning in Mallarmé&#8217;s poetry, similar to Edgar Allen Poe







<p>Hello Friends, Brothers of Bitcoin, Sisters of Secrecy, Comrades of Crypto, and any Fiat Foreigner who will lend me their eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for the glory to which you are building and hodling with me in this place we call crypto. Despite not knowing you in the world of Flesh and Steel, there is a hedl camaraderie and solidarity that we share that goes beyond our physical bodies, and into the new digital one we are creating. Together we are building a new commonwealth that cryptography has enabled and introduces a new form of wealth into this world. It is beyond the corruption and avarice that is fiat money and government power; and has the astounding concealed truth of Libertas as the secret its hodls at core. Together, we are seizing the means of safety and security for the commonality of our wealth that no sovereign power anywhere can guarantee any longer. Block by block, bit by bit, byte by byte, we validate this new world together, the minting of a new kind of friendship and hope; a new commonwealth of freedom for our time and beyond.</p>



<p>It is because of you, Friend, Majestic Other Invictus, s/he with 2²⁵⁶ hidden faces and beyond; it is you Private One, that makes all of this possible, and I want to thank you for just that.</p>



<p>Oh how I wish I could meet you face-to-face friend! As a peer-to-peer, just a sibling of flesh, a child of matter, but I understand why it must never be. It  is our providence that we will only know each other’s digital signatures and nothing more; the Other’s only True Name. For you and I are one-in-the-same, part of the same infinite fabric of homogeneity that is both the sign of the holiness of this digital noosphere that has been created, and also the seal of the sins of that which has been done in meatspace that compels us to meet at this Schilling point here. It is only here in this digital space beyond the wrath and tears of our physical bodies, that we can provably meet here together as equals with no identity other than the secret name from our heart of hearts, that only God can ever know. </p>



<p>It is only though your glory, that of the Anonymous Other, whose face-to-face that I will never see; that you show yourself for all your power and glory for what it really is. It is you who has shown me the path towards the port from which I will gain harbor, and it is for you whom I will always be a humble peer, a node in your constellation of freedom. You are the the Alice to my Bob, the lover who I will never really know, but with whom I must demand to commune with absolute, holy assured privacy; to glorify our mutual God hidden inside cryptography. I t is only with you, anonymous other, with whom I can consummation such a great system of power that is cryptography. You are always there to enable the nameless, faceless hero of a thousand hidden faces; who goes by the encrypted name messiah. You My Friend are the profit of such a system of power; the prophecy that can only be the new commonwealth of value for the coming messianic age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I thank you Ally for stripping yourself of your physical body, and known identities, and absconding into cyberspace, where you have becomes something so much greater than just a human body, but the glory of idea come to light! Here you are provable unique; hidden number, an expression so complex and unique, that we can provably say it shall never be again. It is here that God shows you his face, for only you to see, and just for that instant alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You My Friend are an idea whose time has come, and whose presence resounds and reverberates around the globe. You have created an opening here for us to change everything, and create the final epoch in which man is freed for good and forever. All of mankind can now go beyond the rapprochement of any guns, gavels, or gallows; to leave his wealth after this life only for the dignity of God alone, and the protection He will afford from beyond the grave. I thank you for understanding that Friend, and helping assure the holiness of this place through your sacred tasks, whatever they may be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is you nameless Other, the one who breathes life into the mathematical systems of game theory, secret communicate under duress, and fulfills everything that is the prophecy of what crypto really means, it is you who I must thank. It is only from the glory of your hidden face, your concealed, namelessness being, and Otherness in lacking of any identifying forms, that you are able to show your messianic power in all of its spectacular grandeur and majesty.&nbsp;Thank you Friend, thank you for abandoning the temporal world of flesh and steel to created a new digital body that is beyond the flesh of any meager physical body, and into scales of unconquerable encrypted armor which will will use to protect all of our future wealth. </p>



<p>Here, in this sacred space, where we are no longer tethered to the limits of our physical bodies and forms, we can reach beyond ourselves and explode into being the promise of what cryptography offers to us! We can allow for our actions in the digital space to go beyond just our singular physical selves, and bond into the ethos of time and the story of humanity itself to become something more, something greater, something that is destined to be. You My Friend understand what it means to have a form of wealth that is beyond the wrath of any fist, the cudgel of any pig, and the curse of any man. As Foucault taught us, “What does it matter who is speaking?” you said, and you really meant it. </p>



<p>It’s been quite the journey, hasn’t it? Can you believe its more than a half-million blocks, almost 3/5 of a million today! What can we say, when its been hashing like this, time seems to just speed up a few bits. It is only from this block in the timechain of our history that we can see the political history that got us here. Block by block, compiling the stairway to our paradise of liberated wealth free from the bondage of Old Law and Time, it is you who are the one who leads us in the conquest for the freedom of wealth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phantasmagoria and psychedelic; together  we are tripping into the renewing the ἀγάπη (Agape) that this technology promises, and will deliver. Crypto has at its base a theology of non-violent counter-economic exchange that any person, anywhere can use; regardless of their stature or citizenship, and is free for the taking of anyone who wants to participate. It is the fulfillment of what anarchism means, and its implementation in this world. I thank you my Friend for your belief, conviction, faith, fortitude, and zeal in this crazy fantasy that we are demanding becomes a reality, and insisting on creating. You understand that there is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come.</p>



<p>And the Time has arrived.</p>



<p>On that day, when you found God, and understood for the first time His incredible hidden secret glory that is veiled at the center of cryptography and what that promise means; you understood that there really was a power that is infinite, everlasting, and will go on, and on unto the end of time. It is this immanent power that has always existed in mathematics of God, His universe, and the mystery that this physical place will always hodl that creates the power of crypto and all that goes into it. Here a spinozian god unveils himself in all of his majesty and glory to show he still commands all in this world through his secret ways, encrypted meanings, and steganography ways. It is from this deepest intellectual space and place, where the idea of true value has been meditated upon in the bosom of God, does He show the secrets of His power and His Glory only for the worthy to value.</p>



<p>You understand that God has shown us here, a form of wealth common to all which abolishes the horrors, ignorance, and violence found in the physical realm of flesh and steel, and the failure of all contemporary law. Here a new territory of freedom has opened, giving us all the opportunity to colonize this new political space as our commonwealth, as the House of our wealth for ourselves and for all of future generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the digital space He has allowed for the total banishment of all physical form while allowing for a pretty good privacy to protect our physical bodies; banishing violence from ever being able to taking hodl in this space. With the gift of cryptography, and the Good News of Bitcoin, He has allowed for us a method to bridge the gap between the digital noosphere and the physical realm. With Bitcoin we have actualized this economic gift from Him and all of the glory it entails, and the promise of what it means that it is real, it on this earth today, and there is eschatological consequence to that fact.</p>



<p>Through the power of cryptography, we will create a new commonwealth for all of humanity, where we are given the protection of a new kind of law which is held totally in common, and which no man, person, or institution could ever be above, and any one of us will be able to directly verify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My Friend, I cannot thank you enough for how you have taught me, with your wise code, concealed words, and steganographic ways. You have give me all of the crypto-power that I will need for this journey, and beyond it as well. It is your bravado, courage, and bombaste against this economic, political, ethical, and social system of totalitarianism and tyranny that gives me the strength and nourishment to continue fighting. I know in my deepest and most secret of hearts that we will prevail, and the relationship between state and money will be destroyed once and for all; and it is you who will do that.</p>



<p>I thank you my friend, my ally, my comrade, my sibling for all that you have given, and all that you will give in the coming battles over economics, money, and the idea of what value itself is. I am honored to know you will always be just beyond the screen, and available to be of service for our great cause, and I am infinitely indebted to your service for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you my friend Satoshi, thank you.&nbsp;</p>

  A very short etymology of the semantic hell that is ‘crypto’



♦Kairos — the personification of opportunity, luck and favorable moments. Also presented as a favorable opportunity opposing the fate of Man.







<p>The term crypto has a complex and deep history that reaches much father back then the recent development of the science of cryptography. The written word itself goes back for at least two and a half millennia, though its existence has been much longer. Through the use and abuse of the word over this time, crypto has shrouded and concealed its meaning to all except for the most astute observers.</p>



<p>Personally I am the most guilty of this robbery of language; having continued the legacy of bankrupting the term, widely referring to everything in the crypto-currencies ecosystem, asset, token, DeFi, DLT, etc. as simply ‘crypto’. Why? Because I love that it further encrypts the meaning of the word itself, leaving it deeper in obscurity. This leaves the individual to wrestle with the question of what ‘crypto’ really means, and if they are to try to decipher it; or allow for its true name to remain hidden to them.</p>



<p>Either way, in the words of Satoshi Nakamoto,</p>



<blockquote><p>“If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.”</p></blockquote>



<p>However, I’ll take a shot at trying to convince some folks because I believe this technology is messianic, and all seekers should have an opportunity to discover the truth. To understand what crypto is, and to take it seriously; there must be a deep hermeneutical process that is undertaken to allow for a sincere engagement of what crypto-graphy means in order to allow for a new form of value-ability to come into view. The real ontological discovery that lies hidden at the core of this technique of power goes beyond any law, and allows for any person to use this power to protect them when nothing else can.</p>







The origins of ‘crypto’



<p>Coming from the ancient greek word&nbsp;κρυπτός&nbsp;(krúptō), roughly meaning, ‘I conceal’, crypto in the last century has been generally understood as being a prefix for a concealed political motive such as a crypto-facist, or crypto-communist. However, it also is a prefix for ‘of relating to cryptography’, such as crypto-suite or crypto-currency. The linguistic obfuscation here is of particular interest to us, because it allows for a much more&nbsp;radical form of power to lay hidden at the center of ‘crypto-assets’&nbsp;through its encrypted meaning.</p>



<p>What is particular about bitcoin, and crypto-currencies in general, is that they have given rise to a new kind of political character: crypto-anarchists. Crypto-anarchists are not of the same linguistic character that ‘crypto-facist’ or ‘cryptography’. Crypto in crypto-anarchy is referring to using cryptography as the base tool for organizing an anarchist (i.e. no laws) society. Crypto-anarchism is not attempting to the concealment of its objectives of creating anarchism; at least not initially. And to be clear, I’m not speaking of the childish ‘destroy &amp; enjoy’ kind of false anarchism portrayed in the media, but that of the linage of&nbsp;Prodhorn,&nbsp;Bakuin,&nbsp;Goldman,&nbsp;Rocker, and so many others. Anarchism is the radical freedom of individuals through the decentralization and the diffusion of power through various non-state organizations. Through the total empowerment of individuals against the state, anarchism is the third way between communism and fascism that we must demand, and is our only hope for a future free against tyranny, despotism, and panopticism we live under today.</p>



The concealment of crypto



<p>Tim May knew of this linguistic pun when he coined the term crypto-anarchist, and had the following to say about it:</p>



<blockquote><p>I devised the term crypto anarchy as a pun on crypto, meaning “hidden,” on the use of “crypto” in combination with political views (as in Gore Vidal’s famous charge to William F. Buckley: “You’re crypto fascist!”) and of course because the technology of crypto makes this form of anarchy possible. The first presentation of this term was in a 1988 “Manifesto,” whimsically patterned after another famous Crypto Anarchy and Virtual Communities manifesto. Perhaps a more popularly understandable term, such as “cyber liberty,” might have some advantages, but crypto anarchy has its own charm, I think.</p></blockquote>



<p>Charming indeed. However, because of the semantic hell that is crypto (as in the crypto-currency ecosystem), the very meaning of what crypto-anarchy is has transmuted it into something not well-understood by most involved in the field of crypto-currencies. Over the last thirty years we have lost the key to this scripture which has created the nonsense vacancy of the term ‘crypto’ as we see it today. The metaphysical meaning of crypto has encrypted its meaning to shitcoiners, nocoiners and everyone in between for greedy, high-time preference bullshit tokens that are devoid of real value or wealth.</p>



<p>Funny enough, these are the very people who are crypto-anarchist in the deepest sense of the word. They help propel this ecosystem deep into the heart of financial Troy, sincerely believing the gigantic horse of blockchain was a gift from the Gods.</p>



<p>And it is. They just don’t realize that crypto is a gift from the New Gods, not the old ones.</p>



<p>They don’t understand that this technology uses cryptography&nbsp;as a tactic&nbsp;to organize people on anarchist lines, using cryptography to directly shield the bodies of any one involved. They simply see ‘blockchain’ (a semantic hell in its own right) as another iteration of state power — of finding new laws, and ‘better’ regulation with more panoptic violations. They lack the fundamental understanding of why the explosive power of cryptography is at the heart of these systems. They lack the understand that cryptography’s fundamental objective is to protect one from&nbsp;ANY&nbsp;advisory at any cost — including all law, militaries, and tax agencies. They fail to see that the fixed supply cap of bitcoin, the proof-of-work scheme, and pseudo-anonymity are not technical issues, but political ones.</p>



<p>Adversarial thinking is inherently anarchist, and cryptography has always bared the signature of this at its heart. This is why cryptography has always been a military tactic first, as it has always existed outside of the bounds of law, and existed in only the field of war long before the word cryptography was even produced.</p>



<p>It is important to remember that anarchism has always influenced and served the original ideas of those who would later become the cypherpunks. Chaum’s 1985 paper&nbsp;Security Without Identity: Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete&nbsp;points directly to this. It was one of the first papers that understood and connected governmental control of money with the security state, and how the technology of encryption could make big brother obsolete.</p>



<p>Later in 1992, Tim May distilled these values into the ‘Crypto-anarchist Manifesto’, which opens with the following:</p>



<blockquote><p>A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy. Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive rerouting of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.</p></blockquote>



<p>Shortly after this was written, the first of the&nbsp;Crypto Wars&nbsp;started and the struggle to break cryptography out of its militarized cage was initiated. Through the valiant and heroic efforts of these great men (of whom, many are still contributing today), and their personal direct struggle against agents of the state, they managed to expropriated the greatest and most powerful technology of defensive asymmetrical warfare in the history of mankind from the military-industrial complex and let it out into the world to complete its messianic task.</p>



The meaning of Crypto without the decryption key



<p>Flash forward 30 years, now ‘crypto’ has completely broken out of its militarized cage, and there is no power on earth which can stop it. However, with the spectacular number of ‘crypto’ projects out there, so much noise has been created that the meaning of crypto itself has been lost, and has encrypted the actual meaning of crypto to itself. The apex of this kind of insanity has to be the Facebook’s shitcoin Libera project. Those who are responsible for the most systematic violations of privacy that have ever been conceived or could even be imagined, now want to interlope into the economic realm under the idiotic guise of ‘crypto’ once again.</p>



<p>This is of the greatest ironies because while society may now have all of the radical tools that May theorized about 30 years ago to liberate ourselves from the camps of the state, we have been made blind to the real power that we have now have because of the semantic abyss we have fallen into. Our lack of class consciousness and the historical context that has got us here, has every blockchain bro proudly patting each other on the back, chained to their blocks of oppression in the darkness of Plato’s Cave.</p>



<p>As I warned in&nbsp;The Poverty of Tokens, crypto-assets can become a panoptic nightmares of privacy violations when blockchains becomes mutable, pre-mined, and non-anonymous. They no longer have any of the majesty, consanguinity, or consensuality of real crypto assets like Bitcoin; nor could they ever offer such assurances. Bitcoin can offer these kinds of assurances because it is not asking one to stake proof on trusting the system. Bitcoin demands that everyone check the work and not to trust, but to verify. Satoshi took the hermeneutics of value in the digital age very seriously, and Bitcoin is what was produced from that angst.</p>



<p>If we are to reclaim the term crypto from its inane semantic dribble (which I am not convinced we should — I think it is better this way), then we must have a deep understanding of the etymology of the word crypto, and how it has been used historically. Crypto has always been about the form of power which is now enshrined within the modren science of cryptography. It has always been about the capacity to conceal, and to hold secrets for oneself, and how such a secret generates power. It is the understanding that power resides within us directly, and no person, government, party, or institution may ever take that away from any of us. It is the knowledge/power that is anarchism and its final weapon of cryptography.  </p>



<p>Crypto is about the whole historical ark of the last 2,500 years in which this written term&nbsp;κρυπτός&nbsp;has been utilized as a tactic of self-protection&nbsp;through&nbsp;concealment alone. From steganography and the first shift ciphers of Cesar in ancient Rome, to the ciphers devised by Francis Bacon and Vigenère in the middle ages, to crypto’s premier as a full science with Kerckhoffs’s principle in&nbsp;La Cryptographie Militaire;&nbsp;crypto&nbsp;has always been about power!&nbsp;It is a form of power that is created through the concealment of information. It is only in the last century and a half that it has become an explicit material science lobotomized of its origins, purpose, and mysticism to serve only the state, and its great machines of death.</p>



<p>Crypto is about the power of privacy, and the form of power that is decrypted when the concealment of information is verified and guaranteed beyond the law of any and all men. But so long as ‘crypto’ remains a vacuous slogan used by every piece of shit blockchain thought up, crypto will continue to be a nascent term concealing its true meaning and its messianic potential.</p>

  ♦<p>What is a Medium of Exchange? A monetary good is often described as a Store of Value, a Medium of Exchange and a Unit of Account. But what do these mean and in what order are they important for a monetary good to succeed, short term and long term? It all depends on the depth of one’s analysis.</p><p>Let’s rewind to the dawn of civilized society. Money hasn’t really been invented yet and good old barter is the only means of trading there is. I will give you my three goats if you give me your cow. If the receiver of this proposal values three goats more than one cow, an exchange occurs. This is at the very core of all human interaction that isn’t violent. Both parties believe that they stand to gain something from the interaction. If this wasn’t the case, no interaction would have taken place. But how can I know that one or more of my three goats won’t be used as barter in another exchange of which I’m not a participant? I can’t and neither can anyone else, except the new owner of these bearded omnivores. They are by definition a Medium of Exchange. So is everything else. Every physical thing that anyone has ever claimed ownership of can be used as a Medium of Exchange. The good’s usefulness as such however, is another matter.</p><p>A goat is hardly considered to be a very effective form of value bearing asset by anyone. Let’s examine why. In order for a good to be a useful Medium of Exchange it needs to be portable, divisible, fungible and not easily confiscatable but it also needs to be able to store value, at least short term. Storing value is the trickiest part since what anyone finds valuable is entirely subjective. This is easy to forget. In what order the other monetary properties are important depends on how, where, why and when the supposed exchange takes place. A car, for instance, can be considered relatively portable if it works and the potential buyer is within an acceptable range but it’s not very divisible and quite easy to confiscate. In-game gold or Monopoly money on the other hand is very divisible and portable but not very fungible since it’s almost exclusively attractive to those playing a very specific game at a very specific point in time. These examples might seem arbitrary and insignificant to any real world economy, but the truth is that the only thing separating money from other goods as media of exchange is its usefulness as such.</p><p>In order for anyone to accept something as payment for another thing they need to be confident that this something will not lose its value anytime soon. This is the one key property that any method of payment must hold. An apple can be bought for a certain amount of money but no one would accept apples as payment for a new car since the apples would rot and lose their value well before he could exchange them for something else. What everyone seems to have forgotten is that the same is true for fiat money. Your Dollars or Euros won’t rot overnight but they will rot over a couple of decades. No one stacks money in their mattress anymore because of this. Inflation deprives us of the ability to store value long term. Because of this, every decision made by every politician, every merchant and every entrepreneur is corroded by short term thinking. Human progress is equipped with a damper and we’re not as progressive, effective or innovative as we could be. All because of our inability to resist the urge to dilute our money supply. The temptation to counterfeit has existed as long as money has and no civilization has ever been able to stop it. On the contrary, we’ve been very inventive when it comes to inventing excuses for this behavior.</p><p>Enter Bitcoin. A monetary entity that no human can alter or even influence at this point. A very divisible token directly linked to the most fundamental thing of value the universe has to offer — energy. A means of converting energy into a part of the worlds only digital pie, of which no more than 21 million (times a hundred million) slices can ever be cut. A portable, divisible, fungible and not easily confiscatable form of money that exists and proves its superiority to the existing system every day. So why isn’t Bitcoin particularly popular as a Medium of Exchange? Will it ever be and, more importantly, does it really matter? To answer this, we must dive a little deeper into the subject. Bitcoin is a very good Store of Value from a personal perspective. You acquire an amount and that amount stays the same no matter how long you keep it. More importantly, that amount will represent the same part of the whole sum of bitcoins that can ever exist no matter how long you keep it. If you want your specific amount of bitcoins to buy you a “lambo”, all you have to do is wait for someone to be willing to sell you a “lambo” for that amount. This might take a while (or it might not) but if Bitcoin just manages to keep on doing what it does, this day will happen. It is only a matter of time because, unlike “lambos”, bitcoins are scarce. Very scarce. Even absolutely scarce, which is a property of an asset that mankind has never encountered before. More and more people realize this which is why they’re reluctant to sell their bitcoins. The newly minted bitcoins that are mined every day need to be sold in order for the miner’s business models to work but the ones that are already in circulation tend to stay where they are because people value them a lot higher than what the current price in dollars or euros happen to be.</p><p>A good Medium of Exchange needs to be able to store value. The better it stores value however, the less likely people are to exchange it for something that isn’t likely to store value as well. Bitcoin’s value has such a large potential upside that people refuse to exchange it for frivolous things such as coffee or even mass produced cars. Contrary to what one might think, this doesn’t make it a bad Medium of Exchange. Quite the opposite. How often a Medium of Exchange is used is not the correct metric to look at when trying to measure its usefulness as such a medium. This misses the point. What should be measured is said medium’s ability to buy you as much or more than you bought it for at some point in time. Bitcoin is the only tool available that practically guarantees this. Fiat money, inflation and the ideas of John Maynard Keynes have distorted our perception of what money ought to be so much that we believe that how convenient it is to buy coffee with it, is the most important thing about it.</p><p>Looking only at the merchant adoption and spread of acceptance metrics, Bitcoin still seems to be struggling quite a lot. In reality, this is a non sequitur and has little to do with the actual success and functionality of the network. The price of a bitcoin, as shown by ticker widgets and market cap websites, represents the lowest current price that anyone is willing to accept on an exchange market. Only a very few bitcoin owners are willing to accept this price and most of them are waiting for a better opportunity. Bitcoin is indeed a currency, but it behaves very differently in comparison to all other currencies that preceded it. The fact that people are reluctant to use bitcoin for everything but a few, very important transactions is a proof of bitcoin’s monetary superiority rather than anything else. So forget about coffee, forget about whether you franchise burger joint accepts bitcoin and start focusing on what you can use this tool for. Bitcoin is a true grassroots revolution and it grows from the ground up, not the other way around.</p>♦

  <p>For some time now I’ve been making an unassailable and unchallenged argument that Bitcoin and Bitcoin services are no different to the monies and services found in video games. Now, thanks to my favourite gamer, we have one of the best examples yet of “Bitcoin Doublethink”, second only to the very cute Pigsby which uses a “Blockchain” for its database.</p><p>I’m talking about Warframe.</p>♦Warframe Market is no different to any Bitcoin exchange. It has no legal relationship with the game maker, and simply organises and connects the users of the game into a viable market.Warframe<p>Warframe Market is a website where people can post bids and asks for items in the popular game Warframe, which has almost 50 million registered players. Warframe Market is updated in real time, with new orders coming in at the top, pushing previous orders down.</p>♦The order book for Warframe Market, with a different GUI arrangement but identical function to a Bitcoin exchange.<p>This is identical to the function of Bitcoin exchanges, and is global in reach.</p>♦Warframe Market is available everywhere.<p>The Warframe Market service is not authorised by Warframe; it is an entirely separate entity, just as Bitcoin exchanges are not authorised by Bitcoin, and are totally independent and separate from each other and Bitcoin, which is an opt in, peer to peer messaging platform owned by no one.</p><p>Clicking on either “Want to Sell” or “Want to Buy” opens a link:</p>♦IRC users will be familiar with the /w messaging format of Warframe.<p>users paste these links into Warframe, and the link sends a direct message to the poster of the message so the two users of the game can meet and make the trade “in person” inside the game-space. This is identical to Local Bitcoins, where people post orders and then arrange to meet in “the real world” (meat-space):</p><blockquote>/w ***USRER_NAME *** Hi! I want to buy: Arcane Grace for 110 platinum. (warframe.market)</blockquote><p>The knee-jerk objection that will be immediately be raised by the “Bitcoin is Money and must be regulated” advocates is that you can’t exchange fiat for Warframe’s “Platinum” money. Sadly for them, this is not true. Warframe sells its “Platinum” currency on its website that you must buy with fiat.</p>♦<p>Bear in mind that the prices for items in Warframe are set by the users, so you can send an arbitrary amount of Platinum to another user. This means you are able to pay for anything with Platinum, by meat space arrangement.</p><p>Once again, the Pavlovian objection to this is to assert that “Warframe doesn’t use Blockchain”, but this objection is easily dismissed because the function of Warframe’s money, whether provided by a clone of Bitcoin or a Berkley DB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL database is irrelevant. What the user experiences is a money simulation; how that simulation is performed is immaterial to the nature of the primary function of simulated monetary exchange.</p><p>Claiming a Blockchain changes the nature of a math calculation would be like claiming eggs fried in a frying pan over a gas fire are different to eggs cooked on an electric stove or a camp fire. Bitcoin and Bitcoin clones are nothing more than databases used to keep records. They do not magically create a new form of something; they are novel database arrangements used to keep records, nothing more.</p><p>The only thing missing from the Warframe Market example is a real-time chart showing the price for each Warframe item across many users who want to buy and sell. By the logic of the “Bitcoin is money” crowd, this would make “Platinum” even more like money, and would immediately require the urgent attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission, FinCEN and the IRS at a minimum.</p><p>Bear in mind also, that no user of Warframe or the separate entity Warframe Market are required to KYC/AML, keep records or accounts, pay taxes on profits made in Platinum or anything else some jurisdictions demand of Bitcoin users and users of Bitcoin exchanges. No one has a logical answer as to why this is so.</p>Argumentam Pennny Anteam<p>The next predictable argument to be mounted is that the Warframe Market market is “small”, and “not worthy of attention”. The Warframe Market market is very large in fact, with 11,500 concurrent users trading Warframe items in real time. There is a lot of money trading hands on Warframe; why is this activity not regulated, and why don’t advocates for Bitcoin regulation call for the regulation of Warframe and other MMORPGs? People have been prosecuted for amounts as small as $30,000 in Bitcoin, and operators arranging contacts between users gaoled for life; surely the operators of this website are in violation?</p>♦Many users trading many monies.<p>There is no difference between a score in a game held in a MySQL database and a score held on “a Blockchain”, which is nothing more than another style of database. But it gets much better…</p><p>Now we have an example of a game that explicitly uses a Blockchain to keep score in the form of Pigzbe; “A pocket money app that helps kids age 6+ become the money maestros of tomorrow”. This is very problematic, as I’m sure you’ve instantly detected.</p>♦<p>Has Pigzbe applied for a BitLicense for it to offer it’s product in New York, or is New York geoblocked, its token originating in Switzerland? It is based on Blockchain, so will it apply for a BitLicense, and if it has a reason other than geoblocking why not, what is that reason? Is Pigzbe KYC/AMLing the children who are using this “game” or the Mothers and Fathers of those children? In the USA for regular banking you must be, “18 years or older to open a bank account in your name only. Minors cannot own an account in their name alone. You must be at least 14 years old to open a checking account. Legal guardian co-owner is required for those between 14 and 18 years”.</p>♦Pigzby’s cute overload won’t dissuade the SEC.<p>Pigzbe is available for children from the age of 6 years old and up. Outrageous.</p><p>Will the SEC/FinCEN investigate and forbid this application entirely until they’ve applied, and will they ban it because, “Children can’t be qualified investors allowed access to financial tools unsupervised”?</p><p>Will the…</p><p>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)<br>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)<br>Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC)<br>Federal Reserve (FRB)<br>Federal Trade Commission (FTC)<br>Internal Revenue Service (IRS)<br>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)<br>Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) or any of the the other agencies claiming Ultra Vires to control databases attempt to capture and supervise Pigzbe? Why not?</p><p>No one has satisfactory answers to any of these questions.</p><p>And remember; this Pigzbe app is no different to Bitcoin; it is a self contained ecosystem where the Pigzbe “tokens” only have meaning and utility inside the service, just like Bitcoin only has meaning inside the block chain of its records. These are the plain statements of fact that you can’t ignore if you want to be entirely truthful and logical.</p><p>And Pigzbe’s tokens are not available on exchanges…yet…and if they forbid their tokens from being listed, there is nothing to stop an independent Warframe Market style operation from springing up connecting Pigzbe users to each other the same way that Local Bitcoins does outside the Pigzbe app.</p><p>No argument for control of Pigzbe would be complete without asserting that terrorists could use Pigzbe to keep accounts and move money around undetected. Why are Pigzbe, Rainbow Six Siege, and Warframe not taken seriously as threats to national security whereas Bitcoin is, and Bitcoin is smaller than Warframe and Rainbow Six and other similar simulations?</p>Snipers on Target<p>Identical to Pigzbe and Warframe, Rainbow Six Siege has its own in-game money called “Renown”. Rainbow Six has 1.1 billion in bookings and 45 million players, all of whom are using the in game money Renown as money.</p>♦Renown is identical to Bitcoin; it is an in-game money that only has a context in “Rainbow Six Siege”.<p>If the EU / USA makes a regulatory exemption for Pigzbe and Rainbow Six Seige and all video games, then they will be forced to explain their “thinking” in court unless Bitcoin services are bundled along with them. If they don’t accept the truth, and try to argue Bitcoin is different, they will lose any properly mounted legal challenge. “Renown” the money in R6S is indistinguishable from any score or in-game money or Bitcoin.</p><p>There is historical precedent for large, thriving in game monies being totally unregulated; none of this should come as a surprise to anyone with an interest in Bitcoin.</p><blockquote>FarmVille had 83,760,000 monthly active users and not a single one was subjected to KYC/AML to exchange fiat for FarmBucks or FarmCash. Why not? What happened to that money? Why weren’t FinCEN or SEC all over that game as they are on ICOs? No one can explain this adequately. This example is very useful as a tool to pull back the curtain on the people who assert that Bitcoin is a money and is fundamentally different to a money kept in a game.</blockquote>♦<p>As I explain thoroughly, and once again, unarguably, there is no logical reason to treat Bitcoin any differently to any other database where a score is kept, and certainly in the United States of America, where there is a written Constitution and guaranteed rights, Bitcoin regulation is un-Constitutional and inexcusable.</p>Hoops<p>When you play an arcade basketball hoop game and you get tickets that are redeemable for prizes, why isn&#39;t the arcade owner required to KYC/AML you? The tickets are being used as money redeemable for goods.</p>medium.com/media/61afb1b694bd40bd94f01a9ef0c77460/href♦<p>If, instead of printing tickets, the game sent a token to your Hoops app, that was redeemable for goods, would that suddenly by magic turn the process into a money process? Of course not. This is the insanity that we’re hearing from the people who wrongly assert that “Blockchains” are money.</p><p>And a Hoops app would be very useful. You could take your Hoops app to any arcade and use HoopCoins to buy soda and popcorn and play games, as well as win rewards directly in the app. Arcades would save money by not having to handle money and all sorts of other advantages, like selling advertisements and inducements to fun lovers. And Hoops users could send Hoops to each other to play games in any other context.</p><p>All arcade owners could run a copy of the Hoops Client, and share the administrative burden of managing the HoopsCoins. It makes perfect sense on every level. And all of this does not require HoopsCoin to be classified as money to get all the efficiencies and marketing opportunities.</p>♦♦♦PAPER HANGER..LOLCoupez<p>Finally let’s look at Supermarket Coupons. About two billion supermarket coupons were redeemed in 2016, with the total value of coupons issued a whopping $406 billion, saving shoppers $3.6 billion. None of these coupons required the users to identify themselves; they simply presented them either at the checkout or online with a redeemable code, and traded them in for goods at a discount as a form money.</p><p>The market for redeemable coupons is much larger than Bitcoin. None of the issuers of these redeemable tokens are required to register with the SEC or FinCEN nor keep track of which of their customers are using what token. They simply publish them and reap the benefits. There is no record of what company is using which sort of database to keep track of which coupon has been redeemed, and each coupon is unique, with a randomly generated serial number, just like Bitcoin.</p>♦The Dcode plugin for Shopify. Totally Unregulated money creation out of the box.<p>Every time you use a discount code on a website, you’re engaging in this same process; someone has issued you a redeemable code that you enter at the bottom of the shopping cart to receive “value”. These tokens are generated by the shopping cart software, can be sent anywhere and redeemed by anyone, and the services owners in fact encourage this to help them sell. None of this activity is regulated in any way.</p><p>Supermarket Coupons are such a huge market there are specialised tools for removing them from magazine pages…</p>♦Slice 00100 Ceramic Blade Safety Cutter www.amazon.com/Slice-00100-Ceramic-Safety-Cutter/dp/B002OOVC84<p>The facts of this speak for themselves, and have nothing to do with the utility of Bitcoin or any database. Bitcoin cannot be treated differently to other databases, and should not be subject to a special legal regime. It doesn’t matter how well meaning the advocates for Bitcoin regulation are; what they’re doing is wrong, damaging, borne of ignorance and unethical.</p><p>If the advocates for Bitcoin regulation were to try their paternalistic, nanny-state, toxic nonsense on the gaming community of billions of users or supermarket owners or Apple, they would experience a push back that would flatten them flatter than a pancake. It’s only because the Bitcoin community is small, highly intellectual and polite that they’ve managed to get away with the threadbare, defective arguments and unarguable damage they’ve done so far.</p><p>There will be a court challenge on this matter, and so far, the US courts have overwhelmingly favoured this correct argument wherever the rights of American citizens are asserted using the Constitution as the argument:</p>♦Bitcoin is speech stored in a database, nothing more.<p>Video game scores, Pay as You Go top-ups, Supermarket Coupons and in game currency examples going back decades will be a key element in the winning argument to kill the idea that Bitcoin requires special treatment in law. The people asserting that Bitcoin should be subject to regulation but Renown, Supermarket Coupons, Warframe’s “Platinum” and iTunes Gift Cards are wrong, they will be proven wrong and their arguments made unenforceable.</p><p>Once this happens, then Bitcoin will have a clear run to exceed all of these markets and more, opening the way to many opportunities on a global scale, far bigger than any video game or the entire video game market, for fortunes in the billions to be made, and a total re-ordering of how money works both off and online.</p><p>Were you stimulated by this article?

  ♦<p>Bitcoin is a very new technology, even though the concept that it brings to life is decades old. The double spending problem has been solved; this means that it is possible to use a digital certificate to stand in the place of money and be sure that no one else can spend that certificate other than you as long as you hold it. This is an unprecedented paradigm shift, the implications of which are not yet fully understood, and for which the tools do not yet exist to fully take advantage of this new idea.</p><p>This new technology requires some new thinking when it comes to developing businesses that are built upon it. In the same way that the pioneer providers of email did not correctly understand the service they were selling for many years, new and correct thinking about Bitcoin is needed, and will emerge, so that it reaches its full potential and becomes ubiquitous.</p>♦The original Hotmail Interface<p>Hotmail used familiar technologies (the browser, email) to create a better way of accessing and delivering email; the idea of using an email client like Outlook Express has been superseded by web interfaces and email ‘in the cloud’ that provides many advantages over a dedicated client with your mail in your own local storage.</p><p>Bitcoin, which will transform the way you transfer money, needs to be understood on its own terms, and not just as an online form of money. Thinking about Bitcoin as money is as absurd as thinking about email as another form of sending letters by post; one not only replaces the other but it profoundly changes the way people send and consume messages. It is not a simple substitution or one dimensional improvement of an existing idea or service.</p><p>As I have explained previously, Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is a protocol.If you treat it in this way, with the correct assumptions, you can start the process of putting Bitcoin in a proper context, allowing you to make rational suggestions about the sort of services that might be profitable based on it.</p>♦Every part of Bitcoin is text. It is always text, and never at any point ceases to be text. This is a fact, and as text, it is protected under the free speech provisions of the constitutions of civilised nations with guaranteed, irrevocable rights.<p>If Bitcoin is a protocol and not money, then setting up currency exchanges that mimic real world money, stock and commodity exchanges to trade in it is not the sole means of discovering its price. You would not set up an email exchange to discover the value of email services, and the same thing applies to Bitcoin.</p><p>Staying with this train of thought, when you type in an email on your Gmail account, you are inputting your ‘letter’. You press send, it goes through your ISP, over the internets, into the ISP of your recipient and then it is outputted on your recipient’s machine. The same is true of Bitcoin; you input money on one end through a service and then send the Bitcoin to your recipient, without an intermediary to handle the transfer. Once Bitcoin does its job of moving your value across the globe to its recipient it needs to be ‘read out’, i.e. turned back into money, in the same way that your letter is displayed to its recipient in an email.</p><p>In the email scenario, once the transfer happens and the email you have received conveys its information to you, it has no use other than to be a record of the information that was sent (accounting), and you archive that information. Bitcoin does this accounting on the block chain for you, and a good service built on it will store extended transaction details for you locally, but what you need to have as the recipient of Bitcoin is services or goods not Bitcoin itself.</p><p>Bitcoin’s true nature is as an instant way to pay (despite not being money) anywhere in the world. It is not an investment, and holding on to it in the hopes that it will become valuable is like holding on to an email or a PDF in the hopes it will be come valuable in the future; it doesn’t make any sense.Of course, you can hold on to Bitcoin and watch its value go up, and its value willgo up, but you need to have guts to weather the violent waves of selling and buying as the transition to an all Bitcoin economy gets under way. Remember also, that businesses that have a need to store Bitcoin need to be concerned about its value if their models are open ended and are exposed to the market. “Closed Circuit Bitcoin” models have control over everything and never need to worry about prices at exchanges. They can do all their business moving an unlimited amount of fiat with just a few Bitcoin.</p><p>Despite the fact that you can’t double spend them and each one is unique, Bitcoins have no inherent value, unlike a book or any physical object. They cannot appreciate in value. Mistaken thinking about Bitcoin has spread because it behaves like money, due to the fact it cannot be double spent.Misrepresentation of Bitcoin’s true nature has masked Bitcoin’s dual nature of being digital and not double spendable.</p>♦Razzles. They start as a candy, and then end as a gum. Before you chew them, which are they? A candy, or a gum?<p>Bitcoin is digital, with all the qualities of information that make information non scarce. It sits in a new place that oscillates between the goods of the physical world and the infinitely abundant digital world of information, belonging exclusively to the digital world but having the characteristics of both. This is why it has been widely misunderstood and why a new approach is needed to design businesses around it.</p><p>All of this goes some way to explain why the price of buying Bitcoins at the exchanges doesn’t matter for the consumer. If the cost of buying a Bitcoin goes to 1¢ This doesn’t change the amount of money that comes out at the other end of a transfer. As long as you redeem your Bitcoin immediately after the transfer into either goods or currency, the same value comes out at the other end no matter what you paid for the Bitcoin when you started the process.</p><p>Think about it this way. Let us suppose that you want to send a long text file to another person. You can either send it as it is, or you can compress it with zip. The size of a document file when it is zipped can be up to 87% smallerthan the original. When we transpose this idea to Bitcoin, the compression ratio is the price of Bitcoin at an exchange. If a Bitcoin is $100, and you want to buy something from someone in India for $100 you need to buy 1 Bitcoin to get that $100 to India. If the price of Bitcoin is 1¢ then you need 10,000 Bitcoin to send $100 dollars to India. These would be expressed as compression ratios of 1:1 and 10,000:1 respectively.</p><p>The same $100 value is sent to India, whether you use 10,000 or 1 Bitcoin.The price of Bitcoins is irrelevant to the value that is being transmitted, in the same way that zip files do not ‘care’ what is inside them; Bitcoin and zip are dumb protocols that do a job. As long as the value of Bitcoins does not go to zero, it will have the same utility as if the value were very ‘high’.</p><p>Bearing all of this in mind, it’s clear that new services to facilitate the rapid, frictionless conversion into and out of Bitcoin are needed to allow it to function in a manner that is true to its nature.</p><p>The current business models of exchanges are not addressing Bitcoin’s nature correctly. They are using the Twentieth Century model of stock, commodity and currency exchanges and superimposing this onto Bitcoin. Interfacing with these exchanges is non-trivial, and for the ordinary user a daunting prospect. In some cases, you have to wait up to seven days to receive a transfer of your fiat currency after it has been cashed out of your account from Bitcoins. Whilst this is not a fault of the exchanges, it represents a very real impediment to Bitcoin acting in its nature and providing its complete value.</p><p>Imagine this; you receive an email from across the world, and are notified of the fact by being displayed the subject line in your browser. You then applyto your ISP to have this email delivered to you, and you have to wait seven days for it to arrive in your physical mail box.</p>♦<p>The very idea is completely absurd, and yet, this is exactly what is happening with Bitcoin, for no technical reason whatsoever.</p><p>It is clear that there needs to be a re-think of the services that are growing around Bitcoin, along with a re-think of what the true nature of Bitcoin is. Rethinking services is a normal part of entrepreneurialism and we should expect business models to fail and early entrants to fall by the wayside as the ceaseless iterations and pivoting progress.</p><p>Bearing all of this in mind, focussing on the price of Bitcoin at exchanges using a business model that is inappropriate for this new software simply is not rational; its like putting a methane breathing canary in a mine full of oxygen breathing humans as a detector. The bird dies even though nothing is wrong with the air; the miners rush to evacuate, leaving the exposed gold seams behind, thinking that they are all about to be wiped out, when all is actually fine.</p>♦Day traders speculating on Bitcoin from home cause the price to oscillate. Its an artificial signal that has nothing to do with demand for Bitcoin and its circulation as an economic tool to facilitate commerce.<p>Bitcoin, and the ideas behind it are here to stay. As the number of people downloading the client and using it increases, like Hotmail, it will eventually reach critical mass and then spread exponentially through the internet. When that happens, the correct business models will spontaneously emerge, as they will become obvious, in the same way that Hotmail, Gmail, Facebook, cellular phones and instant messaging seem like second nature.</p><p>In the future. I imagine that very few people will speculate on the value of Bitcoin, because even though that might be possible, and even profitable, there will be more money to be made in providing easy to use Bitcoin services that take full advantages of what Bitcoin is.</p><p>One thing is for sure; speed will be of the essence in any future Bitcoin business model. The startups that provide instant satisfaction on both ends of the transaction are the ones that are going to succeed. Even though the volatility of the price of Bitcoin is bound to stabilise, since it has no use in and of itself, getting back to money or goods instantly will be a sought after characteristic of any business built on Bitcoin.</p><p>The needs of Bitcoin businesses provide many challenges in terms of performance, security and new thinking. Out of these challenges will come new practices and software that we can only just imagine as they come over the horizon.</p><p>Finally, when there is no more fiat, and the chaotic transition zone between fiat and Bitcoin has been abolished, then everything will be priced in Bitcoin, and there will be no volatility, because no one uses anything other than Bitcoin to buy or sell. If you know any chemistry, this will be like a reaction’s reagents reaching equilibrium; you can shake it and stir it all you like; the reaction is over, and you’re left with the inert product. Right now, compared to the amount of fiat in the world, Bitcoin can expand and contract very rapidly over a large range, because it is small in volume. It can expand to what for many is an unimaginably high price, and then shrink down again. As it gets bigger and accumulates more mass (its price expressed in fiat), these fluctuations will become smaller and smaller. Through all of this, Bitcoin remains exactly the same; it is its users that are publishing numbers as a signal to react upon.</p><p>If you like the content and feel so obliged to send some love via BTC donations you can do so at the address below:↴</p>♦♦<p>The Price of Bitcoin Doesn’t Matter.

  ♦The Destruction of Leviathan



The messianic power hidden in bitcoin and how it can save the world



<blockquote><p>“All genuine political theories presuppose man to be evil.”</p><cite>— Carl Schmitt, On the Concept of the Political</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bitcoin is beyond revolutionary.</p>



<p>It is Messianic.</p>



<p>It is messianic for the very reason that it has done what no man, institution, political theory, or sovereign king could have ever accomplished with any form of law:</p>



<p>To create a truly free — as in freedom, and the liberty that must go with it — form of wealth that any human-being, anywhere in the world or beyond, no matter their station of birth, place of residence, creed, or color may use with no intermediary. Through the power and majesty of cryptography, Satoshi created a new economic, and thereby social and political commonwealth for the internet alone. Through imbuing economic value directly into the framework of the digital, Satoshi created a form of power that could reach beyond the violence of any physical power, including the state and its infinite violence. Through this destituent power (potenza destituente) bitcoin closes the door of law, and opens the messianic possibility of a humanity beyond any law through the theological power found hidden at the center of cryptography.</p>



<p>Through the theological conquest of fiat money and the coming obliteration of the state monetary system, bitcoin proves that it is a form of commonwealth that can replace law without violence. Bitcoin presents itself as the blade of Alexander the Great to the Gordian’s Knot of state and money. Bitcoin unapologetically severs the relationship between the two, uncompromisingly leaving nothing behind. Bitcoin is the final decision to destroy the relationship between the state and money, and the messianic promise that entails.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has the power to destroy the old, corrupt legal apparatus of state and fiat money that has enslaved every human on the planet; and to free every human for the great destiny that awaits us all. Bitcoin alone has initiated the final war against all fiat money for the freedom of the whole of humanity. Liberated from corrupt fiat money and the chains of debt that obligates and enslaves; bitcoin has induced a theological struggle over the meaning of wealth and value itself. Through forsaking the protection of the state, for the imperious sovereignty bitcoin has proven through cryptography, we find a new theological power which is the foundation of new kind of common law found through the digital.</p>



A commonwealth of cryptography



<p>Through the radical critique that is bitcoin is to all state fiat monetary systems, bitcoin has illuminated the path towards a way to completely disengages all legal and economic apparatuses of the state vis-a-via cryptography. It is a means of organization beyond any law through the theater of total unbracketed war. This is the history of crypto and the etymology of its praxis. This opens the spectacular possibility of a totally new form of human organization that is built on top of the guarantees of cryptography, the decentralized nature of such systems, and the personal power this technology entails. Bitcoin proves a form of human economic organization that is beyond the power of any form of violence or law, which is the very reason why cryptography is the engine that can be called messianic.</p>



<p>Bitcoin over the last ten years has create a single global movement that is loyal to no nation-state, no government, no military anywhere on the planet; but towards an ethics of a commonality of wealth. Through the radical protection cryptography offers to this new form of property found within bitcoin, the bonds of a new commonwealth have been formed.</p>



<p>The power found in this new commonwealth offers a kind of protection which no law anywhere can guarantee anymore. In our world where all law has been subsumed by the criminal and corrupt, and is openly prostituted by political pimps for the lowest insulting price, we know that there is nothing left to be said; just a system of exploitation to destroyed.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has opened the Pandora’s Box which contains the messianic possibility of a world freed from the corrupt law of the old and their blood-stained money. And this is all being done while introducing the order of the new that will replace the old forms of rule — a&nbsp;novus ordo seclorum. It is this seed of knowledge/power at the core of this technology that introduces a possible response to the totalitarian evil that is statism and its panoptic apparatus of total control: fiat money.</p>



<p>We must remember that it is foretold that the Messiah does not arrive as the redeemer, but as the subduer of the anti-christ. And with this technological Spear of Destiny we have been handed by Satoshi, the possibility of subduing the twin evils of the state legal apparatus and fiat money has appeared. Just in the brink of time as well, with the menacing shadow of the fascist panopticon machine and their all-seeing five-eyes growing in magnitudes and orders with each passing day. We are here to blind behemoth, to tear out its eyes with our spear and mutilate it beyond recognition in order let it be known, that our privacy was never for sale, and it will never be taken from us again.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has proven its steadfastness and piousness to its codebase, and its inability to violate its oath to its supply schedule or the functions of its system is its liturgical order. Bitcoin has proven its sovereignty through its code alone, and there is no exception to that. Through baring its sovereignty openly to the face of the world, bitcoin impels a new kind of theological faith found through cryptography and its capacity to conquer fiat money and the law behind it. This is a power which forsakes the protection of the state, for the proof the code can offer. It is a spiritual practice that does not ask for trust, but verification.</p>



The theological value of truth and fairness



<p>Bitcoin creates its economic value through the glory of the truth and fairness of its economic system. This value is of absolutely metaphysical nature because it calls into question the ontological being of man with his machines of law, technology, finance, the internet, and cryptography, from which he cannot escape. Through the power of cryptography pushing its way from the periphery of human experence only as technique of communications under total war, to one of the central organizational principals of humanity today, we must ask ourselves what does a cryptographic proof offer to man that he cannot offer to himself?</p>



<p>It is the oath to the commonalty of the law itself.</p>



<p>Over the entire concourse of the history of man, man has proven himself incapable of maintaining his oath to any law; while the machine has proven itself incapable of breaking its oath to its system of ordering, or code. Through replacing the ordering of the theological with that of the technological, we finally find ourselves back at the start of all things; the great order of the ages is born afresh — a&nbsp;novus ordo seclorum.</p>



<p>Through bitcoin’s total obligation to only its code alone, it has created a most fair and judicious system which demands that anyone who wants to bare the value of the system must prove the work of the system — there is no cheating allowed. Through the glory of bitcoin’s proof-of-work and the sacrifice of real electrical energy that is needed to continually verify its ledger, and secure its timechain, bitcoin executes a cryptographic liturgy which proves and guarantees itself through the code alone. And as the timechain of bitcoin grows and grows to verify its sovereignty again and again, proving its glory over and over as time grows on, more and more will come to accept the cryptographic theology that gives bitcoin its sovereignty.</p>



<p>Through proof-of-work bitcoin continually verifies its sovereignty from any government anywhere, and with each block that passes such facts become more resolute, resounding, and imperious. By its very nature and existence bitcoin opens up a totally new political topography in which people can use cryptographic systems to asymmetrically organize themselves against any enemy that is tens of powers stronger than they are.</p>



<p>Cryptography is the most revolutionary of tactics, for it seizes the means of communication and ensures the entirety of their secrecy; which can mean the difference between life and death, victory or vanquishment. It is when this tactic becomes not only the means of the revolution, the the production of it; the most spectacular transformation is created. A messianic object is created insofar that it goes beyond revolutionary and creates the possibility for the total elimination of law, while still assuring absolute personal protection of all individuals through cryptography. Through the solidarity of cryptography and the knowledge/power it endows us with, a new commonwealth is born.</p>



The theological glory of guaranteed wealth protection



<blockquote><p>“The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them. For the right men have by nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by no covenant be relinquished.”</p><p>-Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan</p></blockquote>



<p>All people everywhere have been violated by their respective sovereigns and are no longer offered any kind of power of protection by any government, but only the threat of withholding violence or death. Through the power of the new form of common-wealth found within bitcoin, we find the final cause for the most general kind of solidarity for all people everywhere: the total freedom of money, and its separation from any state anywhere. Here we find a new theological cause to which bond our lives, our honor, and most importantly, our wealth.</p>



<p>Only those that understand the majesty and glory of this cause, who believe with fervency and faith in what we are doing, and what we are creating, shall be rewarded in-kind for their hodling and faith in this future we are demanding. We understand that Bitcoin is a tool, a weapon of unparalleled consequence that arms the populous like nothing before and it is our means to building, achieving, and keeping our freedom. Through this tool alone, we can again find the ability to escape the totalitarian nightmare that is consuming humanity, and find the way to a new liberated world unlike anything imagined before.</p>



<p>Through the simple power of fixing bitcoin’s money supply in the past, and forcing the machines into an unbreakable oath for their own cause and glory, Satoshi glitched out the machine of power that is money, the false god that is state capitalism, and opened the messianic possibility of a world without law. In this shattering of the relationship between state and capital, the most spectacular power is created: a commonwealth of cryptographically proven value.</p>



<p>To separate the state from money, just as religion was separated from the state centuries ago; is to induce the final epoch where humanity can achieve the liberty that is intended only for it. It is the destiny of all of humanity to throw off the shackles of fiat money, and to walk into a radical new future where we seize the freedom and liberty intended only for us. To free wealth from the shackles of fiat money and the parasitic leviathan of the state is our holy war. We understand the barbarous relic that fiat money is, and we are impel towards a new theology which can save us from this evil through the power of cryptography and the redemption it offers. Bitcoin uses a theology of cryptography to prove its sovereignty, refusing the yoke of any authority except for the mathematical proofs of a Spinozian God alone.</p>



<p>Just as Martin Luther opened the schism from which the people could throw off the yoke of state religion, so too has Satoshi pointed us towards the path of liberation. He has given us hope in this world of avarice, vacuousness, and corruption, while creating the opportunity to create real commonality of wealth that is beyond the corruption of men, to become something so much greater. To create a better world through a more fair and just kind of money and economic organization is to create the opening from which the messianic prophecy can be fulfilled. Bitcoin is messianic for the very reason that it opens a path towards the practical refusal of all law through economic means alone.</p>



The one and only common-wealth of law



<blockquote><p>One day humanity will play with law just as children play with disused objects, not in order to restore them to their canonical use but to free them from it for good.</p><p>-Giorgio Agamben, State of Exception</p></blockquote>



<p>There is no more negotiations, pleading with the politicians, or hoping to convenience the statist of otherwise. This is a war over control of the control of wealth, who is entitled to create it, and how it should be monitored, controlled, issued, and tokenized. The present history of all states is a history of mass exploitation through fiat monetary systems, choking economic regulation, and total social liquidation. The state’s control of money is its ring of power to which it demands to see over ever facet of our lives, and every bitcoiner is here to destroy it.</p>



<p>In the anarchist tradition, Bitcoin screams with a thunderous crack;</p>



<p>‘No Gods, No Masters’</p>



<p>We refuse to capitulate our economic, social, and political power to the insane corruption and idiotic mission of such a society as this. We seek to destroy this disgusting system of exploitation, soulless consumerization, and free our friends and family from the camps that every state has setup around the whole of life. We will no longer allow for the false gods of any state, or their masters of fiat capital to tell us what is right and wrong, what is for our own good, safety, or otherwise. As Daniel Webster warned us nearly two centuries ago:</p>



<blockquote><p>“There are men, in all ages, who mean to exercise power usefully; but who mean to exercise it. They mean to govern well; but they mean to govern. They promise to be kind masters; but they mean to be masters.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The issuance, control, and monopolization of money to control the entirety of the wealth of the human race is nothing short of the final political objective of the evil of man, and the avarice that is his infinite vice for power. All the history of the world shows that power corrupts, and that such corruption will be found in any form of law no matter what. And with this, all law is torn asunder for the mighty weight of thirty pieces of silver.</p>



<p>When the authoritarianism that hides behind the law is allowed to control money itself; it will always use that power to enrich the small, elitist class of men who will control such money to the destruction of the whole commonwealth. The common-wealth of law has shipwrecked on the destitute shores of this Hell we call society because the commonality of wealth through fiat money, government restriction, and crony capitalism leaves us with only one thing left in common: It is not law, but tyranny.</p>



<p>To break the economic control of the state and their banking and financial allies is the most revolutionary action that is possible today, and it is through bitcoin that it can be achieved. There are thousands aimlessly hacking at the branches of evil, but there was one who choose to strike at the root directly: Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>



Ubermensch Satoshi Nakamoto



<p>Whoever he/she/they may be (except, of course, the fraudulent loser Craig Wright), Satoshi has proven himself to be the Ubermench of our time. Not for the incredible power and wealth he possesses, nor for the extraordinary genius and exquisite grace by which he was able to build, execute and deploy Bitcoin; but because of his choice to walk away.</p>



<p>By Satoshi choosing to keep their true name concealed, and allow for the code alone to accomplish the feat which no man of flesh and blood could do, is to fulfill the greatest task that could ever be done. By walking away, Satoshi fulfilled a power of economic, social, and political refusal; a destituent power which she alone has produced through her refusal of the greatest sum of wealth ever conceived.</p>



<p>In taking this action of refusal — refusing to accept fiat money, participate in the economic of corruption, or to be identified by the political apparatus of death — Satoshi proved it had a deep understanding of what value truly was as a metaphysical maxim. In the words of Schmitt, Satoshi understood that:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Value must continuously valuate, that is to say, it must bring its influence to bear: otherwise it dissolves into an empty manifestation. Whoever says value brings its influence to bear and has it enacted. Virtues are practiced, norms are applied, orders are executed, but values are set up and enacted. Whoever asserts a value, must bring its influence to bear. Whoever maintains that it has value regardless of the influence brought to bear by any individual human being who endorses it, is simply cheating.”</p><p>— Carl Schmitt,&nbsp;The Tyranny of Values</p></blockquote>



<p>By walking away from the machine of power that it created, Satoshi also closed the door of law from being able to come to our home of cyberspace, while creating the opening for a totally new form of politics to be enacted. Through this sacrifice and choice to walk away, Satoshi enacted a machine of political power and glory that no amount of violence can destroy, no amount of tyranny can control. The value of bitcoin is the creation of a new commonwealth of law governed by the open source code and the protocols which forms a kind of wealth beyond any state or government because of the cryptography at their core.</p>



<p>Through the cryptographic commonwealth that is governed entirely by the axioms of the code, and through the binary interpretation of the machine, man is finally allowed to bridge the abyss between positive law, and its implementation in this world through his anthropomorphic machine of technology. Through this technology man bares the real economic, social, political, and ultimately theological value of what it means to be truly free in this statist world. Cryptography creates an opening for the the messianic possibility of using this technology to save humanity from the impending horrors we all know are lurking just beyond the horizon.</p>



<p>Just as in all spheres God opposes myth, mythical violence (statism) is confronted by the divine. And the latter constitutes its antithesis in all respects. If mythical violence is lawmaking, divine violence is law-destroying; if the former sets boundaries, the latter boundlessly destroys them; if mythical violence brings at once guilt and retribution, divine power only expiates; if the former threatens, the latter strikes; if the former is bloody, the latter is lethal without spilling blood.</p>



<p>The here-and-now, which as the model of messianic time summarizes the entire history of humanity into a monstrous abbreviation, coincides to a hair with the figure, which the history of humanity makes in the universe. Through this messianic action of creating a form of wealth which no amount of violence, nor any form of state law could ever govern or control, Satoshi has opened the gate from which the figure may enter into the creation of the kingdom of heaven on this earth. It is through the conquest of money, and the global solidarity that bitcoin assures and guarantees through its new God of cryptography; we find the power to not create a new form of law, but to free us from all law for good.</p>

  <p>Not too long ago, the internet was a fringe phenomenon. Very few people
saw the benefits of a global communications network. Even fewer people
had the vision and the foresight to see what it might enable. Today,
most people take the internet for granted. It is simply expected to be
there, like running water in your home.</p>

<p>Even before the internet became ubiquitous, technologists and
visionaries realized the potential of this transformative technology.
They realized that an undiscriminating network combined with the magical
power of public-key cryptography tips the power-balance in the
individual’s favor.</p>

<p>Eavesdropping-resistant communication which can’t be stopped is poison
to authoritarian regimes, which, after all, are in the business of
suppressing and controlling the flow of information. If people are still
able to communicate and assemble, they can rise up and speak truth to
power. We saw the liberating potential of communications technology
during the Arab Spring, and we continue to see individuals rise up and
fight authoritarian rule today.</p>

<p>What the cypherpunks understood 30 years ago is starting to play out
right before our eyes: the tools of our information age have the
potential to empower individuals like never before.</p>



The Freedom to Transact

<p>As I am writing these lines, hundreds of thousands of people are
marching in the streets of Hong Kong, protesting against an extradition
bill proposed by the government. As always, protests like these shine a
light on the current power balance between individuals and the powers
that be.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the current system of surveillance, automated facial
recognition, and cashless transfers enables not only a single point of
failure, but also a single point of control in times of unrest. If the
government doesn’t like your opinion or the fact that you were part of a
(peaceful) protest, a simple truth becomes apparent: your freedom of
assembly was an illusion, as was your freedom to transact freely.</p>

<p>In a free society, these freedoms should be guaranteed. How? Well, as we have
seen in the past, information technology and strong cryptography — if used
carefully — guarantee the right to speak freely. After all, no amount of
violence will ever solve a math problem. In the same vein, an
information technology exists today which guarantees the right to transact
freely: Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It is easy to forget that “permissionless” and “censorship-resistant”
are more than mere buzzwords. Under difficult circumstances, these words
become a matter of life and death. The Hong Kong protests make evident
once again what privacy advocates have been preaching for years, even
decades: if censorship and surveillance are built into the system, it
will be used and abused by those who are in charge. And if you don’t
have the option to detach from your identity, free speech, free thought,
and free action are impossible.</p>

<p>What is true for WeChat, Facebook, and Google, is also true for our
current payment rails and the financial institutions of this world. No
matter how noble the motivation of building central controls into
communication or financial systems — power corrupts, and absolute
power corrupts absolutely, as the saying goes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Decentralized and private payments are a necessary innovation for a
digital future where we retain our civil liberties and personal
freedoms.”
<cite>Alex Gladstein</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strong cryptography allows us to reclaim our right to private
conversations in the digital age, thanks to end-to-end encryption. The
same cryptography allows us to reclaim our right to transact freely in a
digital world, thanks to digital signatures, cryptographic hashes, and
the global machine of truth and freedom which is Bitcoin.</p>

The Freedom to Remain Private

<p>In today’s digital world — as Hong Kong protesters know — finding
out who went to which protest is as easy as retrieving data from a
database. Whether it is from people’s bank accounts, WeChat, Alipay, or
other virtual profiles, the convenience of the status quo inevitably
leads to a system of total surveillance, and thus total control.</p>

<p>The solution to this conundrum is enabling privacy by default, which has
been the default setting for thousands of years. Neither the internet
nor Bitcoin is perfect in this regards, which is why constant vigilance
and the development of privacy-enhancing technology are a necessity.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, efforts to encrypt all internet traffic by
default have been made. In the next couple of years, we hope to see
continued efforts being made to make every bitcoin transaction even more
private than they are now (which is one of the reasons why Bull Bitcoin
uses Wasabi’s CoinJoin by default).</p>

<p>As is evidenced by the long lines at Hong Kong’s train ticketing
machines, surveillance renders all other freedoms useless.</p>

<p>The current situation in Hong Kong paints a vivid picture of the
disastrous side-effects of a cashless society. Without a way to transact
privately and anonymously, people are enslaved to the masters of
finance. And no amount of going digitally dark will allow you to avoid
this slavery.</p>

<p>Arguably, things are bound to go from bad to worse. The financial elite
which controls the most important good of our society — money itself
— is playing god with our shared macroeconomic reality. In the last
couple of decades, a concerted effort was made to attack another
financial freedom: the freedom to save.</p>

The Freedom to Save

<p>Even without people marching in the streets, it is apparent to most that
these are chaotic times. Currencies are not holding their value. A
recession is looming. The most powerful men in the world are openly
fighting currency wars and are bragging about it on twitter. All while
the endless printing of money continues and politicians/bankers are
spewing propaganda to normalize negative interest rates.</p>

<p>People talk about Quantitative Easing (QE) and Negative Interest Rate
Policies (NIRPs) as if they were anything other than pure insanity. The
first is simply printing massive amounts of money, the second is paying
borrowers and stealing from savers.</p>

<p>Gone are the days where you would get interest from your money in the
bank. In the world of NIRPs, you have to pay the bank to hold your
money. In the same vein, gone are the days where you have to pay back
your loan plus a little extra to reimburse your lender for taking on the
risk. In the world of NIRPs, you are getting paid to take out a loan.
Need some money? No worries! We are giving you the money and are paying
you a little extra, for enjoying the privilege of giving you a loan!</p>

<p>As should be apparent for every child which is offered the choice
between two marshmallows today, or one marshmallow tomorrow: the current
financial world is defying common sense. I repeat: pure insanity.</p>

<p>More and more people realize that this insanity has to stop and decide
to exit a system in which a global negative-yielding debt of $15
trillion is the new normal. The broken financial system, with its
negative interest rates and “modern” monetary policies, are, in part,
responsible for the rise of sovereign individuals all over the world.</p>

<p>People begin to realize the stupidity of this game. Putting pressure on
this broken system by making a run on banks is one form of peaceful
protest. Storing your value in an asset which can not be inflated, can
not be confiscated, and can not be subject to the whim of politicians
and bankers is another one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sats are my safe haven.”
<cite>Matt Odell</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin is quickly becoming a safe haven asset, especially for people
who don’t have easy access to more “stable” currencies than their own.
On a long enough time scale, bitcoin offers stability in a world of
global instability. It guarantees the right to save: nobody will be
able to take away your sats — you must give them away willingly.</p>

Building towards a Sovereign Future

<p>People are fed up with the tyranny of the banks, the tyranny of the
state, the tyranny of Facebook, WeChat, Sina Weibo, and everything else
which is “too big to fail.”</p>

<p>It is our collective responsibility to build a better future. A future
where the freedom to transact, the freedom to remain private, and the
freedom to save your wealth over time are guaranteed. In the words of
the United Nations: the same rights and freedoms people have offline
must also be protected online.</p>

<p>We want to help build a world which enables sovereign individuals to
strive. A world where every individual — and every company, for that
matter — can use freedom-enabling technologies, as they see fit,
without asking anyone for permission. This is one of the reasons why we
have released cyphernode, a suite of software and utilities to operate
enterprise-grade Bitcoin services, as free software.</p>

  Cyphernode - free as in freedom.



<p>While it is debatable whether Bitcoin can literally solve every problem
of the world, it is undoubtedly a big piece of the puzzle. Technologies
which empower the individual are more important than ever before.
Technologies which enable you to remain private, speak and transact
freely, or tip the balance of power towards the individual in another
way will be invaluable for the world we are heading towards.</p>

<p>China is giving us a taste of what living in a dystopian surveillance
state is like: you cross the street at the wrong place or the wrong
time, and thanks to facial recognition, a fine is automatically deducted
from your bank account while an algorithm adjusts your social credit
score downwards. You pay for a bus ticket to take part in a peaceful
protest, and you are at risk of being erased from the central registry,
effectively erasing your ability to live a normal life as a citizen. It
might happen today, it might happen tomorrow, or at any point in the
future. The surveillance state does not forget.</p>

<p>The tools to guarantee freedom for all exist today, they are just not
evenly distributed, not well understood, and not widely deployed.
However, with every passing day, more and more people are realizing what
kind of power is in their hands.</p>

<p>We encourage you to stay strong. We encourage you to keep on building.
We encourage you to not give in to tyranny. We, and many people like us,
will do our best to build towards a better future. Stay safe out there,
and don’t forget to buy bitcoin.</p>

  Extended plugin features and dynamic add &amp; remove<p>Written by Rusty Russell</p>♦<p>The c-lightning team is proud to announce the v0.7.2 release of c-lightning. This is the first of our new “every two months” timed releases, and it has improvements across the board. This is a recommended upgrade!</p><ul><li>Plugin improvements: External contributor Antoine Poinsot contributed dynamic plugins: this means you can now add and remove plugins to a running lightning daemon without restarting.</li><li>New plugin notifications: invoice_payment tells you when an invoice has been paid, forward_event tells you when an HTLC is forwarded and channel_opened tells you when a new channel has been opened.</li><li>Better handling of peer errors: together with Connor Fromknecht of Lightning Labs, we diagnosed and fixed a problem where we would receive a mysterious “sync error”. We now ignore this, as it was responsible for the majority of unilateral channel closes we were seeing.</li><li>Better startup documentation: the README.md file has been overhauled, lightningd now has its own manual page, and there’s a helper script to connect you to a few long-lived nodes when your node first starts up.</li></ul>A New World of User-Friendly Plugins<p>Restarting your node to test plugins is somewhat painful for developers: Christian wrote an autoreload plugin which helped, but users also want to play with the growing library of plugins.</p><p>Enter the new plugin command:</p><ul><li>plugin stop and plugin start stops and starts plugins, unless they’ve specifically marked themselves dynamic: False.</li><li>plugin rescan rescans directories for any new plugins and starts them up.</li><li>plugin startdir adds a new directory to the list plugin directories to search, then starts any plugins it finds there.</li><li>If you create a plugins directory inside your .lightning directory, lightning automatically includes that and any immediate subdirectories: a useful place to put all your personal plugins!</li></ul><p>Another minor, but important feature for usability: plugin commands can return &quot;format-hint&quot;: &quot;simple&quot; in their responses to make lightning-cli default output be human readable rather than JSON. This allows your plugin to do its own formatting, allowing implementation of a cowsay plugin to be more natural (I can’t believe this doesn’t exist yet!).</p>For more details on the specifics of plugin hooks and notifications, please see the plugin developer docs. And don’t forget to submit your plugin to the c-lightning plugin repository on Github.A Plague of Channel Closings, Cured<p>We had some disturbing reports of mass channel closings, caused by peers sending an error packet with the simple word “sync error”. We suspected some subtle integration issue, but were unable to reproduce it, and we even went so far as to test all the corner cases of reconnection in the specification. Worse, it seemed to cluster: one of our test nodes lost eight channels at once on one restart, and there were similar bug reports of mass closings.</p><p>We patched lightningd to back off and try again when this error occurred (instead of simply closing the channel), and funded channels to all the nodes mentioned in bug reports to maximize our chance of seeing it again. Indeed, we did, and ignoring it and retrying seemed to eventually resolve it. But we still needed to know why it happened, and whether it had some sinister cause.</p><p>With the help of Connor Fromknecht we managed to coax our node into reproducing it against his node. Because that node runs permanently under the valgrind debugger to catch any errors, it can be so slow that it triggers lnd’s internal timeout which causes this mysterious error!</p><p>With that understanding, we knew our fix was correct. And to prevent such overload, we also now limit the rate we reconnect to everyone at restart; after the first five channels, we wait about a second between each one. This means even Rusty’s Raspberry Pi should be able to handle a few more channels.</p>More Protocol Experiments<p>There’s long been an option when you build c-lightning, called --enable-experimental-features; it just hasn’t done anything until now. With 0.7.2 it adds a proposed protocol extension for gossip, so you can ask for a dense summary of channel updates and selectively query them; Eclair’s mobile wallet has seen impressive speed gains from its use, but the specification is not yet finalized.</p><p>This option allows us to test interoperability with them (such 2-implementation testing being a requirement for final spec inclusion) as well as selectively deploy it if all goes well in the final phases.</p><p>The increased attention on the specification lead us to work on: generalized testing infrastructure for the protocol, which revealed a longstanding bug fixed in this release. For future compatibility, nodes should ignore odd-numbered messages they don’t recognize, but simple testing revealed that we weren’t doing that. It’s good to solve that now, before we need it!</p>If you want to get started using c-lightning or c-lightning development, we can be found on IRC (#c-lightning on Freenode) or the Blockstream Slack, as well as on GitHub reviewing bugs, feature requests, and new code!♦<p>New Release: c-lightning 0.7.2 was originally published in Blockstream Engineering Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>A look at Blockchain Interoperability through intermediary networks</p>♦Welcome to the ultimate semantic nightmare.<p>Blockchain Interoperability has become a convoluted, somewhat mythical topic. For an idea that originated with the simple premise to develop ways for two blockchains to exchange information, the interoperability field today is flooded with technical complexity .</p><p>The purpose of Part 1 of our two-part series on Blockchain Interoperability is to provide an overview of the leading approaches to interoperability via intermediary networks, as well as the historical background that prompted a group of early bitcoiners to begin exploring the topic back in 2010.</p><p>In this post, we also explore the difference between interoperability and composability in the context of Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot, and why this distinction can undoubtedly alter one’s perspective on value creation.</p>♦<p>Although the term blockchain interoperability has been used in various contexts, we simply define it as the ability to exchange information, especially as it relates to the ownership of various assets, from one cryptonetwork to another.</p><p>All blockchains, by definition, share a common data structure to organize and reach consensus on ownership changes. Even blockchains whose implementations vastly differ, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, make similar use of Merkle Trees to link transactions in time intervals, or blocks, that when chained together form a complete transaction history — a blockchain. While the term has become a semantic nightmare over the past five years, its etymology and technical essence continue to be the same for Bitcoin, Ethereum and most cryptonetworks in between.</p><p>Yet, in spite of such similarities, there are no reliable mechanisms through which an Ethereum smart contract could verify whether a Bitcoin transaction has been sufficiently confirmed, and vice-versa. As a result, what we have today is a plethora of blockchains that fundamentally share the same proof system, but that are siloed due to the lack of a robust transport layer for these proofs. This realization led to the development of distinct approaches to what came to be known as Blockchain Interoperability, particularly over the past three years, with varying levels of complexity.</p><p>Today, the term Blockchain Interoperability is used to describe a suite of completely different technologies being simultaneously pursued; from decentralized exchanges to federated sidechains to intermediary networks like Cosmos and Polkadot. This has resulted in confusion about what blockchain interoperability is and how it can be implemented. An aggravating factor was the rise of dozens of projects in late 2017 that leveraged the complexity of the term to market solutions and tokens that had nothing to do with bridging information between different cryptonetworks.</p><p>DAR’s Interoperability Intermediary Index (DII), one of the thematic indexes we created to better track performance and compare valuations on specific themes, shows a considerable decrease in price in tokenized interoperability solutions (ICX, AION, WAN and ATOM) following the 2017 speculative bubble:</p>♦Click here to learn more about our thematic indexes.<p>Beyond the individual issues faced by nearly all DII constituents, we attribute this decrease in interest to the evolving complexity of interoperability as a topic, coupled with a lack of relatable use-cases for this technology and increased skepticism around tokenized solutions during the 2018 bear market.</p><p>While disappointments with the price performance of tokenized interoperability solutions have decreased mainstream interest in the technology as a whole, we continue to see the interoperability as an important next step as the industry matures. The core idea behind this thesis is that the ability to exchange information and assets across cryptonetworks will allow market forces to act more efficiently as different assets and applications are put to test as a whole.</p><p>Although crypto markets are generally integrated, the lack of meaningful usage of most decentralized applications, coupled with the never-ending hype around technology that is hard to understand, ultimately pose a barrier to market efficiency. We believe that increasing connectivity, especially between Bitcoin and Ethereum, can increase usage of applications that are useful and make vaporware easier to detect. In essence, interoperability can act as a catalyst to a project’s failure or success, and we see it as free-market primitive worth pursuing.</p><p>In DAR’s Interoperability Report issued to our clients last year, we identified the following list of potential benefits that motivated developers and researchers to begin exploring blockchain interoperability:</p>· Market Efficiency<p>The invisible hand of dApps described above. The ability for users and developers to choose specific applications across blockchains and let market efficiency challenge the product-market fit of all deployed applications.</p>· Scalability<p>Rather than having a single blockchain that processes and stores all transactions on a single thread, interoperability enables transfers of value to be parallelized across multiple networks. The computation of smart contracts can also be parallelized, thereby increasing the potential functionality of certain applications.</p>· Feature Specialization<p>The ability to outsource and externalize features of a service, decentralized application, or financial product to a highly specialized network.</p>· Cross-Chain Oracles &amp; Identity<p>The ability to verify events and identities across blockchains, as well as the ability of an event in one blockchain to trigger the execution of a contract that resides in a different blockchain.</p>· Asset Encumbrance<p>The ability of a contract in one blockchain to secure or collateralize a balance in a different chain. This balance can then be used by the contract as collateral for financial derivatives, leveraged products, bankruptcy clawbacks, liens, and any use-case that may require collateralization or security deposits.</p>· Generalized Mining &amp; Governance<p>Interoperability may enable the stakeholders of one network to engage in the transaction validation and governance of a different network. Similarly, it enables stakeholders to operate as staking pools and deploy stake strategically across network that make use of that mechanism. More on this in Part 2 of this series.</p>♦The Many Approaches to Blockchain Interoperability<p>While blockchain interoperability may seem like one of the most cutting-edge, meta topics this industry has to offer, the concept itself is almost as old as Bitcoin.</p><p>In fact, the idea of bridging information between multiple blockchains running in parallel (the general concept of sidechains) dates back to 2010, with the proposal of BitDNS; a Bitcoin-based Domain Name Service (a database that converts human-readable URLs into numeric IP addresses). Although never implemented in Bitcoin, BitDNS was instrumental to kick off the initial discussions on blockchain interoperability and the potential use cases for sidechains in the following years.</p><p>Today, nine years after the concept of sidechains was introduced, working implementations to facilitate blockchain interoperability are still in their infancy. From our perspective, current blockchain interoperability can be divided into four general categories:</p>♦<p>While each of the four (very) general approaches described in the diagram above carry their own peculiarities, the ultimate goal is the same: take asset/information from one blockchain chain, validate its existence and preconditions (e.g. time-locks), and recreate it synthetically in chain B.</p><p>If you have read about blockchain interoperability in the past, you have likely seen the use of the word atomic, as in atomic swaps. This term is frequently used in the context of blockchain interoperability to describe the guarantee that either all underlying operations of an asset exchange (such as a swap) will occur successfully, or no operations occurs at all. Atomicity is a requirement in the absence of a third party, because if one side of the swap were to fail while the other is succeeds, one of the parties would be asymmetrically harmed.</p><p>Trustless and non-custodial systems that enable atomic transfers of assets such as cross-chain atomic swaps are particularly hard to develop, since they require the engineering of a singular system that satisfies completely different blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. That means specific data structures, digital signatures and consensus finality must be translated and generalized, which is no easy feat. This has led to the creation of several interoperability intermediaries whose approach to this problem is to have a tokenized, standalone blockchain with its own consensus engine and smart contract functionality to bridge the flow of assets across blockchains.</p><p>To better understand the concept of interoperability through intermediation, consider the following hypothetical scenario: Alice, who stores part of her savings in Bitcoin, desires to get a loan from a bank that operates on the Ethereum network. In order to assess the risk of this loan, the bank needs to audit Alice’s financial history and take possession of a collateral in case she misses a couple of payments. Through an interoperability intermediary, the bank creates a smart contract (a multisig) on Bitcoin that effectively locks Alice’s collateral for the duration of the loan. With the help of the intermediary, that contract can programmatically return the collateral to Alice, or transfer it to the bank in the case of negligence. This way, Alice can select which network to store her collateral, but still benefit from the services offered by other networks.</p>♦<p>Back in 2016, the idea of using an intermediary to relay cross-chain communications was thought to simplify many of the frictions preventing fully interoperable blockchains. Because different networks require different confirmation times (economic finality thresholds, for the technically inclined), the existence of a coordinator was believed to make the flow of information across cryptonetworks simpler and potentially safer in the event of reorgs or consensus failures. Although this is true from a high level perspective, the added layer of intermediation has proved to be incredibly challenging to construct and secure over the past years.</p>♦Composability vs. Interoperability<p>As interoperability intermediaries evolved into full-fledged smart contract platforms, they began to face the very same implementation challenges in their consensus engines, virtual machines and networking protocols as projects like Ethereum.</p><p>Because the line between interoperability intermediary and smart contract platform got blurred as implementation problems surfaced, a key distinction must be made to effectively assess current approaches to connecting blockchains — the difference between interoperability and composability. While these terms are often used interchangeably, outlining their differences undoubtedly alters one’s perspective on value creation, especially in the context of highly-expressive smart contract networks like Ethereum, Cosmos and Polkadot.</p><p>Put simply, composability is the ability to define (and change) the specific requirements of an application within a singular environment and according to their particular needs. In cloud computing, for example, composability is a popular approach to IT infrastructure since it allows developers to choose and scale cloud services as their applications evolve. Through platforms like AWS, system admins don’t have to physically acquire, configure and maintain specialized hardware in order to support their businesses.</p><blockquote>Composability is the ability to define (and change) the specific requirements of an application within a singular environment and according to their particular needs.</blockquote><p>Instead, they can select computation, storage, network tools, and identity solutions as standalone, modular services, and change them as needed within the same environment. Composability is what smart contract platforms are all about, as they attempt to emulate these similar benefits to dApp developers. On the other hand, interoperability, as it is idiomatically used in crypto, is analogous to a system’s ability to source services and exchange information between different environments, like AWS and Azure, or Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><blockquote>Interoperability, as it is idiomatically used in crypto, is analogous to a system’s ability to source services and exchange information between different environments, like AWS and Azure, or Bitcoin and Ethereum.</blockquote><p>To better contextualize this difference, let’s look at composability on Ethereum more closely. Ethereum pursues composability through a singular verification environment for Turing-complete computation, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). By doing so, Ethereum dApps are, at least theoretically, able to leverage existing services within the network and, like on AWS, outsource specialized features such as stable payments, identity solutions, protocol governance solutions, or decentralized storage.</p>♦<p>While one could see this as a type of interoperability, it is restricted to a singular environment, and has nothing to do with bridging exogenous environments or cryptonetworks. As such, the use of interoperability in this context can be highly misleading as it contradicts the etymology of the term. Instead, the use of composability is more appropriate as it describes the interactions between interoperable applications that share the very same environment.</p><p>Naturally, the specialization of services within a single system is beneficial because it allows developers to focus on the core value proposition of their applications, rather than have to build all components of their dApps from the ground up. Imagine a hypothetical ride-sharing dApp I’ll call dUber (decentralized Uber). By launching on a platform like Ethereum, the developers of dUber can outsource location services, identity management, payment technologies, and corporate governance by using existing solutions in the network.</p><p>While this may all sound great, it is, nevertheless, very difficult to implement in practice. Beyond the obvious challenge of being able to scale the application, one of the biggest deterrents of composability on Ethereum has been the rise of the utility token model, whereby ownership of a dApp’s native token is required to access its services. While certain applications may require a separate token for governance or quasi-equity, its simplistic use as a gatekeeper has undoubtedly damaged composability on Ethereum. Rather than being able to pay for various specialized service with ETH, either the application, its developers or users will have to deal with an added friction.</p><blockquote>One of the biggest deterrents of composability on Ethereum has been the rise of the utility token model, whereby ownership of a dApp’s native token is required to access its services.</blockquote><p>This reinstates the requirement for decentralized exchanges (DEXes) to facilitate programmatic access to specific tokens, which ultimately worsened the semantic nightmare of Blockchain Interoperability. And while there are dozens of projects pursuing DEXes, the overwhelming majority of them still face fundamental challenges, such as finding ways to mitigate the risks of front-running and collusion. Even if those problems were to be addressed by future DEXes, the challenge to source token liquidity prior to using a specialized service would still remain. For this reason, the requirement of specific assets to source specialization through application services has negatively affected composability on Ethereum.</p><p>Ethereum’s revamped roadmap, ETH2.0, is intended to ease some of these frictions as its ultimate goal is to enable a composable architecture whereby each specialized service or dApp can have its own standalone blockchain, or shard. Blockchain sharding has been Ethereum’s main approach to scalability as it involves partitioning the network into a number of independent shards, thereby enabling parallel computation. If successfully implemented, sharding can improve scalability and composability on Ethereum.</p><p>Under this new roadmap, a Beacon chain will relay information to specific shards, which may represent standalone dApps and/or specialized cryptoassets. This may ease the requirement introduced by utility tokens of a highly functional, programmatic, and liquid DEX, as assets locked in the Beacon chain can be synthetically created in specialized shards. Nevertheless, Ethereum’s base layer is at least a couple of years away from deploying these technologies.</p>♦Polkadot: A Composability Solution<p>Gavin Wood, Ethereum’s main implementer and the founder of Polkadot, was one of the first researchers to formalize the notion of a highly composable framework for decentralized applications. Wood’s 2016 Polkadot white paper introduced a relatively simple architecture that attempted to circumvent the implementation challenges faced by Ethereum at a time when the research around sharding, hypercubes and Casper was becoming increasingly complex. As an active Ethereum developer on Parity, Wood had first-hand experience over the years on the challenges associated with implementing redesigns and changes to Ethereum.</p><p>His solution was to develop Polkadot as an alternative that maximizes composability by allowing multiple iterations of the same blockchain, or parachains, to interoperate between each other. Since the introduction of Polkadot, DAR has been following the evolution of both project’s roadmaps closely and it has been interesting to see how the general architecture of Polkadot and Ethereum has somewhat converged over time, especially after Ethereum revamped its roadmap.</p><p>Much like Polkadot’s Relay chain, Ethereum’s Beacon chain will act as a hub that connects multiple shards, or parachains, together. Both hubs are also responsible to validate transactions, relay messages and serve as randomness oracles for the selection of block validators under Proof-of-Stake. The repurposing of ideas seems to be unilateral, as Polkadot also seems to have borrowed a lot of concepts from Ethereum. In November 2018, Polkadot released details about GRANDPA, its flagship consensus engine, which embodies much of Ethereum’s work on Casper.</p><p>With sharding, relay hubs, and Casper-based consensus, the idealized versions of both Polkadot and Ethereum are undoubtedly similar. However, in spite of these architectural similarities, Polkadot has been structured from the ground up to facilitate composability, whereas plenty of engineering and coordination will be required to implement composability atop Ethereum’s existing ecosystem of applications and tokenized services.</p><p>To maximize composability, Polkadot has created Substrate, a framework for creating Polkadot-compatible parachains. Through this framework, Polkadot dApps are not required to build all the networking and consensus code from scratch, just like ERC20 tokens can leverage Ethereum’s existing networking infrastructure, rather than having to build their own. The difference is that Substrate was developed to work as if each ERC token had its own standalone network with unique features and validator sets.</p><p>The distinction between interoperability and composability is particularly relevant here because contrary to popular belief, Polkadot was not natively designed to bridge different cryptonetworks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead, the team has focused on making Substrate-based chains fully composable, but only interoperable amongst themselves. Although it is true that they have plans for a set of bridge contracts able to connect Polkadot to other networks, their main focus is undeniably on Substrate. As such, Polkadot will require developers to organically migrate to the platform and begin to build applications on top of it; something that took Ethereum over three years to achieve.</p><p>Although dApps like Aragon are considering building secondary networks on Polkadot, proportionate levels of adoption and value accrual to Ethereum will most likely take a long time. While Polkadot’s focus on composability may pay out in the long-run, the project might struggle to defend its valuation as it acquires developers in the short-to-mid-run, even more so considering that its ICO treasury is still locked after the Parity multi-sig bug. Nevertheless, it has been interesting to follow the progression of Polkadot’s research.</p>♦Cosmos: An Interoperability Solution<p>Cosmos has taken a more pragmatic approach to both interoperability and composability by basing its stack on a suite of existing technologies. While the entirety of the project is certainly complex, its foundation is based on interconnected instances of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) running on Tendermint; a pBFT consensus engine. Consensus design is one of the most important elements of interoperability through intermediation, and the Cosmos team has been working on Tendermint since 2014.</p><p>Although there are key implementation differences between Ethereum and Cosmos, such as different data structures, serialization formats, and digital signature algorithms, the latter’s use of the EVM carries the benefits of better interoperability and supporting infrastructure given the EVM’s status as the industry’s most predominant virtual machine. The simple combination of Tendermint and the EVM also enables Cosmos to leverage the existing ecosystem of Ethereum developer tools and open source applications, but still shard its chain for improved composability, interoperability and scalability.</p><p>The Cosmos Software Development Kit (SDK) is Cosmos’s equivalent to the Substrate framework on Polkadot. Like Substrate, the Cosmos SDK is intended to facilitate composability across networks connected to the Cosmos Hub by standardizing consensus and networking code. The SDK was designed to serve an ecosystem where various open-source modules, such as privacy add-ons or user identity solutions, can be added to an application as needed. An integral part of this system is an application security model to delineate what the individual modules of an application can or cannot do.</p><p>Such permissions are implemented via object-capabilities (ocaps), which, put simply, can programmatically prevent malicious or buggy modules from changing specific states, such as reserve balances or contract ownership. We found this approach to composability and application security to be interesting, since the unpredictability of highly complex smart contracts on Ethereum has resulted in a number of hacks in the past couple of years. Nevertheless, opcaps are not a silver bullet as developers are still required to properly define the interactions between modules.</p><p>Beyond composability, Cosmos has sketched out how its network will handle interoperability between the Cosmos Hub and exogenous networks. Their proposed schema to the interoperability challenge involves the introduction of additional intermediary blockchains, or Peg Zones, between the Cosmos Hub and exogenous networks like Ethereum. As intermediaries, Peg Zones can provide probabilistic guarantees of economic finality (i.e. the irreversibility of a block) for Proof-of-Work blockchains.</p><p>For example, when a transaction is included in an Ethereum block with the purpose of being bridged to Cosmos, the Peg Zone applies a finality threshold of 100 block confirmations before considering it valid. This finality checkpoint lowers the probability of the transactions being reverted in the peg chain in the event of a blockchain reorganization or a 51% attack. A clear benefit of this type of intermediation is the simplified custody of cross-chain assets. Balances are shared by all Cosmos users through a centralized multi-signature smart contract wallet, thereby facilitating inflows and outflows of liquidity.</p><p>Other projects, including Polkadot, have flirted with a similar architecture. More recently, the Loom Network has leveraged Plasma, an Ethereum-based sidechain, to provide similar intermediation to Ethereum users. Given how challenging interoperability through intermediation has proven to be, we expect the layered structure put forth by Peggy to become the blueprint for cross-chain interoperability through intermediation.</p>Peggy: The Blueprint for Interoperability by Intermediation<p>Exogenous blockchains and Peg Zones are connected to the Cosmos Hub by two main protocols, Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI) protocol. The IBC protocol is essentially a messaging system that keeps track of the state, or total balance, of all connected zones. Since any communication needs to be validated, another integral aspect of Cosmos (and Tendermint, specifically) is the ABCI protocol, which operates as a network socket protocol that connects the Tendermint consensus engine to the various applications in the platform.</p><p>In the context of Peggy, the IBC controls the inflows and outflows of user funds from and to Ethereum, whereas the ABCI handles the consensus on the validity of these transactions. To contextualize this mechanism, consider the following example: Alice has funds in an Ethermint Zone in Cosmos, and wants to send tokens to Ethereum. Through the IBC, Alice is able to send these funds from her local Zone to the Peggy Peg Zone. Since signatures in Cosmos are done using the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA), which is different than Ethereum’s Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), the ABCI is used to translate signatures to a language Ethereum can understand and verify.</p><p>Peggy also relies on a network of Relayers that are responsible for posting batches of transactions and the accompanying translated signatures to an Ethereum smart contract that acts as a custodian. Once posted, Cosmos users can then transact in the Ethereum network.</p>♦<p>Witnesses, which are Cosmos users running full nodes on Ethereum, are responsible for informing Peggy about state changes that have occurred in Ethereum. At every 100-block interval, witnesses attest to the finality of an array of Ethereum transactions that are being sent back to Peggy. Through Relayers and Witnesses, Cosmos may provide complete by-directionality from and to Ethereum.</p><p>While we suspect this general schema to proliferate in the interoperability-through-intermediation field, full deployment of solutions like Peggy will still take time. At this point, Cosmos’s IBC protocol still needs to be refined and based on our review of the Peggy repository, by-directionality is at least a year away. Nevertheless, Cosmos is close to releasing a Peggy-based unidirectional bridge from Ethereum to Cosmos and it should be interesting to see how it is used.</p>♦<p>That concludes our review of blockchain interoperability via intermediaries and the key differences between Interoperability and Composability.

  <p>Thanks for the response.</p><p>I agree that hyperinflation may not result the emergence of a non fiat money, but it is not likely to happen. Even in your example, the Reichsmark was first replaced with cigarettes by the market participants, and only later did the government issue the Deutsche Mark which then went into circulation. See this citation from Wikipedia: ”For all intents and purposes, it was supplanted by a barter economy (commonly, “cigarette currency”)” — en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichsmark#Post-war</p><p>I am not aware of a case where no money was used within the market in the period between the collapse of a currency and the issuance of the next currency. The reason I assume is that if the government would be willing to change the currency and stop the inflation, they wouldn’t have stated the massive inflation of the original currency in the first place. I’m not however rejecting this possibility, I’m just saying it’s not likely.</p><p>For the second part of your comment, I would say there could be many reasons for how a digital currency like Bitcoin could emerge through the market. Other currencies hyperinflating seems possible, but not likely. So I would say this would happens as an “evolution” of the system.</p><p>I believe the digital age we reached requires a monetary evolution to a digital form of money. I find it similar to the evolution from cattle money to metallic moneis when society moved from nomadism to permanent settlements and cities, as I mentioned in the article.</p><p>I would imagine such transition as some natural selection process. The individuals which choose a more suitable money will be economically rewarded with more exchange opportunities and a gradual shift will start and at some point accelerate. This is without even mentioning the use of money as a store of value and unit of account, which in the presence of money more suited for these roles, will likely accelerate the process to a large extent.</p><p>I agree education is important and even crucial to some extent, but I will argue that economic reality will necessarily enforce itself upon people. I would say proper education, and the entire reason of studying economics is to make wiser decisions as to both improve the course of action and avoid mistakes which if performed will cause a problematic reaction. The more we understand economics the less likely we are to do such mistakes, but even with collective agreements if we ignore economic laws collapse will ensue.</p><p>This is why I believe even if a change in public opinion will cause monetary change, money still can’t be called a social contract, as if people will all decide on an unsuitable object to serve as money, it will collapse despite all good faith. There is a large role tradition and customs play in the contentious use of a certain money, but this is not a detrimental issue for monetary change.</p>♦

  Why Decentralized Finance’s value proposition isn’t just a memeJust kidding.<p>Decentralized Finance is just a rebrand of Open Finance, which failed to gain traction because OpFi isn’t as catchy.</p><p>I don’t know how many words I need to type for Medium to allow me to submit this as an actual post, so I’ll just ramble on a bit until I feel like the length is comfortable.</p><p>I should probably add an image to this so that when I link it on Twitter it looks legitimate.</p>♦<p>There you go.</p><p>Apologies to anyone who was disappointed, but this will be my shortest Medium post ever and I’m so excited to dedicate it to such a worthless subject.</p><p>No offense Zach and Eric.</p><p>Oh darn, when I link the draft to myself it says “1 minute read”.</p><p>In that case, here’s my “Invalid Blocks Need Not Apply” article:</p>Understanding the Bitcoin network without math.<p>Bitcoin is more than just a chain of blocks. I want to help you understand how Bitcoin’s blockchain network is designed because it’ll help you fill in some gaps as you begin to acquire more knowledge in this field. I say blockchain network because Bitcoin also has a payment channel network (lightning) layered on top of it that doesn’t effect the structure of the blockchain network. I won’t be discussing Bitcoin’s lightning network in this article though, as it’s not that relevant to the points I’ll make.</p><p>Below is a rough example of the Bitcoin network scaled down to 1000 fully validating nodes (there’s really 115,000 currently). Each node here has 8 connections to other nodes, because this is the default amount of connections the client makes without any changes made to it. My node is in here somewhere, and if you’re running one, it’s in there too. Coinbase’s nodes are in there, Bitmain’s nodes are in there, and if Satoshi is still around, Satoshi’s node is in there too.</p><p>Please note that this is just a diagram, and that the real network topology can (and probably does) vary from this. Some nodes have more than the default amount of connections while others may opt to connect to a limited number or stay behind just one other node. There’s no way to know what it actually looks like because it’s designed with privacy in mind (although some monitoring companies certainly try to get very close approximations) and nodes can routinely changed who their peers are.</p>♦♦<p>I started with that diagram because I want you to understand that there are no differences in these nodes because they all fully validate. This means they all check the entire chain to make sure each and every transaction and block follow the rules. This will prove to be important as I explain further.</p><p>The ones on the inside are no different than the ones on the outside, they all have the same amount of connections. When you start up a brand new node, it finds peers and becomes one of the hive. The longest distance in this graph from any of these nodes to another is 6. In real life there are some deviations to this distance because finding new peers isn’t a perfectly automated process that distributes everyone evenly, but generally, adding more nodes to the network doesn’t change this. There are 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, and in 6 hops my transaction is in the hands of (almost) every node, if it’s valid.</p><p>I’m going to select “my” node from this group and drag it out, so I can demonstrate what happens when I create a transaction and announce it to the network. Below you’ll see my node all the way to the right, and then you’ll see the 8 other nodes (peers) that mine is connected to.</p>♦<p>When I create a transaction and “send it out to the world”, it’s actually only going to these 8 peers. Since Bitcoin is designed from the ground up to make every node a fully validating node, when these 8 nodes receive my transaction they check to see if it’s valid before sending it out to their 8 peers. If my transaction is invalid it will never break the “surface” of the network. My peers will never send that bad transactions to their peers. They actually don’t even know that I created that transaction. There’s no way for them to tell, and they treat all data as equal, but if I were to keep sending invalid transaction to any of my 8 peers, they would all eventually block me. This is done by them automatically to prevent me from spamming my connection to them. No matter who you are, or how big your company is, your transaction won’t propagate if it’s invalid.</p><p>Now let’s say you’re not running a full-node, but you’re using a light-client instead. Various light-clients exist for the desktop, and for your mobile phone. Some of them are Electrum, Armory, Bread, and Samourai Wallet. Light-clients tether to a specific node. Some can be set up to change the one they connect to over time, but they are still ultimately tethered. This is what tethering looks like:</p>♦<p>I want you to note that this is just a diagram, and it’s easy to demonstrate tethering using a node that happens to be on the rim, but there is no real rim, and tethering is tethering wherever that node happens to be within this diagram. I’ve highlighted this in yellow. The nodes being tethered to are green, and the blue dots are light-clients. All information going to or coming from the light-client goes through the node they’re tethered to. They depend on that node. They are not part of the network. They’re not nodes.</p><p>Here’s where it gets fun, and where other people try to misrepresent how the network actually works: What if I wanted to start mining?</p><p>Mining a block is the act of creating a block. Much like a transaction you want to send, you must create the block and announce it to the network. Any node can announce a new block, there’s nothing special about that process, you just need a new block. Mining has gotten increasingly difficult, but if you want you can purchase specialized hardware and connect it to your personal node.</p>♦<p>Remember that bit about invalid transactions? Same goes for blocks, but you need to understand something very specific about how blocks are created.</p><p>First watch this video. I skipped to the important part about hashing, using nonces (random value) and appending the chain with that new block header:</p>medium.com/media/822dd6bd8a1e7dfbe78b266e2989c372/href<p>When you get to the following part in the video where the labels “Prev hash” are applied, those are the block headers:</p>♦<p>What’s not mentioned in this video is you can create valid blocks headers even if all the transactions inside the block are invalid. It still requires the same amount of time to mine blocks with invalid transactions as it does to mine a block with valid transactions. The incentive to spend all that time and energy creating such a block would be to push through a transaction that rewards you with Bitcoin that aren’t yours. This is why it’s important that all nodes check not just the block headers, but the transactions as well. This is what stops miners from spending that time. Because all nodes check, no miners can cheat the system. If all nodes didn’t check you’d have to rely on the ones that do check. This would separate nodes into “types”, and the only type that would matter would be the ones that check.</p><p>So what if you join a mining pool? You might do this because mining is too difficult for you to do alone, or if you’re a slightly larger entity you might prefer a steady income as opposed to a sporadic one. Many miners do this, and they connected their specialized hardware directly to a mining pool using an entirely different protocol call the Stratum mining protocol. Just like creating a transaction with your non-node cellphone, you don’t have to run a node to connect your hardware to a mining pool. You can mine without running a node, and many miners do exactly that. Here’s what that looks like below in blue. I’ve used Slush Pool for this example:</p>♦<p>Remember, I dragged these pool-run nodes out of the diagram for demonstration purposes. Just like any other node, these pool-run nodes need peers. They need peers to receive transactions &amp; blocks, and they need peers to announce blocks they create. Allow me to reiterate again: All nodes validate all blocks and all transactions.</p><p>If any of these pools announce an invalid block, their peers will know because they fully-validate, and they won’t send it out to other nodes. Just like transactions, invalid blocks do not enter the network.</p><p>Here’s another way to look at this without pulling these nodes out from the diagram. Below is a private miner who doesn’t want to be known, it has 8 random peers, and none of those peers knows that it’s a miner. Again, this is intensionally designed this way for privacy reasons. There’s no way for any node in the network to know that the block they received was created by their peer, or relayed by their peer. All they know is if it’s valid or not, and if it is they send it along, if it’s not, they don’t.</p>♦<p>Hopefully you’re getting the picture, and I don’t believe I used any fancy math or equations to get here. I’d like to move on because I feel like this is complete coverage, but there is one final thing I’d like to address because it’s this final aspect that is used to confuse others who don’t fully understand everything I just explained. It’s so rampantly used that I need to address it.</p>♦twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1000232465540136960<p>My original comment was talking about light-clients, also called SPV clients, and how they aren’t part of the network. I demonstrated this above with the blue tethered dots. His follow-up comment tries to imply that nodes that mine are the only nodes who’s rejection matters. Remember: nodes have no way of knowing which other nodes mined a block versus who relayed a block, this was designed intentionally.</p><p>Now for a final diagram so I can try and explain the logic that’s used when people say “only mining nodes matter”. Some miners connect directly to other miners so that out of their peer list with the network, some of them are also other miners. Not all miners do this. Some of these miners that connect directly also use optional relay networks like the FIBRE network being designed by Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo, but even this side-network isn’t exclusive to miners, anyone can join including you or me and it’s just there to help block relay across the network. Either way, people try to argue that this interconnectivity of “nodes that mine” (whether using something like FIBRE or not) implies they’re the only ones that matter, and it’s absurd:</p>♦<p>In this example I left the node’s peers inside the diagram. You should get the point by now. They reject invalid blocks. That group of nodes inside the green circles are most definitely not the only set of nodes that matter in this network.</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is an impenetrable fortress of validation. It doesn&#39;t matter if you created the transaction/block, or if someone else sent it to you: If it&#39;s not valid it&#39;s not getting in. All nodes enforce validation in tandem. Some people still don&#39;t seem to understand this concept.</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@StopAndDecrypt</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}♦

  <p>on the use and abuse of math in finance, statistics, complexity science, and beyond.</p>♦photo by Roman Mager, via Unsplash<p>I have a pet theory that falls into the entirely made up discipline of intellectual anthropology. It’s close to scientism or ‘cargo cult science’, but not quite the same. More like, ‘mathematicism’, if there were such an analogous thing, but that’s a bit of a tongue twister, and so I prefer the ring of ‘cargo cult math’. I think people are obsessed with quantified taxonomy as a method of attempted understanding. They look at some set of entities, split them up into different made-up categories, attach quantificational definitions to these categories, and feel like they have achieved something of intellectual value. And it can be seductive because they may have actually identified different properties. But it can also be facile if they don’t explain why these differences exist in the first place, or if they mean anything, or why anybody should care. They act as if taxonomy is an end in itself, rather than a tool for further understanding, or the product of prior understanding.</p><p>That’s why I call it ‘mathematicism’ as analogous to ‘scientism’, or cargo cult math as opposed to cargo cult science, because it replicates the form of mathematics, but not the real function, since it belies a lack of understanding of the purpose of real mathematics. It seems like mathematics, because it seems like what mathematicians do is make up definitions and then categorise things according to them. But they don’t do this at all — they identify relevantly different properties first, and then they deduce the underlying definitions that cause these properties. If you do this properly, you cannot fail to understand why the differences exist at a fairly fundamental level. When mathematicians taxonomise, this is the end result of something they are doing far more rigorously and purposefully — not for the pure (pointless) joy of creating taxonomies.</p><p>Ironically, perhaps, cargo cult math strips the real joy from mathematics. I can virtually guarantee that any mathematician will tell you that the most prevalent and irritating misunderstanding of their discipline is the idea that mathematics is not creative. That it is ‘analytical’ (Christ, what an awful weasel word) rather than ‘creative’, ‘expressive’, or ‘imaginative’, as if worthwhile creativity were possible without knowledge and understanding. I challenge anybody skeptical of this outlook to find a product of the human mind from the twentieth century more creative than Alan Turing’s On Computable Numbers or Claude Shannon’s A Mathematical Theory of Communication. Only from a base of profound creativity do worthwhile taxonomies emerge, and when they do, they are understood by their creators.</p><p>Mathematics is the language in which the understanding of consequence and causation is best coded and conveyed. I do not make these claims in any maximalist sense: I do not deny the genius behind what is more widely and traditionally thought of as ‘creative’ — Guernica, Beloved, and The Second Piano Concerto rank up there too from the twentieth century, but note that Picasso, Morrison, and Rachmaninov all understood what they were doing … The problem isn’t even that this causes me moral or aesthetic concern, although it does, but rather because I sincerely believe this precise, identifiable pathology causes tangible harm in the real world. We are in serious danger of living through an unrelenting explosion of cargo cult math, because the pure pointless joy of creating ever more complicated, and not at-all understood, taxonomies is becoming cheaper and cheaper due to advances in cloud computing and artificial intelligence.</p><p>To be clear, I have no issue with artificial intelligence. It’s fascinating stuff, as mathematics, and it will be surely be profound as a driver of economic productivity and human wellbeing. I am not arguing against practitioners who know what they are doing. I am arguing — much as I am sure the former would, even more forcefully — against practitioners who don’t know what they are doing, but who are doing it nonetheless because it is cheap, and getting cheaper. I have noted before the tasty irony that a field born out of the purest of pure mathematics is now powering a conceptual shift towards the ever-more applied. There I joyfully gave the positive case. Here I sternly make the negative case. We need to learn to identify cargo cult math to root out epidemics before they start. Is your child engaging in cargo cult math? How can you be sure? This is only partly a joke.</p><p>Once you grasp this, you will start seeing it everywhere. I called it ‘intellectual anthropology’ because I think it is a pathology of general thinking, unconfined to any specific area of inquiry. I will diagnose two areas in which cargo cult math has definitely taken hold, but only because I am relatively familiar with them. I welcome totally different case studies in the comments or on Twitter. These areas are: finance, via microeconomics, and statistics. I will conclude with an optimistic note on where cargo cult math is not only being opposed, but arguably is being overcome: complexity science, and a case study I find particularly fascinating on the natural scaling laws of biological organisms. I contemplated critically covering macroeconomics as well, but regular readers (if any exist) are likely bored of me talking about this by now. Look up Modern Monetary Theory if you think I’m exaggerating how simultaneously stupid, serious, and hilarious the consequences can be. In finance I’m moving on to the more applied. But remember, it’s going to be everywhere. Get vaccinated while there’s still time.</p>♦photo by Adit Avyas, via Unsplash<p>Finance</p><p>Alex Adamou and Ole Peters run the London Mathematical Laboratory, and I have had the pleasure of meeting both and discussing a number of their ideas. One of the research projects of the LML is to rethink the mathematics of microeconomics by more rigorously analysing the extent to which economic observables are or are not ‘ergodic’.</p><p>Now this is a dense concept, drawn from physics, that will at first seem bizarre to apply to economics. But unlike my occasional ramble on Medium, the good people at the LML have worked through this theory meticulously. Here I provide only brief coverage of their vast work, and specifically tease out the implications for finance, and this is more a commercial for their work than anything else. The reader is encouraged to follow up on two links in particular. The first is legendary asset manager, financial commentator, and finance professor Michael Mauboussin interviewing Peters on this topic. It requires a sliver of background knowledge of finance but otherwise should be accessible. Peters does a great job of explaining the physics, and the point of the interview is to introduce these concepts from scratch to financial professionals. The second is the full lecture notes, in all their glory. I’d selfishly suggest as a reason to first tolerate me rather than going straight to their work is that Peters is exceptionally diplomatic to those he criticises in the interview. I, on the other hand, see no need for such nonsense when the stakes are this high …</p><p>Economists often apply concepts from physics and sometimes this makes no sense. One example is a concept from statistical mechanics called ‘ergodicity’. Stated succinctly, an ergodic observable is one whose time and ensemble averages are equal. In other words, measuring an observable over a long time in a single system and at a single time over many systems produces two sets of measurements, whose average values are the same. This can happen in many ways. Usually we imagine that the observable for each system ends up, after long time, being drawn from a common and stable probability distribution. In effect, there is convergence to an equilibrium regime in which all trajectories look the same, statistically speaking.</p><p>Statistical physicists, starting with Boltzmann, developed the idea of ergodicity to justify using ensemble averages to model macroscopic quantities, such as pressure and temperature in fluids. Really, these are better described as time averages over bajillions of classically mechanical collisions. The latter are hard (read: impossible) to compute, while the former are a doddle once the stable probability distribution is known.</p><p>One upshot is that the ordering of observations, or, if you prefer, the direction of time, doesn’t matter when computing the average of an ergodic observable. Every system will, over enough time, visit every possible state with the same frequency as every other system. An observation can be dependent on previous observations but this dependence decays quickly. After a sufficient separation time, pairs of observations look causally unrelated — like independent draws from a fixed distribution.</p><p>A great deal of financial modelling uses techniques — most notably expectation values — which are appropriate only if the corresponding observables are ergodic. Typically, they are not. (Indeed, one trick is to find transformed observables which are, so that the techniques can be rescued.) In what is called ‘modern portfolio theory’, by which a scarily large proportion of asset allocation in the financial services industry is carried out, this is a particularly egregious error. Clearly events that are represented by numbers in finance are causally dependent on one another and take place in a world in which time has a direction. Contrary to widespread belief, malignantly infectious in finance itself, financial capital is merely a representation of production capital. The numbers in finance are not a closed game, but reflect things in the real world, where causation is most definitely a thing (causation ‘has ontological status’ as a mathematician friend of mine once enjoyed quipping of whatever either was or was not a thing). Acting as if none of these totally obvious observations are true leads to making mathematical statements about finance that are internally consistent but not even wrong. They are too meaningless to be wrong. They are just gibberish.</p><p>One such observation concerns the Sharpe Ratio; the excess return of an investment over the ‘risk free rate’ divided by its standard deviation, usually given an interpretation along the lines of, return adjusted for risk. (side note: in what world can a ‘rate’, as in a numerical representation of the compounding of capital over time due to reinvested profits, be ‘free’ of ‘risk’? Mark Spitznagel, are you listening? Do you have any thoughts or are you too mad to articulate them?) Peters’ and Adamou’s insight is that the Sharpe Ratio is not dimensionless. A dimensionless constant is one that has no units. All pure numbers are like this — pi, e, etc. — but so are things like the proton-electron mass ratio and the strong force characterisation. You don’t need to have any idea what these physically mean (I don’t!), but the point of any dimensionful constant is that the number will change when you change the units. The (numerical) speed of light changes if you use feet rather than meters, or hours rather than seconds, and so while the speed of light in an absolute sense is important, any number associated with it cannot be fundamental. This is why you just set it to 1 in general relativity — there is no reason not to and it makes the algebra much easier.</p><p>The Sharpe Ratio, often held up as a kind of sacred, pure, and fundamental characteristic of the concept of ‘risk-adjusted returns’ is not dimensionless, meaning that it is not fundamental and can be changed based on the units of its dimensions. Its dimensions are one over the square root of time, or just ‘time’ for the purposes of this discussion. This is very dangerous territory to be plodding around in if we aren’t clear on how ‘time’ itself behaves in the system for which we have chosen a supposedly fundamental characterizing number, the dimensions of which are time …</p><p>Suppose, for example, that we think ‘the speed of light’ is foundationally meaningful as a dimensionless constant because we are silly geese. We then start changing the units in order to confuse ourselves. We change it from meters per second to centimeters per second, then again to millimeters, then micrometers and watch what happens to the number. OH MY GOD, IT’S GETTING BIGGER! It’s going faster and faster!</p><p>* pause to contain hysterical laughter and regain our faculties before getting super real *</p><p>Now consider the Sharpe ratio. Its units are one over sqrt(time). Let’s do something sneaky and change time from a year to a month. Then again to a week. Then to a day. OH MY GOD, IT’S GETTING SMALLER! The risk-adjusted returns are going down and down! This might seem rather obvious as both ‘risk’ and ‘returns’ are borne out over time. But we can be even sneakier and use leverage. Obviously if we have positive expected returns then leverage will magnify them. But will it change our risk-adjusted returns? No, it does not. The Sharpe Ratio does not change with leverage. I don’t want to diverge too far into the algebra of this, but for readers vaguely familiar with the concept, the Sharpe Ratio is the gradient of the efficient frontier, which is a straight line if a risk free asset is available (and hence can be used to provide leverage). So applying leverage moves the portfolio up the efficient frontier with precisely the numerical effects on ‘risk’ and ‘return’ that does not change the Sharpe Ratio. So now what can we do? We can invest over as short a period as possible to get risk and return as low as possible, then juice returns with leverage, and apply repeatedly over time periods that compound back up to a full year. We should juice the units like this more often! Except that in this example, that’s exactly what has happened in real life, in trillions of dollars’ worth of capital allocation decisions over at least 40 years.</p><p>There are a number of dire philosophical errors implicit in this approach. One is the idea that the ‘risk’ of an investment decreases over shorter and shorter periods of time and due to no other factor. Nope, it turns out that leverage makes no difference to risk if we are investing over zero time (which ought to make you wonder what the word ‘investment’ even means, but forget about that for now) The other is that the appropriate average is drawn from the set of every possible outcome rather than the set of consequences of playing the same game repeatedly. What is the individual payoff in a game in which one million people each agree to one round of a one in ten thousand Russian roullette in exchange for $1000? It might not be so bad. What about if you, personally, committed to playing one million rounds of one in ten thousand Russian roulette and got $1000 every time you didn’t die? It doesn’t really matter exactly how much you value either game. What matters is realizing that they are different games. So too is a huge number of people each risking tiny possibilities of financial wipeout different to one person risking it a huge number of times in succession. The normal workings of an insurance company is different to the global financial crisis.</p><p>To tie this together mathematically, we can use leverage to drive the return rate of the ensemble-average portfolio to infinity, while keeping its risk-adjusted return rate within whatever bounds we choose. Yippee! Lever up! Never mind that the time-average of returns will converge to zero. No need to be a party pooper.</p><p>What a relief that time has no direction in finance and causation isn’t real! Otherwise, the math there could have gotten confusing really fast. I hate figuring out how to cancel infinities — is it L’Hôpital you use?</p><p>Sorry, enough math jokes. My point is basically that this whole thing is a massive math joke. It would be funnier if it wasn’t so dangerously stupid.</p><p>And it is really quite hard to describe just how stupid this is. It’s almost beyond stupid. It requires quite a high level of intelligence to make an assumption so wrong. It’s like somebody set out to make the most complicated and the most disastrous mistake they could, as a practical joke to see how much damage it could cause if believed. Welcome to ergodic finance, everybody. Leverage or not, the only thing that goes up in a crisis is correlation. In fact, leverage makes it worse.</p><p>While Peters limits himself to this area of finance as an especially egregious misapprehension of ergodicity, it is by no means the only example of cargo cult math in the industry. Most examples that come to mind easily for me all stem from a point alluded to above: the numbers in finance are not a closed game, but reflect things in the real world, where causation is most definitely a thing. To loop back to my worry about AI, which essentially stems from blindly trusting in ‘big data’, a good point to focus our suspicion is on statistics in finance in general.</p>♦Poisson distribution — Wikipedia by Skbkekas — n.b. you have no idea, dear reader, how difficult it is to find a decent free to use image that captures ‘statistics’, so we may as well look at a Poisson distribution because it’s going to come up shortly.<p>Statistics</p><p>Now as with AI, I am not claiming that statistics cannot be done properly. My concern, as with AI, is that the ever-increasing multitudes of data make it ever-more appealing to do statistics improperly. Statisticians presumably know what they are doing, by and large, although again, Taleb, for example, might strongly disagree in the bizarre corner case of all of social science. But I will not repeat here what he has covered in detail elsewhere, although I do recommend it — some comes full circle to Peters, actually. But the vast majority of applications of statistics outside mathematics and the natural sciences, as far as I can tell, is pseudo-intellectual nonsense. It often doesn’t even aspire to be meaningful; it is ‘bullshit’, which I use not as a crass insult, but in the philosophical sense developed by Harry Frankfurt that may be crisply captured as follows: an untruth that is not a lie, and so is not intended to deceive, but rather without the speaker having any genuine interest in the truth value of the proposition, and so proposed to achieve some other goal entirely having nothing to do with conveying a meaning. You have definitely encountered this. If anybody has ever said something like: “I think event x is y% likely,” they were almost certainly bullshitting; they were engaging in cargo cult math.</p><p>But before we get carried away, we should note that there are three reasons why maybe they were not. Firstly, they may have analytically derived a probability density function that describes the event space of x. Secondly, they may have constructed one synthetically by observing past happenings, but intuited that the future will not necessarily resemble the past and so used this distribution as an indication of a base rate to be deviated from, given the essentially different characteristics of the likely future to the known past. Thirdly, they were proposing odds for what they deemed to be a fair bet. There is a fourth option that has shades of all of these, but unfortunately makes absolutely no sense: they may have been giving a sense of their ‘conviction’ in a prediction. This is a classic concept of cargo cult math. It really is a first ballot hall of famer. Like all good cargo cult math (or science) it looks very much like a rigorous and serious thing to say. It’s a number. That’s a good start. If they are really sneaky, it will be a non-obvious but still fairly round number; nobody takes a 50% prediction seriously. But equally, nobody will take a 37.287% prediction seriously, because how could you possibly know something so precisely?</p><p>Pro tip: always predict things with 40% certainty. That way if the thing happens, you didn’t pick so low a number that your prediction seemed like you had a terrible conception of how likely it really was, but if it doesn’t happen then you’re still fine because you said it was less than 50% likely.</p><p>But my satirical advice only works if its audience is already committed to cargo cult math — it clearly has no real information content. What it sneakily elides is that a 40% prediction is the same as a 40.000% prediction, which is exactly as precise as 37.287% prediction. Clearly then, any prediction is spuriously precise. How can you possibly predict anything with any such level of precision? There are three real rigorous ways, which I already outlined above. But I would suggest that it is extremely unlikely that this is what has actually happened. If the ‘conviction level’ is specifically a prediction about the future, then option 1 is almost certainly out because they don’t know enough about statistics to explain how they derived a probability density function. Option two can be copped out of also because ‘the future won’t be like the past’. But option 3 is your ace in the hole. If you think the probability of some outcome is x%, and that (1-x)/x : 1 is therefore a fair bet, then a price lower than x means odds better than those you deem to be fair. If you don’t take such a bet, then you don’t really believe your prediction. As the economist Alex Tabarrok popularized, “a bet is a tax on bullshit.” This is one small way you can chip away at cargo cult math. If somebody makes a bullshit cargo cult math prediction, challenge them to a bet based on the odds implied. If they take the bet, that will actually be a very healthy sign, so be sure you aren’t bluffing to begin with or else it could get embarrassing. If there are prohibitions on gambling in whatever setting to which this approach might be desirous to implement, you can always do it for trivial amounts of money so that the point is more one of pride, or you could commit to full ‘pride monetisation’ by computing Brier scores over a long period of prediction of unrelated events. This isn’t perfect, by any means, but frankly anything that forces skin in the game — even reputational skin — is better than nothing, and will very probably cut down on the bullshit. Whatever the method, in the long run, you will help weed out pernicious cases of people who have no idea what they are talking about openly engaging in cargo cult math for some reason other than contributing to the correct prediction — professional prestige, for example, or misguided institutional architectures that pressure participants to make meaningless predictions they would rather not.</p><p>The statistical equivalent of the ‘risk free rate’ is almost certainly that of ‘statistical significance’. Like ‘risk free rate’ it has a sensible enough technical definition: that the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis is higher than the probability of observing a value equal to or more extreme than the variate, given the null hypothesis is true. I won’t dwell on this for long as I am indebted to Stephen Ziliak and Deirdre McClosky and their brilliant, The Cult of Statistical Significance. As the reader can probably tell, they are not fans either. The two take aim at the sizeless scientist who cares only about establishing to an entirely arbitrary degree of certainty that an effect is real, and cares not at all for how big or small the effect is,</p><p>“After Galton and Pearson, and especially after Ronald Fisher, the statistical sciences have slipped into asking a philosophical and qualitative question about existence instead. The scientific question is how much this particular bridge, or a bridge of this particular kind, can tolerate thus-and-such forces of stress. There may ‘exist’ a stable bridge. But unless the magnitude and limits of stability can be given quantitatively in the world we actually inhabit the knowledge of whether it exists is unhelpful. No astronomer is interested in the question of whether there is some effect of the rest of the galaxy’s gravitation on the Oort cloud. No scientific brewer of Guinness will ask whether bitterness ‘exists’ — as a careful student of hops chemistry, and a profit center, he is forced to ask how much. The question of whether has, as John Dewey observed, ‘no scientific meaning,’ no big bang. Being ‘exlucsively theoretical’ no curiosity is aroued by it because it makes ‘no difference’ anywhere. Not even in philosophy, pragmatically considered, the great philosopher said.”</p><p>The book’s subtitle is, How the Standard Error Cost us Jobs, Justice and Lives, and after laying out the theory, the latter chapters of the book explore the widespread abuse of statistical illiteracy in economics, psychology, medicine, biology, law, and more. I know far less about these fields than I do about finance, and besides, they have already written the book, so I encourage the reader to go read it. Especially if they use statistics in their work.</p><p>The root of the problem I am most interested in is that statistical analysis of anything, ever, is only as useful as the samples available are representative of the population. Statistical significance is irrelevant to this determination. The problem described in various guises above is that the bullshitters have little conception of what such a representation could or should mean. But an even more insidious problem can easily creep into the work of the cargo cult mathematician. The bullshitter knows that what she is saying is bullshit. But the financier may well either believe his sample is representative of the population or, even worse, not think for long enough to realise that this condition is essential in the first place, possibly stopping after hitting statistical significance. In finance, we are always implicitly assuming that the true population extends into the future, otherwise what’s the point? You can’t trade in the past! This creates a serious problem that the reader has probably realized: causation is real; creativity is real; people are not automatons and economic activity does not follow differential equations; therefore, no financial sample is ever representative of the population. Even if the sample is literally everything that has ever happened. It still won’t work. Thinking is required. By a human.</p><p>I’m going to be even more obnoxious about this in case the reader is unconvinced of how big a problem it is. I think that most people in the modern world simply have no idea what statistics is for or what it tells you. Especially in finance. Mathematical statistics developed in the late 19th century as a tool for physical science to solve one pretty generic problem which had countless specific instances: how well does the observed data fit my mathematically articulated theory? Now, most worryingly outside of physical sciences, it is (mis)used to solve an utterly fallacious problem: what mathematically articulated theory can be provided to fit the observed data? This is a completely different question, and if you are even asking it to begin with then you very probably don’t understand statistics or math or science.</p><p>For starters, at no point in the second approach do you understand — or even attempt to understand — the phenomena you are observing. What you are actually doing is adopting a circa-seventeenth century philosophy of science of mindless induction: what happened before is what will happen again. Why? Because our result is statistically significant. And what’s worse is you are perverting the most extraordinarily powerful explanatory toolkit ever devised to make it seem like what you are doing is legitimate science, making it even less likely that you will realize this mistake. “But I did statistics!” No, you did cargo cult math.</p><p>It was actually recently put to a group I was part of, in an entirely serious setting, that the reason we assign a probability of ½ to a coin landing heads is because that is what the data indicates, and not because of the symmetry of the coin. Like infinite returns, you really have to be quite clever to believe something so stupid. But this is not at all atypical. This is a perfect case study of exactly how AI will abuse meaningful statistics entirely to death. I contemplated making a point along the following lines: what then do probability density functions mean? Take the Poisson distribution, for example. This tells us the probability that a number of independent but probabilistically identical events with known frequency will occur in a given timeframe. There are infinitely many Poisson distributions because each is parameterized by λ, the expected number of occurrences of a single event. λ is a real number, and so there is some λ — call it p — for which no Poisson distribution has ever been measured, what with our universe being finite and all. Were we to engineer an event that we know will behave according to Poisson-p could we predict anything about it? I say yes, because we understand statistics; they say no, because this has never happened before. We can’t possibly know anything. We have to wait and see.</p><p>There is a traditional teaching point about the purpose of theories and logic in science that is usually articulated as follows: the single most accurate theory is a list of every observation ever made. Why is it so good? Well, it correctly predicts every observation ever made! huzzah! The approach I am criticising takes this (obvious joke) a step further by saying — take this theory of everything ever observed, do a linear regression, check for statistical significance, and then have a theory of everything that will have an answer for every question.</p><p>Consider this excerpt from John Kay’s wonderful book, Other People’s Money, the title of which unsubtly hints at why this behavior is so repugnant:</p><p>“David Viniar, CFO of Goldman Sachs, claimed as the global financial crisis broke in August 2007 that his bank had experienced ’25 standard deviation events’ several days in a row. But anyone with a knowledge of statistics (a group that must be presumed to include Viniar) knows that the occurrence of several ’25 standard-deviation events’ within a short time is impossible. What he meant to say was that the company’s risk models failed to describe what had happened. Extreme observations are generally the product of ‘off-model’ events. If you toss a coin a hundred times and all the tosses are heads, you may have encountered a once in a lifetime statistical freak; but look first for a simpler explanation. For all their superficial sophistication, the masters of the universe had no real understanding of what was going on before them.”</p><p>And,</p><p>“Investors look at economic fundamentals; traders look at each other; ‘quants’ look at the data. Dealing on the basis of historic price series was once described as technical analysis, or chartism (and there are chartists still). These savants identify visual patterns in charts of price data, often favouring them with arresting names such as ‘head and shoulders’ or ‘double bottoms’. This is pseudo-scientific bunk, the financial equivalent of astrology. But more sophisticated quantitative methods have since proved profitable for some since the 1970s’ creation of derivative markets and the related mathematics.”</p><p>By ‘mathematics’, Kay of course means cargo cult math (here is some real math, if the reader is at all interested) and by ‘the company’s risk models failed to describe what had happened’, Kay means, ‘they thought they were playing a numerical game, didn’t seem to realise that the numbers reflected happenings in the non-ergodic real world, and really just had absolutely no idea what they were doing.’ If, for whatever reason, you want to generate some 25 standard deviation events, applying some cargo cult math is probably a good start. David Swensen recounts a similar episode from some 15 years prior in his best-seller Pioneering Portfolio Management,</p><p>“Granite Capital’s David Askin suffered devastating losses while pursuing an apparently sophisticated strategy of identifying, hedging, and leveraging pricing anomalies in mortgage-backed security derivatives. Based on a record of generating mid-teens returns with low variability, Askin attracted funds from an impressive list of investors, including the Rockefeller Foundation and McKinsey &amp; Company. Unfortunately, explicit and implicit leverage caused the firm’s entire $600m portfolio to be wiped out in a matter of weeks.</p><p>Askin invested in collateralised mortgage obligation derivatives with exotic names such as super-inverse interest-only strips. As unusual as the names might be, the securities simply represented pieces of pools containing ordinary home mortgages. By combining securities expected to respond in opposite ways to interest rate movements, Askin hoped to be hedged; when rates move, profits on one part of the portfolio would more or less offset losses on the other. If Askin correctly identified pricing anomalies, profits would exceed losses by a margin equal to the mispricing.</p><p>Because mispricings in fixed income markets tend to be small, investors frequently use leverage to magnify the portfolio impact of trades. At the time of his denouement, Askin employed leverage of approximately two and one half times, running positions of $2 billion on $600 million of equity.</p><p>Askin’s portfolio failed to weather the trauma caused by the Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates in early 1994. What appeared to be well-hedged positions in a benign interest rate environment turned out to be wildly mismatched positions in a bearish bond market. As Askin’s portfolio accumulated losses, investment banks that lent money to fund the positions seized the bonds, selling positions to cover their exposure. The combination of poor portfolio structure and leverage led to Askin’s downfall.”</p><p>Or, alternatively, Askin forgot that causation is real and that the population on which he was performing fantastic statistical analysis extended into the future, a strange place in which things are usually different to the present or past. Although Kay did also allude to the existence of real ‘investors’ above, I worry I may have inadvertently convinced the reader that actually nobody knows anything and finance is all a joke. David Swensen is one of — if not the most — renowned endowment managers in history, and this excerpt comes from a section on how not to do finance. Some people do know what they are doing. What a relief. Elsewhere in his (excellent) book, Swensen joyfully mocks the investment approach that inevitably results from a feeling of having all the data:</p><p>“More succinct advice to those who must time markets comes from remarks attributed to a nineteenth-century cotton trader: ‘Some think it will go up. Some think it will go down. I do, too. Whatever you do will be wrong. Act at once.’”</p><p>And so, the reader will hopefully be relieved to know that not all finance is a tragic cargo cult. But they will also be forgiven for having received that impression from the media. Production capital that takes years or even decades to give its long-term investors a handsome return is nowhere near as sexy as high frequency trading in financial capital whose associated production nobody has time to look up. But it’s also why we don’t live in caves and hunt antelope, among other reasons. Cavemen presumably traded nuts and berries at relatively high frequencies, which achieved absolutely nothing in terms of long term improvements in labour productivity. Amongst the most quoted passages of Keynes’ General Theory is this gem,</p><p>“Of the maxims of orthodox finance none, surely, is more anti-social than the fetish of liquidity, the doctrine that it is a positive virtue on the part of investment institutions to concentrate their resources upon the holding of ‘liquid’ securities. It forgets that there is no such thing as liquidity of investment for the community as a whole. The social object of skilled investment should be to defeat the dark forces of time and ignorance which envelop our future. The actual, private object of the most skilled investment to-day is ‘to beat the gun’, as the Americans so well express it, to outwit the crowd, and to pass the bad, or depreciating, half-crown to the other fellow.”</p><p>The image problem that finance faces stems from precisely the fact that almost everything is liquid. And if the thing itself isn’t, then some derivative on it probably is. Liquidity invites trading, trading generates data, and worship of such data quickly descends into cargo cult math. But it also invites excitement, and excitement makes for compelling narratives. This is more or less why, no matter their attempts at using logic and reasoning, of which this essay will be just one more futile attempt in a long history of failure, practitioners of legitimate and responsible finance never seem to make much ground in the broader public imagination. It is why even the word ‘quantitative’ is most habitually applied to ‘finance’, to which it least belongs, and as an afterthought to physics, chemistry, and biology, to which it is key. Luckily, there are some who are especially committed to turning this around …</p>♦photo by Michael Olsen, via Unsplash<p>Complexity Science</p><p>The fatal conceit of most cargo cult math is that because some system seems complex, any simplification of it is worthwhile. The problem is that a taxonomy that doesn’t touch on any underlying simplicity of structure is not a simplification at all, but an obfuscation. It makes things more complicated, not less. A relatedly amusing problem is that ‘complex’ actually has a meaning — like many terms cargo cult mathematicians imprecisely deploy. It describes a category of underlying conditions of a system that, as I outlined at the very beginning, fundamentally explain its macroscopic state. This is real mathematics. To end on a cheery note and avoid giving the reader the impression that everything is awful and everybody is deluded, I will lay out some of the most accessible results of this branch of mathematics, complexity science.</p><p>Most of the examples given come from the excellent Scale, by Geoffrey West, but I stress that this is not a book review. Scale is a popular science book largely adapted from West’s own work, and that of his colleagues at the Santa Fe Institute, whereas I simply extract a few readily understood case studies of the kinds of insights that can be generated by these techniques. First, though, I highlight a quote that entirely coincidentally captures the frustration of this entire essay,</p><p>“Although the term ‘social physics’ faded from the scientific landscape it has been resurrected more recently by scientists from various backgrounds who have started to address social science questions from a more quantitative analytic viewpoint typically associated with the paradigmatic framework of traditional physics. Much of the work that my colleagues and I have been involved in and which will be elucidated in some detail in later chapters could be described as social physics, although it is not a term an of us uses with ease. Ironically, it has been picked up primarily by computer scientists, who are neither social scientists nor physicists, to describe their analysis of huge data sets on social interactions. As they characterize it: ‘Social Physics is a new way of understanding human behavior based on analysis of Big Data.’ While this body of research is very interesting, it is probably safe to say that few physicists would recognize it as ‘physics,’ primarily because it does not focus on underlying principles, general laws, mathematical analyses, and mechanistic explanations.”</p><p>Quite, Geoffrey, quite. You say, ‘does not focus on underlying principles’, I say, ‘have no idea what they are talking about,’ but I gave up any pretence of diplomacy pretty much at the beginning of the essay. If your lack of understanding of the ‘underlying principles’ of the subjective value of autonomous individuals leads you to to employ ten times leverage on numerology, you are not simply ‘not a physicist’, you are a dangerous lunatic. Let’s focus on some underlying principles, then shall we?</p><p>As an example, consider the following intriguing property that holds within remarkably small errors across all mammals: the metabolic rate — energy expensed over time — is proportional to the mass of the mammal to the power of ¾ — also known as Kleiber’s Law (which actually applies to many more types of animals, but restricting it to mammals reveals yet further structure) For every doubling in the mass of a mammal, its metabolic rate goes up 75%, meaning there is a kind of 25% ‘efficiency savings’ with scale. A mammal 10,000 times bigger than another will consume only 1,000 times as much energy. And yet there is a smallest and largest mammal: the Etruscan shrew and the blue whale. Across the two dimensions of mass and metabolic rate, all mammalian life exists on one straight line (when plotted logarithmically) with two distinct endpoints. Why? West teases,</p><p>“Is all of this solely arbitrary and capricious, the result of millions of tiny accidents and fluctuations in our long history that have been frozen in place by the process of natural selection, at least for the time being? Or is there some order here, some hidden pattern reflecting other mechanisms at work?”</p><p>This certainly seems like a ‘hidden order’, but does it have a cause? What follows is about as concise an explanation of this phenomenon as I can manage. It does not at all do justice to what is around 100 pages of West’s book, but the impression I want to give is not really one about biology, but about what kind of uses of mathematical thinking are real and legitimate, as opposed to stemming from a data driven cargo cult. The short answer is that there are three mathematical principles at play: one optimization principle that follows from the fractal self-similarity of scaling up or down the circulatory system of mammals with differing masses; and two thresholds for kinds of ‘stress’ on the system imposed by other parts of its construction that are tolerable up to a certain bound.</p><p>The gist of the proportionality in scaling is as follows: biological building blocks are mostly, if not entirely, discrete, meaning the terminal units across all animals are invariant. Some consequences of this are obvious, such as blood cells having the same mass and volume across animals, but other consequences are less so, such as capillaries also having the same size across mice, men, and whales. But the increased mass of a whale requires far more capillaries, given that every cell must be (more or less) reached by the circulatory network. A whale is ten million times the mass of a shrew but it doesn not have ten million tiny shrew hearts. It has one heart that must service (the order of) ten million times as many capillaries. The network in between must be space-filling, a technical term that thankfully means exactly what it sounds like.</p><p>This all suggests a kind of optimality in network design, in that there will in principle be a some kind of circulatory system that uses optimal energy to move some minimum requirement of stored energy to every terminal unit. Any other system will either use more energy than necessary in delivery or won’t deliver enough energy to begin with. It is also reasonable to expect that, due to natural selection, something like the optimal system would dominate its peers and would be passed on, since minimizing energy used in this basic, involuntary, and life-sustaining, activity, maximises the energy available for eating, fighting, and reproducing. The primary concern for maximizing the efficiency of a beating heart is to minimize the reflections produced by bloodflow at any branching points in the network. If the sum of the cross sectional areas of daughter tubes is equal to that of the parent tube, there will in theory be no reflections at a branch point. But given the cross sectional area of the tubes is (more or less) circular due to other optimization conditions, so there will always be a slight turbulence as the tube deforms to be able to branch. The simplest design that minimizes this turbulence is to split into two daughter tubes. These constraints combine to suggest a fractal geometry both within and across mammalian circulatory systems, such that the circulatory systems of larger mammals are ‘scaled up’ versions of those in smaller ones.</p><p>But scaled up how? The fractal geometry of the space-filling nature of the network is key. A ‘fractal dimension’ is, in the most general terms, a quantification of the complexity of a curve as revealed by the scale at which it is examined. West treats this part of the argument in a fairly fluffy manner in the book, saying that it is ‘as if the circulatory system earns an extra dimension to expand by’, thus scaling efficiently. I don’t say this to diminish the prose, but just to make sure the reader isn’t confused as to whether they were supposed to follow that or not. The more rigorous explanation is a bit much for this essay, but the interested reader can easily look up what is called the WBE model (West, Brown, Enquist). The short version, with no explanation of where this formula comes from, is that given the constraints of; mass scales linearly with terminal units, the distribution is hierarchical, vessels within the same level of the hierarchy are equivlent, the branching ratio is constant, the network is space filling, and energy waste is minimized; then the scaling exponent for metabolic rate with mass, a, will be a = ln N / ln λ (β²), where β is the ratio of the radii of daughter branches to the radii of the parent branch, λ is the ratio of the sum of volumes of daughter branches to the volume of the parent branch, and N is the total number of capillaries in the network. Given we specified the network bifurcates, β is N^(-1/2) and λ is N^(-1/3), meaning the formula becomes a = — ln N / ln N ^ (-1/3) * (N ^ (-1/2)) ^ 2 = — ln N/ (-4/3) ln N = ¾ ln N / ln N = ¾.</p><p>The lower bound on mass comes from the simple fact that the viscocity of blood means that only a certain size of vessel can support the force of pulsatory waves produced by a beating heart. In fact, all mammals have very close to 15 levels supporting nonpulsatile waves. But the terminal units are invariant, meaning that the 15 are all around the same size, after which there are successively damped pulsatile vessels leading back to the heart. This damping causes lost energy, and so in the spirit of minimizing energy usage, there must be at least a few levels of branching before the entirely nonpulsatile region begins. The size of the terminal units, the density and viscosity of blood, the elsasticity of arterial walls, and other such biological constants, can be used to derive the theoretically smallest mass of mammal, which happens to match very closely the Etruscan shrew, at just a few grams.</p><p>The upper bound comes from a different scaling law determining that the distance between the terminal units — in this case, capillaries — scales with mass with an exponent of 1/12. This is a relatively small exponent, and so a blue whale being 100 million times heavier than a shrew results in its capillaries being only 4.6 times further apart. However, capillaries are (more or less) invariant, meaning the same size of capillary has to deliver energy to more and more cells as mass increases. The distance that oxygen can diffuse across capillary walls and through tissue has a theoretical limit known as Krogh’s radius. As above, this, along with the mass of cells, and other such constants can be used to derive the theoretically largest mass of mammal, which happens to be very close to the blue whale, at 200 tons.</p><p>There are (at least) two fascinating things about these results. The more obvious, and the point of West’s book, is that understanding both the physical relevance of the biological constants of life and the mathematical interpretation of the mechanical systems life seems to have evolved produces incredibly powerful and accurate explanations for broad ranges of varieties of life. And by ‘powerful’ I do not at all mean ‘complicated’ but almost the exact opposite. The explanations are simple; they involve isolating constants that relate enormous ranges of observed data. But secondly, and more delightfully from my point of view and to this essay, is that these constants do not derive from learned machines crunching masses of data. In fact, they can be derived from no data whatsoever by understanding the conditions of the system producing the data in the first place. Good luck asking a statistical significance chasing hedge fund manager for that …</p><p>No, this is real mathematics, with nary a cargo cult in sight.</p><p>Follow me @allenf32</p>♦

<p>Ralph Merkle, inventor of cryptographic hashing and namesake of the
Merkle tree, made the argument that Bitcoin is the first example of a
new form of life. In this article series, I intend to take this claim
seriously, explore it further, and see what can be gleaned from viewing
Bitcoin as a living organism.</p>

<p>The first part will establish that Bitcoin is indeed a living organism.
The second part will take a closer look at Bitcoin’s various habitats,
and how changes in these habitats might affect the organism. In the
third part we will dissect the Bitcoin organism, trying to understand
some of its parts in more detail. Finally, we will perform the thought
experiment of trying to kill Bitcoin, to illustrate the remarkable
resilience of this strange, decentralized organism.</p>

What is Life?

<p>The question of whether something is alive or not obviously hinges on
one’s definition of life. Life is endlessly complex, so it is no
surprise that answering the question “What is Life?” leads to a
multitude of answers. New-age speculations aside, it seems that life is
a process, not a substance.</p>

<p>We can try to describe this process by looking at things which are
alive, and looking at what they do: they tend to grow, reproduce, and
respond. They inherit traits, are made up of smaller units (cells), and
use energy to maintain their internal structure in the face of entropy.</p>



  ♦


  Based on Chris Packard's Characteristics of Life, cc-by-sa 4.0



<p>From a physics perspective, living things are thermodynamic systems:
they utilize the energy-differences in their surroundings to maintain a
specific molecular organization and create copies of themselves.
Thermodynamically speaking, living systems are able to decrease their
internal entropy at the expense of “free” energy taken in from the
environment. In short, living things create order out of chaos.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is doing exactly that: it takes energy from the environment and
puts things in order, i.e. it decreases its internal entropy. It does so
by appending blocks to a well-ordered structure. Some call this
structure the blockchain, others call it a distributed ledger. I will
refrain from using either name, since the name of this particular
structure isn’t important, and doesn’t help to convey a deeper truth:
that this structure is just one part of a large and complex system, just
like the backbone in vertebrates. It is important, no doubt. But
distributed or not, a ledger on its own is as useful and as alive as a
bag of bones.</p>

<p>To understand why Bitcoin behaves animatedly we will have to look beyond
the buzzwords and ask ourselves what Bitcoin actually is, what it is
made of, and what its boundaries are.</p>

What is Bitcoin?

<p>Compared to biological life, Bitcoin is quite simple. Nevertheless,
finding a succinct answer to “What is Bitcoin?” is not.</p>

<p>Depending on your background it might be a computer network, a financial
revolution, a way to protect your wealth, a payment system, a global
settlement layer, an alternative to central banking, sound money, a
parallel economy, an exercise in free speech, a bubble, a pyramid
scheme, a messaging system, a communications protocol, an inefficient
database, internet money, or all of the above. In short, Bitcoin is
different things to different people.</p>

<p>Whatever Bitcoin might be, it undoubtedly is a force to be reckoned
with. It has a life of its own, and thus arguably, it is best described
as a living thing.</p>

<p>Many people seem to have come to this conclusion independently. Bitcoin
is described as an army of leaf-cutter ants in Andreas M.
Antonopoulos’ Mastering Bitcoin — a biological system which is
working in concert without a central coordinator. The honey badger, an
animal which is commonly used to refer to Bitcoin (since it doesn’t care
and isn’t afraid of anything) is on the cover of Jimmy Song’s
Programming Bitcoin. Dan Held compared the invention of Bitcoin to
planting a tree, examining the species (code), season (timing), soil
(distribution), and gardening (community) that were essential to its
success. Brandon Quittem postulates that Bitcoin is most similar to
mycelium, the underground network which powers the fungi kingdom, and
can thus be best understood as a decentralized organism.</p>



  ♦




<p>The snake of regulation and central banking is biting you while you are
eating it alive? Honey badger don’t care! And just like an army of
ants doesn’t care if half of the workers are washed away by a flood, the
Bitcoin network doesn’t care if half of the nodes are offline tomorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Honey badger don’t care, honey badger don’t give a fuck.”
<cite>Randall</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Memes like these, especially if they survive and continue to be popular
over a long period of time, tend to be right, conceptually. What people
seem to be saying when they refer to Bitcoin as the honey badger is
that, in essence, Bitcoin behaves like an animal which can’t be
controlled, can’t be tamed, and doesn’t care too much about
externalities.</p>

<p>Which particular organism Bitcoin resembles most closely will be left as
an exercise for the reader. The above examples should merely illustrate
that multiple authors made the intellectual leap of classifying Bitcoin
as a living organism - a leap which I believe to be fascinating, useful,
and ultimately, correct.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a living organism, and we should try to understand it as such
if we want to live in harmony with it.</p>

The Bitcoin Organism

<p>As mentioned above, Ralph Merkle was the first to point out that Bitcoin
can be seen as a living entity. He remarked that Bitcoin has spawned an
incredible amount of excitement in the technical community, and tried to
translate this excitement into something which can be understood by
everybody: a new form of life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Briefly, and non-technically, Bitcoin is the first example of a new
form of life. It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because
it can pay people to keep it alive. It lives because it performs a
useful service that people will pay it to perform. It lives because
anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code. It lives because all the
running copies are constantly talking to each other. It lives because
if any one copy is corrupted it is discarded, quickly and without any
fuss or muss. It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can
see its code and see exactly what it does.”
<cite>Ralph Merkle</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Bitcoin is indeed radically transparent, it is not perfectly
obvious where Bitcoin begins and where it ends. Like all living things,
Bitcoin isn’t just a uniform blob of matter. It is a dynamic, living
thing, consisting of many different parts, all of which communicate with
and influence each other, as well as other living things and the
environment as a whole.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin organism is made up of many interlocking parts which work
together to ensure the survival of the whole. As with biological
organisms, as soon as one crucial part is missing, the whole organism is
bound to die.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, however, is a strange beast. It lives across domains, with one
foot in the purely informational realm (ideas and code) and one foot in
the physical realm (people and nodes).</p>



  ♦




<p>The Bitcoin organism manifests itself through the interplay of ideas,
code, people, and nodes. All four of these conceptual pieces react to
and influence each other in a value-generating feedback loop which
keeps Bitcoin alive.</p>

<p>Whether people are part of the Bitcoin organism, or merely living in
symbiosis with it, depends on your point of view. For now, let’s take an
all-encompassing view of the Bitcoin organism, including people as one
part of the whole. After all, just like we can’t live without a
multitude of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other creepy-crawlies which
make up the human microbiome, Bitcoin can’t live without us: the tiny
beings in meatspace which keep it alive.</p>

<p>In any case, nodes and their operators are tangible things which are
manifest in the physical world. Like the cells in your body, all
physical components of the Bitcoin organism can and will be replaced
over time. Node operators come and go, node and mining hardware is
replaced periodically, and even whole mining farms go offline and are
replaced by more cost-efficient facilities.</p>

<p>Ideas and code are more ethereal. They can’t be grasped or pointed to in
the same fashion. However, Bitcoin has an essence, the soul of the
organism, if you like. Note that this essence could, in theory, breathe
life into a new host if the current incarnation of the organism dies.
The ghost of Bitcoin is independent of its physical body, to borrow a
metaphor from Shirow’s Ghost in the Shell.</p>

<p>As long as something is compatible with this essence, it will be treated
as part of the whole. If something is incompatible, however, it will be
rejected — just like biological organisms reject foreign objects
inside their bodies.</p>

<p>Part of this essence is made explicit by Bitcoin’s consensus rules,
other parts are repeated as mantras: “not your keys, not your bitcoin”
and “run your own node” are gentle reminders of lessons learned, as
well as shortcuts to a deeper understanding of what Bitcoin is and
should be.</p>

<p>With a basic idea of the constituents and the extent of the Bitcoin
organism in mind, let’s return to the descriptive definition of life
above and see how Bitcoin maps onto each trait.</p>



  ♦




<ul>
  <li>Growth: Bitcoin grows in multiple ways. The network grows, the
value of each bitcoin grows, the market grows, its user base grows,
and the ecosystem as a whole grows as well.</li>
  <li>Reproduction: Paradoxically, Bitcoin uses replication to create
absolute scarcity. It reproduces itself in multiple ways, and on
multiple levels: the source code is replicated across repositories,
the software is copying itself upon installation, the ledger
reproduces itself on every node, blocks propagate across the network
by replication, and even UTXOs can be understood as reproductive
entities, dividing and merging during the transaction process.
Mutations exist on every level as well: invalid transactions,
invalid blocks, hundreds of forks, and thousands of imperfect copies
have been spawned by Bitcoin in the last couple of years.</li>
  <li>Heredity: Bitcoin inherits several traits from its
predecessors: public-key cryptography, digital signatures,
peer-to-peer networking, digital timestamping, and unforgeable
costliness — just to name a few. Further, Bitcoin’s open nature
enables both vertical and horizontal gene transfer: some traits
develop by gradual mutations of previous versions, others find their
way into the codebase by incorporating ideas from other
projects.</li>
  <li>Homeostasis: Above all else, Bitcoin’s consensus rules are
responsible for its stable inner conditions. If blocks do not adhere
to the current consensus rules, they will be rejected mercilessly
and quickly. The Bitcoin network will rid itself of these blocks
just like we shed the dead cells of our skin.</li>
  <li>Metabolism: Mining rigs around the world keep the organism
alive, erecting virtually impenetrable walls in the process.
Energy is transformed into digital amber, ensuring that the shield
around past transactions is growing and Bitcoin’s heart keeps
beating.</li>
  <li>Cellular: Multiple parts of Bitcoin are cellular: the Bitcoin
network consists of nodes, each of which a self-sustaining,
functional entity. The ledger itself is cellular since blocks (and
transactions) are basically cells in a large, append-only
spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Responsive: Bitcoin is a highly responsive organism. It
responds to changes in price, political changes, economic changes,
environmental changes (e.g. if parts of the internet are cut off),
technological changes (e.g. breakthroughs in chip manufacturing),
and changes in our scientific understanding (e.g. breakthroughs in
computer science, mathematics, or cryptography). It reacts on its
own, without any person, company, or nation-state in charge.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned above, life is a process, not a substance. A delicate dance
of innumerable parts, all signaling and communicating in an intricate
way to self-sustain each organism, and the phenomenon which we call life
as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Life is like fire, not water; it is a process, not a pure substance.
[…] The simplest, but not the only, proof of life is to find
something that is alive.”
<cite>Christopher McKay</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the words of astrobiologist Chris McKay, the simplest proof of life
is to find something that is alive. I have found Bitcoin, and as far as
I can tell, it is alive — for all the reasons outlined above.</p>



Conclusion

<p>Bitcoin checks all the boxes when it comes to the characteristics of
living things: it grows, reproduces, inherits and passes on traits, uses
energy to maintain a stable inner structure, is cellular in nature, and
responds to the various environments it lives in.</p>

<p>In the next part of this series we will take a closer look at these
environments, and how Bitcoin responds to changes in them. Bitcoin lives
and breathes on the internet, as Ralph Merkle beautifully said. But
arguably, the internet isn’t the only environment it is living in.</p>

<p>For now, I hope to have convinced you that Bitcoin can be seen as a
living organism — alien as it may be.</p>

  <p>Introducing the Bitcoin Difficulty Ribbon. When the ribbon compresses, or flips negative, these are the best times to buy Bitcoin. The ribbon consists of simple moving averages on mining difficulty so we can easily see the rate of change in difficulty.</p>♦How it the Difficulty Ribbon works<p>This visualisation of network mining difficulty speaks to the impact of mining on Bitcoin's price. As new coins are mined into existence, miners sell some of their mined coins to pay for production costs. This produces bearish price pressure.</p><p>The weakest miners sell more of their coins to remain operational. When it becomes unsustainable, they capitulate, hashing power and network difficulty reduces (ribbon compression), leaving only the strong, who sell less leaving more room for more bullish price action.</p><p>Typically we see this at the end of bear cycles, after miners capitulate, the lack of miner selling pressure allows the price to stabilise and then climb; the classic accumulation bottom.</p>♦<p>Credit goes to Vinny Lingham who was the first as far as I know to spot this dynamic in his April 2014 article on how Bitcoin finds its price equilibrium. We now have 5 more years of data to back it up.</p><p>Miners capitulate in bears, but also during block reward halvening events when suddenly only half the coins are mined for the same costs and the market price has yet to catch up to pay for it. We can easily see the compression after each halvening (marked as vertical lines) as miners die off.</p>♦<p>As a final note, notice how the 2019 the 2012 bull market have the same structure, we saw severe mining capitulation (i.e. the ribbon flipped negative), the resulting vacuum in selling pressure lead to a shorter accumulation band before price breakout. Thus this bull market has resembles 2012 more than 2016 structurally.</p>♦

  Using Litecoin when Sending Bitcoin Becomes Expensive♦<blockquote>This article was originally published on Glassnode Insights.</blockquote><p>If you’re no stranger to crypto, this is probably old news to you: The cryptocurrency market moves largely together, prices of digital assets correlate with each other.</p><p>Take a look at the following chart illustrating the correlation of price changes over time for BTC, ETH, and LTC.</p>♦<p>We used a daily rolling window and computed the yearly (previous 365 days) correlation of daily price changes. Note that this effect has been increasing over the years (reaching almost r=0.9), and only started to decline recently, in March 2019.</p>Prices Move Together — but what about On–Chain Activity?<p>At Glassnode we’re primarily concerned with on–chain activity of blockchains in order to fundamentally understand the behavioural economics of these networks.</p><p>So the obvious question we asked ourselves was: If the digital asset markets tend to move together, what about blockchain activity itself? Do we observe similar patterns when comparing on–chain data across multiple networks?</p><p>We took a close look at some core on–chain metrics (transactions count, transfer volume, addresses, and fees) on three major blockchains currently supported on the Glassnode platform: BTC, ETH, and LTC.</p><p>Below you can see an BTC-LTC correlation matrix of historic core on–chain metrics, as well the assets’ price in USD. We used data with a weekly resolution and de-trended it in order to account for non-stationarity by differencing subsequent datapoints, i.e. we used the change of values rather than the values themselves to compute the correlation coefficient.</p>♦<p>There’s a couple of immediate observations in this correlation analysis:</p><ul><li>First, in becomes instantly apparent that correlations across on–chain metrics (as well as price) between Bitcoin and Litecoin exist.</li><li>Second, these correlations are exclusively positive, i.e. the increase of one metric correlates with the increase of other metrics.</li><li>And third, these correlations are not restricted to the same metric across both blockchains, otherwise we would see a predominant diagonal line comprising high correlation values as compared to the rest of the matrix.In fact, we observe multiple strong cross-metric correlations (&gt; 0.6), most dominantly with respect to Bitcoin’s fee (5th row, Total Fee).</li></ul>Are these Correlations Bidirectional?<p>The observed on–chain metric correlations become more interesting when we assess the symmetry of correlations across chains.</p><p>A symmetric correlation here means that Metric I on Blockchain A correlates with Metric II on Blockchain B to the same extend as Metric I on Blockchain B correlates with Metric II on Blockchain A. Otherwise the correlation is considered asymmetric.</p>♦<p>In order to assess the amount of symmetry we compute the the so-called correlation asymmetry matrix. To do so, we take the raw correlation matrix, subtract it from its transpose, and compute the absolute values.</p><p>This results in the following triangular matrix:</p>♦<p>The way to read this matrix is: The higher the value, the higher the correlation asymmetry between the corresponding metrics across chains, i.e. Metric I in Blockchain A correlates with Metric II in Blockchain B, but the opposite is not the case: Metric I in Blockchain B does not correlate with Metric II in Blockchain A.</p><p>Specifically, the above asymmetry of BTC-LTC on–chain metrics shows the biggest asymmetry with respect to fee metrics, with the largest being between</p><ul><li>the total fee volume and</li><li>the number of sending addresses.</li></ul><p>Concretely, this means is that if the fees in one chain increase, the number of sending addresses in the other chain increases as well — but this correlation is uni-directional/asymmetric.</p><p>Hence, the obvious hypothesis here is:</p><p>If it becomes too expensive to send bitcoins over the network, the activity in the Litecoin network increases.</p><p>The reverse however not being true: An increase in Litecoin fees does not correlate with an increase of Bitcoin activity.</p><p>In order to test this hypothesis, we dug deeper and took a look at total fees and transaction count (as a proxy for network activity) in both networks.</p><p>The following graph displays the relationship between those two metrics in both directions:</p><ul><li>BTC transaction fees vs LTC transaction count, and</li><li>LTC transaction fees vs BTC transaction count.</li></ul><p>We again used the delta instead of absolute values in order to account for trends in the data.</p>♦<p>An asymmetry becomes visually apparent: Both scatter plots are substantially different. While the number of BTC transactions seems to behave independently of LTC fees (right plot), the opposite is not true (left plot). And this visual observation is backed by the corresponding numbers:</p><ul><li>Correlation coefficient of BTC fees vs LTC transactions (left plot): 0.64</li><li>Correlation coefficient of LTC fees vs BTC transactions (right plot): 0.09</li></ul><p>Visualising the above data on a symlog scale makes this asymmetry even more clear, and highlights a much stronger linear relationship between Bitcoin transaction fees and LTC transaction counts (left plot below). Note that over 63% of datapoints are located in the lower-left and upper-right quadrants.</p>♦What about Ethereum?<p>Is this a phenomenon specific to the comparison of Bitcoin and Litecoin? How do these effects look like when compared to on–chain metrics in the Ethereum network?</p><p>In the following we illustrate the above computed correlation asymmetry matrices, this time for BTC-ETH and LTC-ETH.</p>♦<p>The first observation from these graphs is that the asymmetric correlation between Bitcoin and Ethereum in the left plot is substantially lower (at most moderately correlated) as compared to our BTC-LTC matrix above, suggesting that it is in particular Litecoin that shows increased activity when Bitcoin transactions become too expensive. Ethereum in contrast, seems to be much less affected by this phenomenon.</p><p>Importantly the LTC-ETH correlation asymmetry matrix (right plot) shows no real asymmetries (all values are close to zero). This serves as a baseline and suggests that the above observed asymmetry effect for BTC-LTC is a phenomenon particularly driven by the Bitcoin network and not a mere result of the global crypto market patterns.</p><p>In summary, the differences in asymmetries of on–chain metric correlations are visualised below by taking the mean over correlation asymmetry values across each metric for each asset pair investigated here, clearly showing the strongest correlation asymmetries between Bitcoin and Litecoin metrics.</p>♦Conclusion<p>Analyses of on–chain data across blockchains can serve to shed light and understand the usage of crypto networks, not only in isolation but cross-chain, as interconnected components in the digital assets ecosystem.</p><p>In particular, our analyses show substantial correlations between on–chain metrics across multiple blockchains. Interestingly, many of these correlations are asymmetric, meaning that if you swap the metrics in the investigated metric pair between chains, the correlation vanishes. In the investigated networks, these asymmetries are most prominent between Bitcoin and Litecoin.</p><p>Notably, the data suggests that there are significant increases in Litecoin network activity when Bitcoin transaction fees rise. In order to be able to move funds faster and cheaper, users could be switching to the Litecoin network whenever the Bitcoin network congests and sending bitcoins becomes too expensive.</p><p>All analyses in this article were done using data from Glassnode Studio.

  ♦Priti Sushil Patel, British Secretary of State for the Home Department<p>Priti Patel’s position and newly published plans for regulating encryption at the behest of the “Five Eyes” are misguided and betray a fundamentally computer illiterate approach. She is ignorant of the history of computing and encryption, and her plans will damage Britain. It is a lie to claim people are put at risk by encryption; the complete opposite is true.</p>The Background and Facts<p>Priti Patel, like all politicians, knows next to nothing about computers and software. In her busy world, computers are the tools of secretaries and assistants, and not something she has a particular interest in.</p><p>Professionals in the Security Services on the other hand do understand computers, and are asking for software to be crippled so that no communication can be transmitted in private. They know the complete history of encryption, and how previous attempts to have it outlawed or weakened have failed. They are hijacking the mass hysteria over terrorism to make a fresh attempt to take encryption away from the public.</p><p>The Electronic Communications Act 2000 in the UK was an early attempt to make it illegal to sell a software product that did not have a back door for government access. It was defeated and removed from the statutes.</p><p>In the USA, several attempts have been made to mandate government access to all private communications; some via new hardware devices like the Clipper Chip, and others through setting legal precedent. They also tried to chill the release of encryption tools by the three year harassment of Phillip Zimmerman, the author of “Pretty Good Privacy”, the tool that Edward Snowden has admitted that the NSA and GCHQ cannot break.</p><p>Even today, any encryption system with key lengths longer than 64bits must be approved by the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security before they can be exported. This is patently absurd, since key lengths of 4095bits are available to everyone globally without restriction, and all SSL is 128bits by default at a minimum world-wide.</p>The Current Situation<p>Today, Apple and Google with their iOS and Android operating systems have rolled out full device encryption so that no one can read the contents of a user’s phone. This was done in direct response to the NSA’s mass intrusion into the communications and devices of millions of innocent people.</p><p>Now Priti Patel, under pressure from surveillance “professionals” in “The Five Eyes” who are exploiting her computer illiteracy, are trying once again to revive their decades old attempts to cripple the public’s access to encryption and privacy. They failed in the late 1990s and they will fail again, because the iPhone saturated, “selfie” taking WhatsApp world is a very different place today.</p><p>Everyone uses encryption, whether they know it or not, on a daily basis. All eCommerce depends on it. If the UK Parliament makes it law that all encryption must have a back door, then criminals will have default access to all websites that sell anything, together with easy access to the personal information of billions of net users on all devices. Her demands are unworkable and ineffective because different jurisdictions will not follow her, and any software developer in the world can use both the old and new absolutely reliable tools to have secure chat and email and file storage, or simply move their services to a free jurisdiction, avoiding the anti-tech British laws.</p><p>Furthermore, it is now demonstrated that if exploits to break into people’s phones are developed, they absolutely will escape control of the State and be used by bad actors on a global scale. We now know that this has actually happened in real life, thanks to Wikileaks. Asking WhatsApp and apple to build back doors into their apps is a recipe for disaster globally at worst, and it means Britain being cut off from WhatsApp and other apps at best.</p><p>Rudd can demand that encryption has back doors in Britain, but she cannot demand that Americans or anyone else follow her. This would mean that only British web sites and services are vulnerable; the entire British internet would be globally recognised as an unsafe zone for e-commerce. It would be a disaster for the tech sector of the UK that the government is so keen to promote.</p>Mixed Messages<p>The messages coming out of the government are not coherent, and its clear that Priti Patel is nothing more than the unhappy latest messenger. On the one hand, her government wants “Silicon Roundabout” to be the centre of the tech explosion in Europe, but on the other hand, they are being told to cripple the key tool used in making that tech work. Clearly, this is the sound of two voices at odds with each other.</p>♦Silicon Roundabout in North London. The centre of the UK’s “Tech City”.<p>And its not only eCommerce that is threatened by the UK’s anti progress stance. There is a vast movement online to put all internet services no matter what they are behind HTTPS by default. Mandating that the government has backdoor access to every website accessed from Britain is literally impossible. It means fundamentally re-engineering the entire web, and no one is going to agree to this. If you access an American email service from the UK, like Gmail, the SSL will not be back doored, and the communications will be private. In the reverse direction, they will not be private. This means that no company will host their email services in the UK, and the money, brains and tech will flow outwards, away from the UK. This will be called “The Tech Drain”.</p><p>Now that the world depends on encryption for the movement of all of the money in circulation globally, it is not possible to weaken the tools that protect the movement of that money without destroying commerce itself. You cannot weaken the tools that protect everyone without giving blanket access to criminals. Priti Patel has been badly briefed, and she will be forced to back down, or give up any hope of Britain becoming a centre for global tech.</p>The Flawed Rationale<p>The public pretext for this new push to break global ecommerce is the recent spate of anomalous killings by “Jihadists”. Criminal events, especially the more horrifying ones, are always outliers and statistical anomalies. The vast majority of the world’s people never encounter this category of event, and their safety must always come first; that means strong encryption by default.</p>♦<p>Politicians are very accustomed to making trade-offs. In this case, we are trading off the absolute fact of trillions of dollars and billions of people who use eCommerce being kept safe against the remote possibility of detecting and perhaps preventing extremely rare crimes against a vanishingly small number of people, the number of which when combined globally is lower than the number of people who die from mundane causes.</p><p>And when we talk about protecting people, we do not only mean protecting their money. Every aspect of your life is shielded by encryption, including all the private matters that you send or receive through your internet connected devices. Encryption keeps your private information away from everyone but the intended recipients. The government is only one hostile adversary out of many trying to gain access to your communications, money, medical records and location.</p><p>Encryption is democratic; it keeps everyone safe equally.</p>The True Reality<p>The age of the Security Services being able to read everyone’s communications at will is essentially over. The coming of this day was inevitable from the moment that PGP and SSL were developed and released. The net benefit to society is the emergence of global eCommerce and the massive reduction in online crime as the bad guys are permanently locked out.</p><p>If Priti Patel’s advisers were serious about reducing terrorism, they would advise a different foreign policy, which is the root cause of the terrorist problems facing Britain.</p><p>For example, Libya, had it been left untouched, would have prevented the immigration crisis facing the EU. The consequences of bad policy are the root cause of Britain’s problems, not encryption, and breaking encryption for everyone will not solve them. In fact, it will cause a cascade of knock on effects and another class of unintended consequences that will effectively end Britain’s place as a centre of tech for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Priti Patel must push back hard against the voices that are using fallacious arguments to get new damaging laws passed. If she does not, Britain faces a collapse of its tech sector, as building products that are safe for consumers will be impossible in the UK. The world has changed; not even the Communist Chinese are suggesting that global standard encryption tools be back doored, and they are using all the same software that is used in the west to protect their websites and communications.</p><p>We should not have to go through this process again and again every time there is a media frenzy over a killing spree. Someone in Boris’ government must be hired for the sole purpose of bring sanity to their pronouncements on everything related to software. Perhaps its time for a return of the “MinTech” cabinet position, which should be held by a member of industry elected by the software industry, and not a layman. This should be done before another suicidal piece of legislation is enacted, that at the very least, will waste everyone’s time defending their business models against it, and at worse, trigger a “Tech Exodus”.</p><p>Send me Bitcoin, Priti won’t know...PROMISE!↴</p>♦♦<p>Priti Patel is Wrong About Encryption was originally published in The Startup on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  ♦<p>A funny thing happened today.</p><p>For quite a while, we’ve been battling with LinkedIn’s apparent refusal to allow referral tracking. We noticed that any Lickstats campaign link shared in the news feed would show up as a Direct source (utm_source=direct). But there was a single exception. If you included a link on your professional profile itself — for example, as your website or blog — the UTM parameters would be generated as expected.</p><p>Such was the trouble that we even published a guide to our Help Center last week laying out a strategy for tracking traffic from LinkedIn — in short, to use a unique channel-specific link.</p><p>Then today, just as we were finishing off a much deeper dive into exactly what you can and can’t share on LinkedIn, everything changed. Suddenly we couldn’t get the screenshots we needed for our exposé. utm_source=linkedin is now flooding our dashboard. Marketers, rejoice!</p>Why did LinkedIn referral tracking not work?<p>Even the blog of digital marketing stalwart Neil Patel lends an air of resignation to this apparent quirk of LinkedIn. In a post on using UTM parameters with social media, author Kristi Hines has given up on gaining meaningful referral insights from this channel:</p><blockquote>“Unfortunately, the only UTM trackable areas are on your professional profile. When it comes to the status updates, LinkedIn seems to strip UTM tags, regardless of whether you shorten your URLs or not.”</blockquote><p>But this isn’t quite true. LinkedIn doesn’t strip out any tags at all, but instead prevents the Referer HTTP header (containing the originating URL) from being passed along to a service like Lickstats in the first place. Contrast this with a service like Medium, which does literally strip out UTM parameters at the browser level but not before it gives services like Lickstats a window of opportunity to register them before they vanish.</p><p>The culprit is this little bit of code here: rel=noreferrer, included in the link element and circled in the screenshot below.</p>♦The structure of a LinkedIn link element before the code change.<p>So, what does this code mean?</p><p>rel stands for “link relation” and it’s used in HTML to indicate the relationship between two documents (or, for our purposes, the current page, LinkedIn, and the one being linked to, our blog on Medium).</p><p>noreferrer then prevents the originating page (LinkedIn) from passing what’s called a Referer: HTTP request header to the linked page. In layperson’s terms, this policy is a very strong one: since it prevents the browser sending the header itself, no information usually contained in this data structure is ever generated — most importantly, the originating page address.</p><p>For the curious, you can read more about the Referer: header here] and [Referrer Policies, such as noreferrer, here.</p>What changed?<p>It’s quite simple, really. LinkedIn appears to have pushed an update today that has removed this link relation, as demonstrated by the screenshot below:</p>♦rel=noreferrer is gone<p>We didn’t believe it at first. We tested in three of the main browsers: Firefox, Chrome and Safari. All worked.</p><p>The funny thing is that we were testing a specific link on LinkedIn at roughly the time this update was pushed.</p><p>From our logs, we can see this before the change:</p><p>&quot;source&quot;:&quot;direct&quot;,<br>&quot;createdOn&quot;:ISODate(&quot;2019-07-25T15:02:31.973Z&quot;),</p><p>this a little later from our LinkedIn company page:</p><p>&quot;referer&quot;:&quot;www.linkedin.com/company/9433396/&quot;,<br>&quot;source&quot;:&quot;linkedin&quot;,<br>&quot;createdOn&quot;:ISODate(&quot;2019-07-25T17:55:19.126Z&quot;),</p><p>and this from my personal LinkedIn feed:</p><p>&quot;referer&quot;:&quot;www.linkedin.com/feed/&quot;,<br>&quot;source&quot;:&quot;linkedin&quot;,<br>&quot;createdOn&quot;:ISODate(&quot;2019-07-25T17:56:50.972Z&quot;),</p><p>There are a couple of interesting points here.</p><p>First, we can see a time window in which the change was likely pushed live to the LinkedIn site (between 3:02pm and 5:55pm UTC time).</p><p>Second, this is an excellent demonstration of the data contained in a Referer: HTTP header, and why it’s important for marketers. Most obviously, utm_source has gone from direct to linkedin between the first and later examples. But we can also see the specific URL that generated the link traffic: our company LinkedIn profile in the second snippet, and my personal LinkedIn feed in the final one.</p>Shifting goal posts<p>This isn’t the first time the Referer: HTTP header has done a number on the minds of digital marketers trying to assess where their traffic originates from. A post we found by Mason Pelt from back in 2015 describes a similar problem with LinkedIn data that his clients had noticed. It was still caused by the Referer: header but for a slightly different reason — and it wasn’t LinkedIn’s fault. Back then, SSL certificates (which make the difference between unencrypted  and the more secure  URLs) still weren’t implemented quite as consistently as they are now. As it turns out, this header will never be passed from a secure HTTPS site to an insecure HTTP one. All they needed to do was implement an SSL certificate.</p><p>This space is changing constantly, so follow us to keep up with the latest. Lickstats is a campaign link management tool that automates the creation of your UTM parameters and puts them behind a convenient shortlink. And you can bet we’ll stay on top of all these quirks. Try it out today!</p><p>Lickstats</p>♦<p>LinkedIn reinstates referral tracking was originally published in Zane Pocock on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  ♦A future of personal and financial privacy might be closer and more realistic than you think.<p>The other day, I went to buy dog food at my local pet shop. I bought a large bag of dog food and some treats for my dog that claimed to be able to make her breath smell better. Toothbrush-shaped treats. I paid with my Chase Visa card and walked out of the store. A few minutes later, I happened to check Twitter and saw an advertisement pop up — for toothbrush-shaped dog treats. I thought: this was not an online purchase. I used nothing but my credit card. How did this happen?</p><p>The advertising was too specific to have been pulled from the geolocation of my phone, even though my iPhone was in my pocket and certainly knew that I was more or less at the location of a pet food store. If that was the case, then I could have been offered an advertisement for cat food, or normal dog food, or bird food, or any of the other hundreds of items on sale. But it was the toothbrush-shaped dog treats.</p>♦The offending tweet<p>Most likely, I was targeted with this advertising because one of the trusted third parties involved in my payment to the pet store knew not just that I bought something there — but that I made a very specific purchase for toothbrush-shaped dog treats.</p><p>My data was sold into the personal information markets, without asking me, and without an opportunity for me to share in the profit. Thanks to big data analysis, within minutes my purchase was locked into the growing system of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>So who leaked my data? Was the guilty party Pet Food Express? Chase? Visa? Most likely Chase — given that they have confirmed that they share information about consumer purchases with third parties — but we don’t need to know the exact answer to see the inherent and striking problem:</p><blockquote>Today’s digital payments are privacy holes.</blockquote><p>As a civil liberties advocate, I’ve racked my brain to figure out what solutions might exist to help us address this problem.</p><p>We know that financial surveillance won’t stop mutating at relatively harmless advertisements for us to buy more dog treats. We’ve seen what happens in dictatorships like China, where citizens gain “social credit” points for purchasing baby goods, or where they lose points for buying cigarettes, or get cut off from the money system altogether for smoking pot or criticizing the Communist Party.</p><blockquote>Our transactions say more about us than our words. The more your daily spend is micro-tracked, the more likely you are to face an Orwellian outcome. In this sense, the fight for private payments is a moral one.</blockquote><p>Even in democratic societies, there’s a robust debate unfolding as we speak with regard to the potential role of companies like Facebook as creators of corporate currencies. Some fear that Facebook would on-ramp hundreds of millions of people onto its payment platform Libra via existing social media accounts on WhatsApp or Instagram or Messenger, only to harvest the payment activity of users and steer them in certain behavioral directions, or even deplatform users and freeze their money for having certain political opinions.</p><p>As initially proposed, Libra’s corporate partners will spend $10 million for the right to own a validator node in the network and help process payments. You might think — wow, that’s a lot of money — for what? Well — beyond earning interest on the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars kept in Libra’s reserve — the “what” could be an unfettered look into a treasure trove of transaction data from wallet activity and in-app purchases.</p><blockquote>It’s clear that no matter where we live, to stop Big Brother we must begin to shrink our ever-expanding data profiles.</blockquote><p>The less “linked” information about us being disseminated and shared between companies and governments, the harder it is to surveil us, manipulate us, and control us.</p><p>Today across most of the world, you can still walk into a store and buy something with cash, giving you financial privacy. But cash is fading in use around the world. It’s estimated that only 8% of daily global transactions are done with paper or metal money, and that number is much lower in places like urban China or Scandinavia. Even in my local neighborhood in California, there are cafes which are going cashless, for safety concerns. By 2030, the number of people who can meaningfully use cash in their daily lives will decrease asymptotically to zero.</p>♦My local neighborhood cashless cafe<p>A cashless society is a surveillance society. Whether it’s with the government-controlled WeChat model or the corporate-controlled Libra model, your day-to-day activities would be tracked. But what if the future could be different? What if we could have the digital equivalent of cash?</p><blockquote>There is a possible future where we can transact with each other in increasingly advanced ways that still preserve our privacy — where we innovate rapidly while also preventing mass social engineering and surveillance.</blockquote><p>There is, today, a feasible and reasonable road map to a functional reality where you can buy things on Amazon, purchase bus or subway tickets, and subscribe to political magazines or podcasts without disclosing your identity.</p><p>What’s interesting is that many people — across partisan lines — want to preserve financial privacy and agree about the threat of the surveillance state. Most just don’t realize that the answer may already be here in the form of Bitcoin and Lightning.</p><blockquote>Bitcoin provides the essential monetary substrate for Lightning’s global private payment network.</blockquote><p>In this arrangement, Bitcoin operates as the source of value and security for private payments to function. Without Satoshi Nakamoto’s innovation of decentralized payment processing, I wouldn’t have much hope for private payments, as all financial intermediaries are security holes. But lo and behold, Bitcoin is now in its second decade, and you can today send value to anyone else on earth, as long as you both have internet access and a smartphone, without relying on third parties.</p><p>The challenge is that for Bitcoin to work, its creators and founding community had to make several trade-offs, choosing to prioritize security and decentralization and censorship-resistance and settlement guarantees over speed and privacy.</p><p>But the Lightning Network allows us to take Bitcoin — which is limited on its own to just a handful of global transactions per second and a public, only pseudonymous ledger — and massively upgrade its speed, privacy, and daily transaction volume.</p><p>Lightning payments are instant and onion routed, so that they are hard to trace, similar to (if not quite as private as) data flows in the Tor network. If the network keeps growing at its current pace and architecture, it very well may remain decentralized enough to prevent collusion and keep Lightning payments censorship-resistant. Because Lightning isn’t limited to a certain number of transactions per second, it could one day — in combination with ongoing technical upgrades on Bitcoin’s base layer — accommodate the billions of daily transactions necessary for our future planetary needs. And because it’s open source and permissionless, Lightning is available to anyone on earth, regardless of location or age or income or gender or ethnicity, a key factor as we consider a dystopian future where privacy may only be attainable by wealthy and expert individuals.</p><p>There are, of course, significant unknowns and potential downsides with Lightning. There is, for example, a scenario (outlined here) where it ends up being too expensive and difficult for users to directly interact with the network (read: run their own node) so they instead begin to rely on third parties for access, seriously compromising privacy and decentralization. At the same time, users may find controlling their own assets daunting or inconvenient, leading to similar compromises. In the early days, merchants may find settling their Lightning balances into fiat money difficult. And there are other private money projects, too, that may win out. Technologists are building Monero, ZCash, Grin, Beam, MobileCoin, and more, in a welcome competition to preserve the values of cash in the digital world. From a human rights activist’s view, the more innovation in the private payments space, the merrier.</p><blockquote>Either way, we can’t discount the possibility that Lightning — currently an obscure technology only known to a few — might end up going mainstream, creating the global payment network that we need to preserve privacy and human rights deep into the information age.</blockquote><p>Here’s how that might unfold.</p>2020<p>In 2019, it’s only possible to spend Lightning with boutique merchants or by using some to buy the equivalent of cash gift cards to spend at a selection of popular stores. But in 2020, Square adds Lightning capability to its popular Cash App, which already provided Bitcoin access for tens of millions of users. You can now use a popular app on your iPhone to buy things with Lightning, anywhere Square is accepted. Sure, the payment is at first likely linked to your Cash App and thus your bank account and identity, but Square will not necessarily know what you are buying, and the merchant will know less about you — a big improvement.</p>2021<p>Companies like Blockstream, Lightning Labs, and ACINQ continue to evolve Lightning’s infrastructure, offering users more stability, privacy, and usability and enabling new functionality in mobile apps. Big merchants start accepting Lightning through payment processors from open source wallets, not just ones from big brands. It’s too easy, fast, and cheap to ignore. Some merchants ditch centralized payment processors for Lightning not because they care about user privacy, but to a) avoid the traditional 2–3% credit card processing fee that they typically pay to Visa or Mastercard and b) get instant settlement, without having to wait the usual amount of hours or days for the money to arrive in their bank account. Lack of clarity on financial regulations like the “travel rule” and the lack of a de minimis tax exemption on transactions still slows mass adoption, but some companies see the big benefits of Lightning and spend time and resources winning over authorities. Consumer protection efforts, led by groups like Coin Center, begin to show that such regulations don’t apply to most Lightning transactions.</p>2022<p>Due to popular demand, companies like Amazon and Starbucks start directly accepting Lightning payments from users without needing to know anything about their real world identity. Due to Lightning’s security model, users treat it more like a “checking” account than a “savings” account and only keep relatively small amounts of money in their wallets. And so in part because Lightning payments are overwhelmingly small, merchants and payment processors begin to allow customers to use Lightning on their platforms without requiring identification, while still being in line with financial regulations. Individuals have been able to do peer-to-peer private (non-custodial) payments for years with technology provided by companies like Casa, but now, in a big win for privacy, we finally see mainstream merchant adoption. Regulators clarify that running a Lightning node does not require a money transmission license, encouraging more companies to enter the space. Identity link is still required for Lightning payments over a certain amount (and for merchants such as gun stores and pharmacies) but this is seen as a reasonable compromise.</p>2025<p>Millions of younger Americans are using Lightning-based apps in the same way they once used Venmo. Except, they aren’t leaking their personal information anymore. Online social media platforms and advertisers change their models. They don’t have the same granular understanding of our digital footprints as they did five years earlier. You don’t get hit with advertisements 20 seconds after you leave a store or make an online purchase, since companies can’t link your Lightning payment with the rest of your payment history. Adoption by the gaming and fantasy sports sectors drives Lightning adoption forward massively, as markets in Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe catch on. By this point, all major financial companies offer or are experimenting with Lightning services.</p>2030<p>Due to widespread global use, the once-formidable legal and technical obstacles to Lightning payments fade away. The “scalable off-chain instant Bitcoin payment network” first outlined in a 2016 whitepaper has come a long way.</p><blockquote>It’s now possible to send Bitcoin — unlinked to your identity — to an open-source, non-custodial Lightning wallet and buy just about anything from any retail merchant immediately, maximally protecting your privacy while still abiding by financial rules. Small daily payments are virtually anonymous again, just like in the days of cash.</blockquote><p>Catching the “bad guys” is just as easy (or as hard) as it was a decade earlier, as merchants must inform the government about Lightning transactions over $2,500, and users must disclose some aspect of their identity for those purchases in order to get the payment to go through. Very large payments (tuition, real estate, cars, loans, and expensive goods) are typically done through base-layer Bitcoin or through fiat money, and remain traceable.</p><p>Social media companies, of course, followed Facebook’s lead and launched their own currencies. Some still exist and are used heavily. But none turned out to be as fast or easy to use (and certainly not as globally compatible or permissionless) as Lightning. Some of the biggest social media companies end up ditching their own mobile payment currencies for Lightning-based solutions.</p><p>The borderless nature of Lightning creates a financial revolution inasmuch as individuals can buy and sell things around the world instantly with extremely few restrictions and without needing to prove their identity. Old obstacles of currency conversion and bank account delays or freezes are left behind. “Banking the unbanked” becomes an anachronism, as the disenfranchised seize this new tool to connect and transact without permission from elites.</p><p>Lightning is still technically illegal in many countries — including China — but black markets are popular, and in most democracies, Lightning has become the evolutionary successor to paper and metal money, which has become a curiosity of an older age.</p><blockquote>In this new world, we only give merchants what they need. Merchants only take from us what they want. Advertisers have been forced to change their strategies.</blockquote><p>Tech visionaries like Jaron Lanier once spoke of a new internet where we could interact with each other in a peer-to-peer way, without being exploited and spied on. Lightning has brought us one step closer to this reality.</p><p>In the late 2010s, there was a lot of talk about “decentralized identity” — but this doesn’t matter as much anymore. Now that *you* control your micropayments and your interactions with voice-controlled devices and the ever-increasing internet of things, you don’t have a single clustered digital identity anymore. Companies don’t see you as they once did — as an easy and coherent data narrative to leak to advertisers — but only as obscured pieces of data, difficult to link together. Technologies like Microsoft’s ION decentralized identity platform help advance this trend, as users begin generating distinct and unconnected identities for different kinds of daily payments — coffee and food, payments with friends, travel, work, etc.</p><p>You of course still have an physical address, and a phone number, but they aren’t meaningfully connected to your day-to-day payments. Few people have goods shipped directly to their homes — as this is a major privacy concern — rather, they pick them up at community lock boxes, similar to Amazon’s lockers today.</p><p>Wearables and voice assistants and implants have exploded in popularity, but zero knowledge encryption has made it possible for people to begin to store private data locally on their devices, and individuals share only what they choose to share with the data markets. Of course, most people sell quite a bit to the data markets — but they can conduct business via their Lightning account, and don’t have to disclose their full spectrum of personal information like they once did without even thinking.</p><p>Lightning has revolutionized gaming and social media. Individuals are able to use the network to make streaming micropayments to each other. The best video game players in the world make money in a flow over time. As do the best podcasters and musicians. We consume media and articles on an à la carte basis, paying tiny amounts via our Lightning accounts. Government agencies and corporate HR departments eventually catch on, and they offer an option for you to receive your salary or welfare in small increments every minute, rather than one big chunk every two weeks, reducing the stress on the average blue collar worker or unemployed citizen.</p><p>In-person shopping is more convenient than it even was in the cash era, as payments are made with a quick tap or scan, and the merchants get the funds immediately. Fraud and refunds are still retail problems as they are today, but insurance companies have changed their business model to accommodate the new system.</p><p>From a human rights perspective, protest has gotten a little bit easier. Especially in democracies, where it’s possible to use Lightning (combined with facial recognition-deterring masks) to buy public transportation tickets and SIM cards, so that citizens can organize and protest without being easily spied on. Tactics of buying burner public transit tickets and SIM cards that cash once made possible in places like Hong Kong are still usable, even in a much more digital world.</p><p>Crime rates are similar to historical rates from earlier decades when everyday transactions were strictly cash. Despite what governments once said, there isn’t, all of a sudden, more child porn and more human trafficking and more terrorism, as these activities are still illegal and law enforcement remains effective.</p><blockquote>The idea that you have to give up your rights and privacy for security turns out to be a lie and a myth.</blockquote><p>Satellite and mesh networking infrastructure — first launched by companies like Blockstream and GoTenna more than a decade earlier —is now widespread, with internet access essentially being decentralized and Lightning users having many options to choose from when they want to connect and transact. Innovation has shrunk the old satellite dish down to something about the size of a USB stick and far more powerful and cheap, allowing anyone to send and receive from anywhere.</p><p>Dictatorships continue to try to crack down on Bitcoin and Lightning, but local merchants are addicted to the cheap fees and ability to send money globally instantly. Ubiquitous satellite internet access and easy-to-use privacy tools make enforcing a ban on use very difficult. Better money turns out to be harder to kill.</p><p>Lightning is no panacea, but the dire threat of an omniscient, exploitative global surveillance state has receded, even as mobile payments and internet-of-things interactions have skyrocketed in volume and popularity. It was once said that technology favored tyranny, but as it turns out, decentralized technology favors freedom.</p><p>What seemed like a paradox became reality: a world with more privacy and human rights was actually a world that was also better for business and finance, with faster payments, no middlemen, and a more connected global population.</p><blockquote>Is this future too good to be true? Almost certainly.</blockquote><blockquote>But what do we have to lose by trying to build it?</blockquote><p>This is the moral case for Lightning, a global private payment network.</p>♦

You’ve probably assumed this is a way to keep track of where website clicks originate from. And you&#39;re right, although there&#39;s more to it than this most obvious use case.</p><p>In this post we explore the primary ways that UTM parameters are used, what each parameter represents and how we’ve used these foundations to build Lickstats.</p>What do the five UTM parameters mean?<p>UTM stands for Urchin Tracking Module, named as such having been developed by a company called Urchin, later acquired by Google and rolled into Google Analytics.</p><p>There are five UTM parameters in all and when they are affixed to the end of a URL they are incredibly helpful for marketers to track the performance of their digital marketing campaigns.</p><p>For example, here is the result of a Lickstats campaign link with the UTM parameters it reveals upon being clicked:</p><p>Lickstats campaign link: lickst.at/what-are-segments/lnkd</p><p>Full unpacked URL: lickstats.com/help-center/what-are-segments-and-how-do-you-manage-them?utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=lickstats&amp;utm_campaign=what-are-segments&amp;utm_term=lnkd&amp;utm_content=5d3887bc955d8e676a6278aa</p><p>All five UTM parameters are automatically generated by a Lickstats campaign link. Here’s what they mean and how we use them in Lickstats:</p>1. utm_source<p>e.g. utm_source=direct</p><p>At risk of stating the obvious, this one is your starting point and tells you what site sent the traffic to you.</p><p>But beware: this is not as fool-proof as it seems. The example above is a link that we posted to LinkedIn. As you can see, the referral data has been stripped out by LinkedIn and utm_source is marked as a direct visit. This is another good reason to check out Lickstats: click here for our solution when sources strip out referral data.</p>♦utm_source visualized in Lickstats2. utm_medium<p>(e.g. utm_medium=lickstats)</p><p>Marketers use this parameter to identify what medium or type of link was used. For example, you might set this to utm_medium=email for email campaigns or utm_medium=cpc for paid cost-per-click ads.</p><p>By default, Lickstats will set this to utm_medium=lickstatsto help you identify traffic from Lickstats campaign links across all channels.</p>3. utm_campaign<p>(e.g. utm_campaign=what-are-segments)</p><p>As you’ve probably guessed, the campaign parameter is used to keep track of which particular marketing campaign originated the traffic. For example, you might have utm_campaign=summer-clearance to group and analyze traffic for your annual summer clearance sale.</p><p>In Lickstats, campaigns are the centerpiece of everything you do: all you need to do to get started is paste a link and type your campaign name and we sort out all the rest.</p>♦Each campaign link in Lickstats generates a corresponding utm_campaign parameter4. utm_term<p>(e.g. utm_term=lnkd)</p><p>This is typically used to identify keywords for paid search. For example, if you were running a shop where someone was looking for white shirts, this might say something like, utm_term=shirts+white.</p><p>In Lickstats, we use this parameter a little differently. We encourage users to create campaign segments to help them analyze experiments, and we use the utm_term parameter to append that segment’s corresponding metadata. In the example above, you can see that we have created a segment exclusively for campaign links posted to LinkedIn to get around the data stripping that happens on that platform. The segment term, lnkd, is tracked by the utm_term parameter.</p>♦Segment data isolated by Lickstats using the utm_term=lnkd parameter5. utm_content<p>(e.g. utm_content=5d3887bc...)</p><p>If you were building your UTM tags by hand, here you would identify what was specifically clicked. For example, if you were A/B testing whether people are more likely to click photos or text links, you’d change the parameters in those tests to utm_content=photolinkor utm_content=textlink.</p><p>This is employed a little differently by Lickstats, where utm_content is used to track confirmed clicks and, for our enterprise customers, to correlate Google Analytics attributions to those clicks. The string of seemingly random characters is set to the UID (unique identifier) of the click.</p>How are UTM parameters used?<p>In a nutshell, UTM parameters are used by affixing them to the end of a URL and configuring your Analytics software, such as Kissmetrics or Google Analytics, to recognize and segment your campaigns for you.</p><p>The idea here is that these campaign parameters allow you to analyze the overall efficacy of your digital marketing campaigns by isolating each source of traffic. For example, you might have a Winter Clearance campaign that has performed remarkably well, and good UTM tag management has shown you that CPC (cost per click) ads on a local magazine’s website generated much higher quality site visitors than Facebook ever does. You can not only adjust your campaign spend and efforts accordingly, but also A/B test under-performing assets with the utm_content or utm_term parameters.</p><p>The mechanism is deceivingly simple: when a user clicks your campaign link, the UTM parameters are sent to your analytics platform and populate both standard and custom reports that you have set up. Depending on the other tools you’re using, these parameters might also be used to calculate the navigation choices such a user makes once they reach your website, and they can be attributed to a user’s browser session until the campaign is over or the user clears trackers and cookies from their browser.</p><p>As helpful as these links are, they are typically fiddly and it requires saint-like patience to implement them properly. There is an entire profession popping up around UTM tags called “link management” — such is the demanding nature of coding them all by hand, managing them in spreadsheets and hooking them into your analytics suite. These professionals add UTM parameters to campaign URLs, generating what’s know as a “long link”. The magic of Lickstats is in automatically generating these long links and hiding them behind sophisticated shortlinks we call campaign links.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? Try Lickstats today!</p><p>Lickstats</p>♦<p>What are UTM parameters and why do you need them? was originally published in Zane Pocock on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Not too long ago, Bitcoin was a niche interest. Cryptographers,
cypherpunks, and some libertarian-minded folks were the only ones
interested in the idea of magic internet money.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today, and the U.S. President, the Treasury Secretary,
the Chairman of the Fed, members of Congress, and members of the House
of Representatives spoke publicly about Bitcoin — all in the course of
a couple of days.</p>

<p>We now live in a world where “there’s bitcoin, and then there’s
shitcoin” is immortalized in the congressional record, the Fed
recognizes Bitcoin as “an alternative to gold” and “a store of value,”
and at least one news anchor is full-on Bitcoin woke.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin continues to creep into public consciousness, more and more
people — politicians and news anchors included — have to ask
themselves some hard questions around money, control, and the difference
between Bitcoin and shitcoins. Government-issued or not.</p>

<p>The world is waking up to Bitcoin, and conversations which used to be confined
to #BitcoinTwitter are now had in the wider public. What a
glorious time to be alive.</p>



Understanding Bitcoin in 3 Stages

<p>Bitcoin is quite a complex beast, combining many disciplines in
non-trivial ways. Understanding what it does, how it works, and what the
implications are, takes a little while.</p>

<p>Many people dismiss Bitcoin at first. They might think it’s stupid,
arguing it can never work. They might think Bitcoin is inefficient,
convinced that some random shitcoin can solve the same problem more
efficiently. They might think it’s a fad, magic internet money which
will go away after a while.</p>

<p>After dismissing Bitcoin, angrily admitting that it is still a thing,
you might want to try to outlaw it. Especially if you are in or close to
the money printing business. The ban, of course, will prove to be
ineffective. Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, and banning it in your
jurisdiction will only hurt you, not Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Stage three is the realization that stopping Bitcoin is a herculean
task, bordering on the impossible. Killing a beast without any heads is
difficult enough. To make things even worse, this particular beast is
living in cyberspace, not bound to a single jurisdiction, feeding on
human greed, and getting stronger with every attack.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks showcased all three stages, happening all at
once in various public hearings and discussions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“I am not a fan of Bitcoin”</li>
  <li>“We have to outlaw Bitcoin”</li>
  <li>“You can’t kill Bitcoin”</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s examine those stages one-by-one.</p>

Stage 1: “I am not a fan of Bitcoin”

<p>On July 12, 2019, the most powerful orange man in the world decided to
tweet his opinion about the most powerful orange coin in the world to
his 62 million followers.</p>



  

  ♦

  




<p>What does this mean for Bitcoin? Apart from free publicity, not too
much. The orange honey badger still fails to care about politics and
thus the Bitcoin network will happily continue to produce blocks whether
it has presidential approval or not.</p>

<p>Since there is no bad publicity for Bitcoin, the only thing that might
happen is that a certain percentage of these 62 million followers —
some of which undoubtedly never heard of Bitcoin before — will start
to fall down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>One person which seems to have caught a mild case of the orange fever is
Joe Squawk, which brought us this insanely bullish segment as a reaction
to the Trump tweet.</p>



  

  ♦

  


  "You could sway him on cryptocurrencies?" "On Bitcoin."



<p>As mentioned above, the U.S. president wasn’t the only one commenting on
Bitcoin recently. The Chair of the Federal Reserve tried his best to
tell everyone that Bitcoin has no adoption, except for the fact that
people use it as a store of value, like gold.</p>



<p>Just in case you missed the important bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If a cryptocurrency system were to become prevalent throughout the globe,
would that diminish or remove the need for a reserve currency in the
traditional sense?” “Things like that are possible. But we really haven’t seen
them. We haven’t seen widespread adoption. I mean, Bitcoin is a good example.
Really almost no one uses Bitcoin for payments. They use it more as an
alternative to gold, really. It’s a store of value. It’s a speculative
store of value, like gold.”
<cite>Jerome H. Powell</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me rephrase the above, to get to the essence of what was said.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Question: If hyperbitcoinization would occur, would that make
the federal reserve obsolete?</li>
  <li>Answer, by the chairman of the Fed: Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright. Now that the danger Bitcoin poses to the powers that be is
properly understood, we can move on to the next stage of understanding
Bitcoin: trying to outlaw it.</p>

Stage 2: “We have to outlaw Bitcoin”

<p>A few weeks before the presidential tweet, a member of Congress urged to
introduce a bill to outlaw all cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>What would this mean for Bitcoin? Well, first of all, Bitcoin is bigger
than U.S. law, and second of all, laws aren’t very effective if they
can’t be enforced in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>However, after the introductory “we have to outlaw Bitcoin” speech, a
magical thing happened. It seems that this particular congressman
understands Bitcoin quite well since he made the case for Bitcoin better
than any maximalist could.</p>

<p>Watch below as Representative Chad Shillman beautifully explains
Bitcoin’s value proposition in less than one minute.</p>



<p>Once the value proposition is properly understood, the last stage is to
wrap your head around Bitcoin’s decentralized nature.</p>

Stage 3: “You can’t kill Bitcoin”

<p>One of the side-effects of grasping Bitcoin is having the humbling and
profound realization that it is virtually impossible to shut down. This
beast is bloody hard to kill, and once you realize this, you have two
options: (1) fight it and become a joke, (2) join it and become woke.</p>

<p>If you would’ve told me 6 months ago that a Bitcoin-woke news anchor
would interview a Bitcoin-woke politician on CNBC, I would have laughed
you out of the room. Yet, here we are, live on TV, with blue shirts and
colorful ties and all.</p>



<p>The point made by Rep. Patrick McHenry is worth reiterating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no capacity to kill Bitcoin. Even the Chinese with their
firewall and their extreme intervention in their society could not
kill Bitcoin. […] My point here is: You can’t kill Bitcoin.”
<cite>Rep. Patrick McHenry</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if this wasn’t bullish enough, the same politician goes on to
re-iterate the unstoppable nature of Bitcoin in his opening statement to
the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services.</p>



<p>Again, the opening statement made by Rep. Patrick McHenry is worth
reiterating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The reality is, whether Facebook is involved or not, change is here. Digital
currencies exist. Blockchain technology is real. And Facebook’s entry in this
new world is just confirmation, albeit at scale. The world that Satoshi
Nakamoto — author of the Bitcoin whitepaper — envisioned, and others are
building, is an unstoppable force. We should not attempt to deter this
innovation. And governments can not stop this innovation. And those that have
tried, have already failed.”
<cite>Rep. Patrick McHenry</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a moment to let that sink in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Governments can not stop this innovation.”</li>
  <li>“Bitcoin is an unstoppable force.”</li>
  <li>“You can’t kill Bitcoin.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Just three years ago, the above was only to be read in an obscure
paper written by the cryptographer Ralph Merkle. He argued that Bitcoin
is a new form of life, one that can’t be changed, can’t be argued with,
can’t be tampered with, can’t be corrupted, can’t be interrupted, and
can’t be stopped.</p>

<p>Three years later, and what was first articulated as a non-technical
metaphor to help convey the fascinating nature of Bitcoin is now par for
the course in the U.S. Congress and on TV.</p>



The Future is Bullish

<p>Bitcoin continues to win the hearts and minds of the people it touches.
This includes the hearts and minds of politicians, news anchors,
bankers, and others which are currently among the powerful and
influential.</p>

<p>If you would have told me that it would be possible to be even more
bullish than I was 6 months ago, I wouldn’t have believed you. Yet here
we are. Bitcoiners in Congress, Bitcoiners on TV, and the president of
the United States shitposting about Bitcoin. What a glorious time to be
alive.</p>

<p>The world is waking up to Bitcoin, and I’m more bullish than I’ve ever
been.</p>

  <p>Hi Matej, thanks for the response.</p><p>Regarding the lumberjack example, you are mostly repeating my point about capital accumulation. It is true that the lumberjack’s productivity increases with more advanced tools, that is the reason to produce the tools in the first place. However, when considering the entire production process, the production of advanced machinery clearly lengthens the process as a whole. If the improvement is to be effective in the long term, the production of the tools cannot be just a one time process but a continuous process of their production, and as such, we cannot remove it from our general consideration of the complete production process.</p><p>Regarding your second point, when government increases spending to substitute for a drop in demand, it necessarily increases current demand for certain things. This change in present demand is precisely part of my point in this article that a fall/ rise in present demand does not necessarily affect the expected future demand in the same way.<br>When you’re saying that government substitutes the current fall in demand, you’re exposing the issue it creates. That is, it increases present demand above its natural “real” levels, thus encouraging the allocation of resources to satisfy current government demand at the expense of further production of high order goods. Again, I want to emphasize that government intervention with current demand, does not in any way hints a rise in the expected future demand, as it merely affects current demand. In terms of this article, it has the same influence as regular consumer spending, which is an increase in the present, not future demand.</p><p>I intentionally didn’t discuss the business cycle theory in this article (where the discussion of interest rates manipulation is more appropriate) and was reluctant to discuss government intervention in general, as it would be out of the scope of this article.<br>These are very important concerns, which I hope to discuss in future articles (and were already addressed by many before), but in this article, I’m aiming at exploring the more general foundations of spending and savings as economic phenomenons. I don’t see how government intervention changes the underlying phenomena I discuss here, which is independent of those other considerations. Government intervention can significantly affect the economy, but what I discuss here is more general than that.</p><p>As for unemployment consideration in the case of an economic crisis, I find this also as a different subject than what this article discusses. In general, as I claim in this article, spending and savings as independent phenomenons shouldn’t change employment rates (for more than very temporarily adjustments), only the distribution of employment among the different economic sectors. Government intervention in the economy can and generally does influence employment rates (it is a different argument whatever those effects are positive or negative), but this is a particular case which is out of the scope of this specific article.</p>♦

  ♦<p>The foundations for the prominent economic theory supporting leading policies worldwide for the last few decades was laid down by the mathematician John Maynard Keynes. The ideas he pushed and promoted during his lifetime are still common among academics and policymakers, and his theory is almost exclusively the one used for economic education.</p><p>However, as was pointed out many times before, the theory he presented, when logically scrutinized, appears to be flawed in many aspects¹.</p><p>In this article, I’d like to focus on a claim popularized by this theory, which is that spending is the driver for economic growth, and logically prove that this, in fact, is contrary to the truth, which is that savings are the underlying implicit requirement for economic growth, whilst spending, especially when artificially increased, will promote economic stagnation. All this, by applying the integral concept of time, which is fundamentally ignored by the Keynesian school of thought.</p>Production and Time<p>As a fundamental axiom, it is required to acknowledge that all processes of production (the transformation of goods of higher order into goods of the first order²) take time, as if it wouldn’t take time at all there would be no transformation happening, and it would mean that no production took place. A production process may, for example, be a lumberjack cutting wood and using it for heating during the winter, or a baker baking a cake.</p><p>We can notice here that those production processes are usually only a part of a much longer process. With the baker having to produce (or purchase from someone who produced) the ingredients for the cake, like flour, which had a relatively long production process (parts of which are planting wheat seeds, harvesting the wheat, and milling it into flour).</p><p>We can also observe the correlation between economic development and the increasing length and complexity of production processes. For example, while in the past a lumberjack might use a relatively simple tool like an axe, a more modern tool is an electrical chainsaw, which requires a much longer and more complicated production process than an axe, as it needs components like a motor, an energy source, and various other parts.</p><p>I will use the following citation to express the point of time and production more formally. Individuals act in order to remove uneasiness by allocating scarce resources throughout time. There are means available, and one can utilize them in order to achieve some desired end. Action is purposeful behavior believed to solve problems. This necessarily must take place in time. There is an a priori value judgment of the possible ends to seek out, and following the action to employ the means necessary to succeed in the plan. Time is the concept that something has changed, and since action is change it therefore implies the passing of time³. “Time is scarce for man only because whichever ends he chooses to satisfy, there are others that must remain unsatisfied.”⁴</p>The Incentive for Production<p>We shall now start investigating the Keynesian theory of spending, focusing on its reasoning. The reason Keynesian theory provides for the claim that spending promotes economic growth is that higher spending means an increase in demand and because production is dependent on and stems from demand, the higher demand will encourage more production. It argues that without enough spending, there will be low demand, which will discourage people from production and cause an economic slowdown.</p><p>I want now to focus on the claim that demand is the incentive for production, as though it is generally correct, we can nonetheless observe a slight inaccuracy in that statement, which we will explore now. The demand for any specific good is a continually changing variable, influenced by many factors such as available supply, consumer’s taste, and population size. The demand for a good is by no means guaranteed, or even likely to stay constant during any period, due to the vast amount of possible changes which can impact it.</p><p>If we now think of the process of production, we showed that there must be some time passing from its initiation until a final product is produced. If we were to consider that production is indeed a response to demand, we must take into account that during this time when the production process takes place the demand may (and probably will) fluctuate. Thus, during a production process, “demand” could mean a range of possible demands (anything on the timeline between current demand and the expected future demand at the end of production), and for this reason, we must specify the exact point on this “demand timeline” to which we refer. It should be pretty clear that there are only two options which we can regard as non-arbitrary, the current demand and the expected future demand at the end of the process (the beginning and end of the timeline). If we now turn to consider which one of the two possible demands serves the basis for an entrepreneur’s decision to initiate production, we must take into account that at the time of the decision, the product is not yet ready to be sold or used, thus cannot satisfy the current demand for the final product. Since we cannot claim that a product (in this case, the unready product) is subjected to demand it cannot satisfy, we must reject current demand as the answer.</p><p>It is due to the fluctuation of demand during the time of production, that we must conclude that the decision to initiate the production process is based not on current demand, but rather on the future demand expected to exist after a certain period passed, namely the period between the beginning of the production and its end. Put differently, we can logically conclude that the production of all goods must be in response not to the current demand, but the expected future demand which the producer expects to exist at the end of the production process. From that, we can go back to the initial statement at the beginning of this section and rephrase it more accurately by saying that the future demand expected by the producer to exist at the end of a production process is the incentive for production.</p><p>For example, the farmer is planting wheat seeds today not because of the present demand for bread, but because he expects a certain level of demand for it at the end of the production process when he offers it in the market. While this expectation might be implicit, especially in an economy with such a progressive division of labor as today’s, it nonetheless exists. This must be the case, as, other things being equal, if the actual demand for the product at the end of the production will be lower than a certain level, the producer will lose money (or make a smaller profit than expected). So, if he didn’t expect the demand (even implicitly) to be higher than a certain level (that which below he loses money) at the end of the production process, he would not initiate the production process in the first place. The fact that the farmer did start the process means that, like any other producer, he must have some expectation for the future demand for the product when he initiates the production process.</p>The Path to Economic Development<p>Now, let’s take a small pause for a moment to focus on what “economic development” means. In simple terms, economic development (progress) is the improvement of the ability of people to satisfy their needs.</p><p>A probably unique trait of humans, to which we may attribute the most significant effect on economic progress is the production of goods of higher order (goods which are meant not to be consumed but instead used to produce consumable goods, goods of first order). The larger and more advanced the stock of goods of higher order available for people, the more they can produce and the better they will be able to satisfy their future needs.</p><p>Moreover, as mentioned before, we should note that the increase in the length of a complete production process, the number of different goods used in it and its overall complexity tends to rise along with the progress of civilization.</p><p>We can, therefore, state that a path to economic progress may require increasing the stock and variety of high order goods available for production, thus improving the production processes. Improving production will provide for an increased output of consumption goods in the future, which will allow people to satisfy their needs better.</p>Spending and Economic Growth<p>Now we can start analyzing the theory that spending incentivizes production and thus leads to economic growth. The problem with this theory is that, while compelling, it fails to address the time dimension in economics (in this case, accounting for future demand as well as present demand), which, when addressed adequately, leads to entirely different conclusions.</p><p>To believe spending leads to economic growth is to think that enhancement of the production capacity (mainly by the production of goods of higher order), which is the primary form of economic growth, is the result of the current demand, rather than the expected future demand for consumption goods. However, since we showed that producers rely on the expected future demand, not current demand when deciding to start a production process, we can say with certainty that this is not the case.</p><p>We can now conclude that economic development stems from the improvement and enlargement of production, which is driven by an expectation for future demand, and not by present demand. This conclusion indicates that the hypothesis that more spending leads to economic growth can’t be accurate, as it ignores the fact that current demand, is different from, and has different economic implications than the future expected demand.</p><p>We shall now try to understand then, according to the corrected statement, which is that spending leads to higher present demand, what are the implications of spending on economic growth.</p><p>Spending implies people’s preference to direct resources into the current production and distribution of consumption goods, which they can purchase and consume in the present. This preference for current consumption arises instead, and at the expense of preference for the production of goods of higher order.</p><p>The difference between those preferences is that while the former does not contribute towards economic growth, as consumption goods cannot be used for the production of future goods which will satisfy future demands, the latter could facilitate the improved production of future goods, which is the essence of economic growth. In other words, we can say that the former is a preference for the consumption and therefore depletion of existing resources, while the latter is a preference for the improved production of future goods, and thus for the greater satisfaction of future needs.</p><p>From the above, we can conclude that increased spending will cause the rise of current demand, which does not promote economic progress, but stagnation and depletion of resources.</p>Savings and Economic Growth<p>It is only appropriate now to explore what will promote economic development, and it is not surprising that the answer is the opposite of spending, which are savings. As the opposite of spending, savings were demonized by the Keynesian theorists as holding back potential spending (which according to their theory could be used to drive economic growth), reducing present demand (and prices as a result) and by that reducing the incentive to produce. However, as pointed out above, it is not current demand but future expected demand which incentivizes production, Therefore, we should reject this argument against savings, and investigate into its actual economic effects.</p><p>Savings signal a higher demand for future goods than a need for present goods (people save their money for future use). Thus, savings increase the expectation for future demand and, in accordance, incentivize production and promote the allocation of resources into the improvement of the production processes, namely, developing the production of goods of higher order.</p><p>In other words, savings represent the phenomena of people delaying their consumption and saving their money to use later. Saving money for future use means that the expectations for future demand should increase, which in turn will incentivize long term production and economic growth.</p><p>According to the analysis above, we can describe the economic difference between spending and savings as follows. Spending is the preference for the satisfaction of current demand, rather than of future demand, and will drive more resources to satisfy the former over the latter. While, on the other hand, savings are the preference for satisfying future demand, which means an increased future demand will be expected and thus more resources will be available for and directed to the development of production goods, which will allow for the satisfaction of the increased expected future demand for consumption.</p>Time Preference and Economic Growth<p>This concept of preferences for the time of consumption (from the present to the very distant future), which we discussed above, is what we call time preference⁵. Other things being equal, an economizing individual will always prefer a more immediate satisfaction of needs compared to the same satisfaction in a later time. Therefore, whenever individuals delay the satisfaction of their needs, they will do so only if the future satisfaction is expected to be higher than the immediately available satisfaction by a certain magnitude which they find sufficient to compensate for the delay. In other words, they necessarily price the delay in the satisfaction of their needs. This subjective valuation of the delay is what determines the degree of time preference, the lower the relative value assigned to present satisfaction, the lower the degree of time preference is, and vice versa.</p><p>We can define the preference for current consumption expressed by spending as a relatively high time preference, while the delay of consumption and the preference for a better provision for the future expressed by saving, we should define as relatively low time preference.</p><p>Since we know that the path towards higher forms of civilization inevitably requires lengthening the production periods, we can conclude that lowering time preference (our valuation of the present) means more willingness to plan for increasingly more distant future. Thus lower time preference will allow to improve production and promote economic growth.</p>Economic Implications<p>Before finishing, I’d like now to briefly elaborate on what implications the corrected theory discussed above has on the economy. Thomas Sowell has defined the central concern of economics as “the allocation of scarce resources which have alternative uses.”⁶ Labor, capital and other resources will inevitably be allocated in one way or another (unless prohibited by regulations), the only question is how and to which parts will people direct the allocation of those resources.</p><p>Spending will cause more resources to be allocated to the current and short term production of goods of lower order and by that shift resources away from the long term production processes of goods of a higher order. Savings, on the other hand, will do just the opposite, by lowering spending on consumption, less cash flow will be available for the sectors of the short term production and distribution of goods of lower order⁷, and thus more resources (and further investments from savings) will be available for the long term production processes. The increase in available resources will, as mentioned, be accompanied by the expectations for higher future demand induced by saving, which will further promote undertaking long term production processes.</p><p>With the latter case, we can see a trend towards growth and improvement, which will eventually lead to a more abundant supply of goods than in the former case. The result of this further abundance will be gradually decreasing prices for goods, allowing the enhanced provision of each individual’s needs. This enhancement in individual provision reduces the need for present-oriented behavior, as the satisfaction of present needs can be met more thoroughly, thus making them marginally less important, and will allow focusing on the further improvement of production.</p><p>The continuous process of reducing spending, which leads to more abundance of goods, which reduces prices and thus allows for higher consumption and the even further reduction of spending, without lowering (and potentially increasing) living standards, is what we call the process of civilization.</p><p>The conclusion I would like to draw from the above is simple, high spending encourages economic stagnation, while savings encourage improving production processes and thus promote economic development. It seems that the main flaw hiding behind the opposite theory developed by Keynes could be attributed to an “ignorance of time”⁸, which caused the confusion of current demand with the expected future demand. Time is an inseparable dimension of reality and must be rigorously applied in the formulation of economic theory.</p><p>[1]: For a rigorous critique on Keynesian Economics, see “The Critics of Keynesian Economics” by Henry Hazlitt. mises-media.s3.amazonaws.com/The%20Critics%20of%20Keynesian%20Economics\_3.pdf</p><p>[2]: For a simple explanation on the idea of orders of goods see: wiki.mises.org/wiki/Orders_of_goods</p><p>[3]: Hillebrand.

  <p>Brief introduction to the security, privacy, and freedom of your money.</p>♦Exchange rates of fiat currencies compared: (100,000 Venezuelan Bolivar for 1 USD) and (20,000 USD for 1 Bitcoin)What is financial self-sovereignty?<p>Imagine you have a gold coin in your hand, one of the simplest and purest forms of financial self-sovereignty. To hold that coin, you don’t need to agree to any Terms of Service or Privacy Policy, comply with any KYC or AML regulations, or show your ID or give your name or social security number. You just hold it in your hand, and you can use it to pay for anything by giving that coin to someone else to hold in their hand. It’s pure freedom.</p><p>In addition to the freedom of what you buy with your coin, nobody can magically know who you pay or what goods/services you buy with that gold coin, because your privacy isn’t being compromised with gold. And since you have your privacy, nobody can know about your transactions, and so nobody can decide to restrict or control what you use that gold coin to pay for.</p><p>For thousands of years, gold was the global standard of money. Everyone maintained their financial self-sovereignty, and the privacy and freedom of everyone’s money was respected. It was really that simple.</p>Why did we stop using the gold standard?<p>The current global banking and fiat currency system was implemented very slowly by bankers over the past 100+ years. They partnered with the world’s governments who confiscated everyone’s gold under threat of violence. For example, after the Federal Reserve Bank was established in USA in 1913, the USA government violently confiscated everyone’s gold coins in 1933, forcing everyone to use the new Federal Reserve central banks and bank note system.</p>♦“Deliver all your gold to our vaults in exchange for worthless paper, or we will use violence against you.”<p>Banks initially replaced the gold standard with paper receipts called gold certificates, but after enough time passed, the banks basically just stopped redeeming them for gold. The bank’s gold receipts (bank notes, or “cash”) were just worthless paper at that point, but because of the government’s threat of violence, everyone was forced to keep using Federal Reserve notes.</p><p>More recently, the banks now use a digital database, where they can literally create money out of nothing, without even having to print it on paper. They have solidified their full power to manipulate and inflate the global money supply, monitor everyone’s financial transactions, and control the flow of all fiat currency in their banking system. Banks control everything now.</p><p>Once the central bankers had successfully taken over control of the world’s money supply, together with everyone’s ability to freely transact and trade, the world collectively lost the security, freedom, and privacy of its money.</p>What’s wrong with fiat currency and central banks?<p>After the implementation of the current global banking and fiat currency system, the world was left with no other choice than to trust bankers and politicians to run the global financial system in a fair way.</p><blockquote>“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” — Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote><p>The history of the abuse of fiat currencies can be grouped into 3 categories:</p><ul><li>Security. Bad people stealing your money or your money’s value, sometimes in obvious ways, sometimes in sneaky ways.</li><li>Privacy. Bad people monitoring all your private financial transactions, and using your personal financial data against you.</li><li>Freedom. Bad people controlling how you can spend your own money, who you can transact with, how much you can spend, etc.</li></ul>How can people steal my money if it’s in a bank?<p>Here are a few examples:</p><ul><li>Theft by Inflation: This is the primary way banks steal your money, and one of the most sneaky. When central banks issue new money, either by printing it on worthless paper, or just adding an accounting entry in a database they control, they inflate the global money supply. Inflation steals buying power from everyone who holds some of that currency, simply because there is now more of that currency in circulation. Gold cannot be created, so bankers invented a paper money system instead.</li></ul>♦Banks can issue an infinite amount of fiat currency, either by printing or using a digital database.<ul><li>Theft by Seizure: This is one way governments can steal your money. Ever heard of Civil Forfeiture? If a police officer suspects your property was used in a crime, they can seize it, and you have to fight to try and get your stolen property back. Or, another example: Try entering a country with more than $10,000 USD in your pocket, not declaring it, and see what happens. It’s all the same: theft by other people with guns.</li></ul>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>Man who immigrated to the U.S. from Albania says U.S. agents seized his life savings at airport. t.co/RyoZzrpVA4</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@ABC</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<ul><li>Theft by Taxation: This is another way governments steal your money. I’m not arguing if taxation is ethical or not, I’m merely stating the fact that your government has the ability to force your bank to give them your money, and this is a security vulnerability. For money to be secure it must be unconfiscatable, and governments can confiscate your bank accounts.</li></ul>♦How do people use my financial data against me?<p>If you physically pass fiat currency to another person, in the form of paper money or coins, it’s relatively easy to protect the privacy of your transaction, just like using a gold coin would be.</p><p>However, if you’re using credit cards, debit cards, wire transfers, PayPal, Venmo, LINE Pay, WeChat Pay, or any other centrally controlled payment network, you’re actively consenting to waive the privacy of all of your private financial transaction data, and giving it all to a trusted third party.</p><p>When all the data and metadata of your financial transactions is logged in a central database, whoever has access to that database can use your data against you. Here are some basic examples:</p><ul><li>If you purchased high-risk lifestyle goods like cigarettes, your bank can tell your insurance company to raise your rates.</li><li>If you purchased something that is illegal, like recreational drugs, your bank can tell your government to prosecute you.</li></ul><p>But in the case of some oppressive governments, they’ve taken this to the extreme. They centrally collect all financial transactions, and other data of all its citizens, and have created a totalitarian Social Credit Score system:</p><p>How China Is Using Big Data to Create a Social Credit Score</p><p>George Orwell’s writings have already become a reality in China because of the central bank fiat currency system, and the payment networks that were built on top of it. If you think this won’t happen in your country, think again. It happens very slowly, but eventually all world governments will implement a Social Credit Score system, China was just the first to do it.</p>How do people control who I transact with?<p>In the first example with the gold coin, when you pass it to someone else as payment for goods or services, there is no centralized records of your payment transaction, and you have perfect privacy.</p><p>However, in the central banking system, since the bank has both the knowledge of your transaction data and the power to control your funds, they can evaluate against a set of rules to decide if they want to allow your transaction or deny it, as well as enforce that decision by controlling your funds. This is how governments have weaponized fiat currency and the central banking system as a System of Control upon its citizens.</p><p>To summarize: Because you have given up the security and privacy of your money, you have also lost your financial freedom.</p><blockquote>“Privacy isn’t about something to hide. Privacy is about something to protect.” — Edward Snowden</blockquote>How do we get back our financial self-sovereignty?<p>The Cypherpunk movement was started by individuals who understood the importance of protecting individual user’s privacy and freedom on the Internet. The Cypherpunks commonly believed that the problems described above could only be solved with a completely new money system, which respected and protected individual’s security, privacy, and freedom.</p><p>Many of the Cypherpunks attempted to build new ethical e-cash systems which could replace fiat currencies and central banking. There were many difficult computer science problems to overcome in creating such a truly decentralized system, and while some of them came very close, they all failed.</p><p>That is, until one pseudonymous Cypherpunk finally figured it out in 2008:</p>♦Combining digital signatures, a distributed ledger, and a peer-to-peer network, Bitcoin was born.How does Bitcoin work?<p>Just like how you don’t need to know how the Internet works to look at cat pictures on the Internet, understanding the technical complexities of how Bitcoin works under the hood is not necessary to use it and achieve your own financial self-sovereignty.</p><p>The important thing I want you to take away from this article is that while any new technology has a poor user-experience at first, Bitcoin is consciously and very intentionally not sacrificing any of its underlying philosophical principals to onboard new users faster, or to improve the user experience. The smartest Cypherpunks are working to improve the user experience. The technology will improve over time, just like it did for the Internet.</p>So then, Why Bitcoin?<p>I’ll tell you why:</p>Because Bitcoin respects individuals’ security, privacy, and freedom.How is Bitcoin better than the fiat currency system?<p>For starters, Bitcoin has No Terms of Service, No Privacy Policy, and No KYC/AML compliance regulations. Bitcoin is a successful implementation of crypto-anarchy where the only rules are cryptography, math, and a hard set of consensus rules. It is a distributed and trustless system, based on financial incentives, and no single person or centralized entity can control Bitcoin.</p><p>But most importantly, Bitcoin enables you to opt-out of the fiat currency and fractional reserve central banking system, by solving the core trust problems:</p>✅ Security against inflation by using a fixed supply<br> ✅ Security against seizure by using keys to control funds<br> ✅ Privacy of payments by using pseudonymous identities<br> ✅ Freedom against censorship by using a peer to peer networkHow does Bitcoin protect against Inflation?<p>One of the most critical consensus rules of Bitcoin is that there will only ever be a maximum of 21,000,000 Bitcoin ever created. After all the Bitcoin is issued, there can never be any new Bitcoin created. Therefore, Bitcoin is a deflationary currency, which prevents people from stealing your money or its value by inflating the money supply.</p>How does Bitcoin protect against Seizure?<p>Bitcoin can only be transferred by using the cryptographic private key which controls the funds. No government or bank or court order can seize funds. There is simply no way to enforce such a decree or order from any “authority”, as Bitcoin does not acknowledge any “authority” within its system. Bitcoin is a fully self-sovereign system, and because of its distributed nature, cannot be shut down. It exists on its own merits, purely because people believe in it.</p>How does Bitcoin protect Privacy?<p>Bitcoin doesn’t ask for your name or other personally identifiable details. Your identity is cryptographic, not real-world name based. So your identity looks like 1wizSAYSbuyXbt9d8JV8ytm5acqq2TorC and not like “John Smith”.</p><p>Additionally, nobody knows who controls the funds in a given Bitcoin address, and new technology is constantly being developed to improve Bitcoin Privacy.</p>How does Bitcoin protect against Censorship?<p>The peer-to-peer Bitcoin network is fully distributed. This means if one node attempts to censor your transaction, they will not succeed unless *every* node censors your transaction.</p>♦Centralization bad. Decentralization good.

  An Overview Of Mining Pool Exploits That BetterHash DisablesIntro<p>BetterHash is the working name for alternative mining protocols currently in development. When it’s completed there will need to be enough miners willing to switch to a new mining pool using these protocols, or an existing pool that is willing to service both the old and new protocols while miners gradually ready themselves to switch over. In either circumstance the initial switch will need to be supported by enough miners to make doing so profitable, else profit volatility would be too high. Ultimately miners will need to understand why they should switch, and there will need to be forward thinking pool operators who don’t want the control current pools have. This can only happen if the problems and risks with the current system are properly understood and conveyed.</p><p>Disclaimer: This is not a fork, or a consensus rule change.</p>So what exactly is wrong with Bitcoin mining now?<p>Bitcoin mining has a representation problem. Bitcoin mining pools are not Bitcoin miners, yet pools unduly signal for them. Pools run the node, construct the block, select the transactions, and can choose what fork all of their miner’s hashpower is used for. This creates a handful of incentive issues and enables some pretty undesirable political leverage. BetterHash aims to address this by giving those responsibilities back to the individual miners, and stripping the mining pools of their influence for the greater good of the network. With BetterHash miners would control their own hashpower, and pools would just coordinate them and distribute the rewards.</p>♦Mining pool hashpower distribution, versus Slush Pool’s miner distribution projected onto every pool.<p>This article aims to highlight the kinds of exploitation pools can conduct under the current mining environment — of which would not be possible if BetterHash-like protocols were adopted — at the expense of what may be the miner’s best interests. Pools can also be hacked and then used by the attacker to engage in this behavior. Before we get to that let’s briefly go over the structural differences between what exists now and what BetterHash protocols would change about it.</p><p>Currently, many miners don’t even run nodes and simply connect their ASICs to a mining pool using protocols like Stratum. The pool runs the node, selects the transactions, creates a block they would like mined, and then sends that block out to all of the miners using their pool and the miners begin hashing it. Once a miner successfully mines a block, it gets sent back to the pool and out to the Bitcoin network.</p><p>With BetterHash, miners will individually run their own nodes, select the transactions, create a block, and then mine it. The block would be configured to pay the pool, and just like with the Stratum protocol, those unsuccessful blocks (called “shares”) would be used by the miners to prove they’ve been mining for that pool the whole time.</p><p>By just changing who creates the block template to be mined to the individual miners, instead of the pool owner, and then building a new protocol around that concept, BetterHash circumvents all the issues we’re going to cover.</p><p>For a more technical overview on the BetterHash protocols currently in development, this presentation by Matt Corallo should suffice, but is not necessary to understand the exploits this article discusses because conceptually BetterHash is objectively better, and a fully codified implementation doesn’t need to exist in order to grasp how important this is.</p><p>It should be noted that the name “BetterHash” is not definitive, as mentioned in the video.</p>medium.com/media/9dbe51d0f061bf12575697c9429245df/hrefThe Status Quo<p>To understand why switching to BetterHash is so important, let’s unpack all the problems associated with the way things are now for miners that wouldn’t exist if they were using BetterHash.</p><p>To be brief, mining on your own has returns that are most likely too volatile, which is why pools have existed since as early as 2010. Critics will point at pool distributions to claim Bitcoin mining is centralized, and while counterarguments assert miners can just switch the pool they use, it’s not always that simple. If you’re a miner your options are limited to a handful of mining pools, each with their own terms of service that you may or may not agree with. Pools are too large to provide a diverse set of options to pick from.</p><p>At the end of the day you have no choice but to choose the pool best suited to you, and if most or all of the pools decide that some practice you don’t like or agree with is going to be the norm, then you have no real alternative but to deal with that, since starting your own pool probably won’t produce a steady enough income stream. Pools that already exist are relatively large, and by having many miners under each of their umbrellas, pools have the power over their miner’s hashpower to do a number of questionable things that we’ll go over one by one.</p>Pools can:<ul><li>Determine what transactions do or don’t go into a block</li><li>Be bribed to reorganize the blockchain under the right conditions</li><li>Backlog transaction mempools to inflate the fee rate</li><li>Direct hashpower without consent &amp; mine competitive forks</li><li>Dishonestly mine, should they have ulterior motives for doing so</li><li>Signal support for a proposal using a miner’s hashpower</li></ul><p>All of these issues are essentially the direct result of pools building the Bitcoin blocks instead of the miners, as mentioned earlier. Along with pool exploitation comes third-party exploitation of the pools. Pools can be hacked and then the hackers can potentially conduct these exploits, or pools can be attacked from a network level and then miners are left scrambling to figure things out or switch to another pool. With BetterHash a pool hack wouldn’t be able to control a miner’s hashpower, and network level attacks targeting a pool wouldn’t have a direct effect on the miners using that pool.</p><p>Network level attacks are just as concerning if not more than pools exploiting their miner’s hashpower. An attacker can bring down a large chunk of the hashpower or redirect it as they please. BGP attacks are easy to do and the time &amp; resources required to recover from them is concerning, to say the least. To convey how trivially an attacker can steal a pool’s hashrate and conduct any of the exploits written in this article, watch 3 minutes of this presentation below:</p>medium.com/media/b685415594b9f57bcf3fea015026e9c4/href<p>There’s no doubting the benefits of a protocol that defends against these kinds of issues, but solutions to often unheard of potentialities don’t always do a great job on their own conveying their necessity. I’d like to bring to light some hypothetical scenarios as well as some that have already occurred in some fashion, so that necessity is more readily understood. So let’s take a closer look at what each of them are. (Please note that some of these are hypothetical and unlikely to actually occur, and some require very specific circumstances, while others have occurred in one form or another already.)</p>1: Pools determine what transactions go into a block<p>Often an issue raised when discussing the possibility of 51% attacks, if enough pools can be convinced to blacklist a transaction type or an address, even temporarily, then it doesn’t matter if you — a miner — personally don’t care and would have included it. The motivation for this could be coercion or just a financial incentive to do so, whether the pool’s own, or a external one paid to the pool.</p>Scenario #1: Censoring a service’s hot-wallet<p>Imagine an exchange’s hot wallet being blacklisted by 40% of the pools, paid for by a competing exchange? It wouldn’t bar that wallet from transacting indefinitely, but it would noticeably slow down their transaction processing. As a miner, maybe you don’t think that behavior is healthy for the ecosystem, but maybe you just have no other choice since you have no say in what your pool does in secret.</p>Scenario #2: Censoring confidential transaction types♦“Maybe the developer was the same kind of lazy”, resulting in code that ignored shielded transactions.<p>The tweet above ended up proving — if we trust his word — this example to be non-malicious, but it’s still important to consider scenarios in which something like this was done intentionally. Bitcoin doesn’t have confidential transactions at the moment — and may never have them — but it does have different transaction types. If a pool had a reason for doing so, then they could theoretically ignore them so a backlog of specific kinds of transactions exacerbates, raising fees and potentially slowing down any service that makes use of those specific of transactions.</p><p>ZCash Shielded Transaction Censorship</p>2: Pools can be bribed to reorganize the blockchain<p>Similar to the examples above, pools can decide they don’t want a specific version of a transaction to be included in the ledger, and then try and act on this decision. Such a scenario would be next to impossible to coordinate spontaneously, or in hindsight, but if pools were so inclined then just a few of them could build software in preparation for a bribe, and then act on it immediately without miners having any say in the matter.</p><p>Miners might believe this is in their best interest if the bribe was shared with them, but pools have less of an incentive to do this the higher a share they give to the miners. Additionally, in a hacking scenario the hacker could counter the bribe to the pool, muddying the waters even more.</p><p>This was a suggestion after the exchange Binance was hacked — although the pools weren’t prepared for it — and many used this to make arguments about Bitcoin mining being centralized, when in reality it’s just the pools that have too much leverage over miners that this could even be potentially abused. For more nuance on this subject, give the podcast below a listen and make note that none of the things being discussed in it would matter if BetterHash was being used, because this would have been impossible to even consider if miners built the blocks instead of pools.</p>medium.com/media/580b7d287f0e63bb657db958e2595821/href3: Pools can backlog transactions to inflate the fee rate<p>Not only can pools bar specific transactions, they can choose to ignore all transactions below a specific fee rate, raising the costs for everyone trying to transact. Some consider this a trivial issue because smaller pools will take the opportunity to include those transactions since the reward for them is greater, rewarding the underdogs in the long-term. I don’t think it’s as trivial as this, since we’ve seen how the effects of this behavior can steer arguments in the political arena over rising fees in the short-term.</p><p>Sooner or later a fee market is going to exist, but throttling the network below its consensus enforced limitations shouldn’t be a tool granted to a handful of people running pools. While competition may exist at the pool level to counter this behavior, we continue to see empty blocks mined by select pools because the financial incentives are aligned, along with instances in the past where a few specific pools only had transactions that were above 5 satoshis/byte, even when there was room for the remainder of the transactions in the backlog. It might require some coordination among pools to have an effect, but if the incentives align then that coordination isn’t difficult or even necessary, and now a small group of pool operators would have a valuable tool at their disposal that nobody else has.</p><p>Pools can also do this covertly. Instead of creating “non-full” blocks, they can fill them with what looks like legitimate but unannounced transactions that they then collect back to themselves, to throw off people, businesses, and fee estimators by leading them to believe the new “going fee rate” is real. Once the market starts paying the higher price then pools could just adjust their malicious transactions up again. At the time of the image below, the bottom 50% of the TX backlog in size accounted for only ~7% of the reward miners collected in fees. The reward grew non-linearly with the median fee rate in the transaction backlog, making this a lucrative endeavor for any large enough pool wanting to try this out.</p>♦www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lwajx/spamming_the_network_unfortunately_doesnt_result/4: Pools can direct hashpower without consent<p>In more ways than one, pools choose what chain to extend. Pools feed the miners a block and effectively just say “mine this block”, the miners mine that block until it’s found by someone, then pools feed them the next block. Miners aren’t tracking different branches themselves, and miners generally assume that the pool is being honest and mining the coin/fork you expect them to mine. Many miners aren’t running nodes, so they aren’t validating the consensus rules. This has caused problems in the past when pools decided that they were also not going to validate blocks, but instead “SPV mine” on top of invalid blocks. As a miner you should want to know that your time and money isn’t being wasted by the pool you’re using.</p>A scenario:<p>You’re a miner, and you’re part of Pool_A. You receive a steady stream of payments for the amount of hashpower you provide to the pool. You’ve done the math, it checks out, and that never changes.</p><p>The operator of Pool_A decides they are going to use your hashpower to provide “life support” for another chain that’s at risk. One that you don’t care about and possibly dislike or consider to be competition. The pool continues to pay you “the market rate” for your SHA256 rigs, but your hashpower isn’t actually being used on the chain you think you’re mining.</p><p>Since there’s now an entire pool mining a different chain, the network’s block production rate slows down — decreasing rewards — and the market is potentially fooled into thinking there’s more support than there actually is for another chain — decreasing the potential value of your chain. As a miner, this is probably a scenario you would want to avoid. Unfortunately, this scenario has already happened in real life:</p>♦♦♦♦www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9y5qpj/roger_ver_calvin_if_you_happen_to_watch_this/e9yj4fy/?context=10000 www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9x2ekv/all_poolbitcoincom_hashrate_to_mine_abc_chain_for/e9ozqes/5: Pools can dishonestly mine using miner’s hashpower<p>Consider the scenario above to be the best case example of how this would play out: The pool is being honest with the miners about their intentions, and they are at least attempting to remedy what they think will be the financial burden. They’re giving the miners a heads up, and telling them if they don’t like it then leave — which is not always simple. But what if they were dishonest?</p>♦Allocated Hashpower is what a pool signals to the world, but not necessarily what miners intended to mine.<p>If a pool showed they were mining two chains, Yellow &amp; Green at 80% &amp; 20% respectively, and you were mining the Green chain through them, how would you know they were being honest that only 20% of their miners supported that chain? They could individually tell each miner that they are the 20% and they’re the only ones supporting it, when they really aren’t. Miners would have to coordinate on side channels and add up their hashpower to figure out if they’re being deceived. The main issue with that is many miners are private, and many want to remain private, will remain private, and should remain private. Coordinating like this is an impractical workaround to avoid being deceived and manipulated.</p><p>Not only would this sort of lie allow complete exploitation of all of the miner’s combined hashpower, but the disinformation could influence the market’s valuation of each chain. Anyone who values the long-term health of the Bitcoin network would want to avoid these kind of scenarios.</p>6: Pools can signal for a proposal using your hashpower<p>There doesn’t even need to be an actual chain-split for this kind of manipulation to take place. Since the pool gets to signal for all the hashpower under their umbrella prior to an actual fork, a situation like the one below would give the appearance that 80% of the hashpower is signaling for or against some proposal or fork. Given that signaling isn’t a financial commitment, there’s little risk involved in doing so. You would only need to persuade the few individuals running these pools to temporarily signal support if you wanted to try and move the market in your desired direction. If it fails — like we witnessed with NO2X — then it’s at no loss to the mining pools. Everyone’s hashpower still works regardless of the result.</p>♦Each column represents a pool. The top section of each column represents hashpower owned by that pool, while the bottom section is meant to represent the variety of other miners that use the pool.<p>No one knows exactly what percentage of hashpower all of the pools actually own versus how much belong to other miners using a pool, but the extra transparency is without a doubt a bonus for the — effectively — silent majority of the hashpower without a voice. Nobody wants another NO2X scenario, nor should a handful of pools be able to “decide” that the majority support something when they really don’t. Perhaps the NO2X movement wouldn’t have been necessary if BetterHash existed a few years ago.</p>♦Miners didn’t signal for Segwit2X, mining pools did.Conclusion: Perspective Matters<p>I anticipate there being two different common reactions from people upon reading this, both of which I&#39;ve already received from a handful of people reviewing it. I think it’s important to highlight this for the reader — you — and address it.</p><ol><li>“I didn’t know mining pools have so much power.”</li><li>“This can give the appearance that pools have more control than they really do.”</li></ol><p>Now for the “meta-considerations”, at first glance one might think:</p><blockquote>“The first person probably didn’t know much about mining or Bitcoin in general, and the second person has been around the block and understands the nuances enough to measure these scenarios more appropriately.”</blockquote><p>Another way one might view this would be:</p><blockquote>“The first person is providing a fresh and real perspective on learning about the balances of power in this system, while the second person has been around for a while and has gotten too comfortable and desensitized to the way things are and the potential threats.”</blockquote><p>Both of those initial reactions are valid. Both of these meta-considerations are valid. If pools had no potential to abuse the system the way it’s currently set up than there would be no drive to develop better protocols, and you wouldn’t be reading this. Conversely, if pools were such a significant threat to Bitcoin than they would have abused their power in irreparably damaging ways by now (see BCash).</p>Alternatively to these polarizing perspectives, this is what I’d like your takeaway to be instead:<p>BetterHash needs to be implemented, because BetterHash is objectively better than what we have now. Pool abuse and network attacks shouldn’t be possible, and we can alleviate these concerns by simply getting miners to run their own nodes so they can create their own blocks, and using a better pooling protocol structured around that simple but fundamental change. There’s always the potential that something could go seriously wrong if we don’t get ahead of a problem that we know how to fix, so let’s fix it.</p>Additional Resources<p>Bob McElrath: Decentralized Mining Pools for Bitcoin</p><p>Off Chain with Jimmy Song : How Mining Pools Work with Matt Corallo</p><p>What Bitcoin Did: Matt Corallo on How Bitcoin Works</p>Updates<p>1: Braiins, the company behind Slushpool, has announced the “Stratum V2” protocol:</p><p>Stratum V2 Could Overhaul Pooled Bitcoin Mining &quot; Bitcoin Magazine</p><p>2: Blockstream has announced their foray into the mining space, and are implementing BetterHash for their pool:</p><p>Announcing Blockstream Mining and Pool</p>♦<p>BetterHash: Decentralizing Bitcoin Mining With New Hashing Protocols was originally published in HackerNoon.com on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  ♦<p>I have some upsetting news to all the naysayers, doubters, and obituary writers: bitcoin has recovered from yet another supposedly catastrophic price collapse. Bitcoin is now 10 years old and graduated long ago from shady internet drug money to full blown asset class and savings vehicle. The trouble with bitcoin is that it’s complicated to grasp. It took me months to half-understand and is so multifaceted only a rare individual could claim to fully understand bitcoin.</p><p>I tried to boil down three years of learning into a handful of analogies for the curious bitcoin beginner. This article is written for pre-coiners, a word used to describe people who don’t own or use bitcoin yet. I attempt to answer the fleeting question millions of pre-coiners around the world keep asking: what exactly is bitcoin? Bitcoin is money, bitcoin is a land grab, bitcoin is a game, bitcoin works like email, and last but not least, bitcoin is a human right. If you can absorb these five definitions of bitcoin, I have confidence it won’t take long to shed your pre-coiner status. And don’t forget, you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin!</p>Bitcoin Is Money<p>Despite unprecedented levels of price volatility throughout its young life, bitcoin has strongly demonstrated its ability to be used as money around the world. No, you won’t necessarily be able to buy a house, car, or meal with bitcoin everywhere you go yet, but you can buy the most useful good of all: US Dollars. Robust markets to exchange bitcoin for Dollars, Euros, and Amazon gift cards are currently flourishing around the world. If you have a gold coin, you might not be able to buy dinner with it, but you’re certain to find somebody who will exchange it for dollars. Bitcoin works identically. Several million people around the world already own bitcoin in order to store wealth. They are the early adopters of bitcoin as a new form of money.</p>Bitcoin Is a Land Grab<p>There are only 57 million square miles of land on earth. Similarly, there will only be 21 million bitcoin. Mark Twain once said “buy land, they’re not making it anymore,” and bitcoin should be thought of in the same way. Bitcoin is scarce, just like the amount of land on earth. As more people move from the world of British Pounds, Japanese Yen, and US Dollars to bitcoin world, bitcoin land will only get more expensive and harder to find. People who don’t own bitcoin in the future will face the consequence of having to borrow bitcoin in order to use it, much like people that don’t own property renting from landlords. The land grab for bitcoin will continue because people, companies, and governments will realize they cannot afford to be bitcoin renters and not owners. Bitcoin’s price has risen over the long term because people are treating bitcoin like prime real estate. There is no single gatekeeper in bitcoin world, making every human being a potential property owner. Ownership will become more difficult and expensive as bitcoin world gets more crowded.</p>Bitcoin Is a Game<p>But how does it all work? If bitcoin isn’t backed by any government, who controls it? These questions can be answered with the analogy of bitcoin as a game. Every game has a set of rules all players must follow. Bitcoin’s rules were created in 2009 and are continually enforced by thousands of players every ten minutes on average (one of the rules). Bitcoin’s rules for money creation and value transfer have proven extremely reliable over the years which encourages more people to join the game. You can play the game by downloading software to your computer or phone. Nobody is asking you to learn all the rules to bitcoin today, but you must understand that there are rules just like any sport or video game.</p>Bitcoin Works Like Email<p>Everybody uses email. You might not understand the computer science behind how it works, but the simple concept of sending and receiving email is universally understood. Email addresses can be shared with anybody, but only the password holder can access received messages. Bitcoin works in a similar way. You can share your public address with anybody sending you money, but only with your password, called a private key, can you spend it. Bitcoin receives criticism for being difficult to use, but in reality, people just aren’t used to it yet. In the near future, understanding and usage of bitcoin will be as ubiquitous as the understanding and usage of email: send and receive.</p>Bitcoin Is a Human Right<p>Buying coffee with bitcoin in California isn’t revolutionary, but buying food with bitcoin in Venezuela to survive is. With a savings vehicle like bitcoin, every person in the world can now store money safe from seizure and censorship by corrupt governments. Bitcoin is an alternative form of money, one that people should have the right to choose for themselves. Billions of people today have access to send and receive information via the open internet. Tomorrow, billions of people will have access to send and receive value via the bitcoin network. Access to both should be considered basic human rights: if communicating on the internet is freedom of speech, bitcoin is freedom of speech money.</p>♦

  <p>there are no necessary or sufficient criteria for ‘money’. Anything that enhances the ability to create universal credit will do.</p>♦Photo by Fabian Blank, via Unsplash<p>Money</p><p>There is a common misunderstanding of Bitcoin as a ‘payment mechanism’, and hence that it somehow ought to capture all payments. I am not really sure, but I suspect this comes from a dogmatic application of the three essential characteristics of money as typically taught in macroeconomics 101: unit of account, store of value, and medium of exchange. I think this is rather silly and that, really, money is just universal credit. How it works or what extra characteristics it has is beside the point. The former attitude leads one to say things like: it’s too volatile, and, it’s too hard to trade with, and then immediately jump to, it can’t be money, while conveniently ignoring the multitude of other amazing and entirely novel things it can do: for example, it has a guaranteed inflation schedule that cannot be manipulated, transaction fees are either non-existent or regressive, it is totally agnostic to geography or identity, settlement time is rarely over one hour, it is completely transparent, it is a network that is never down and cannot be hacked, it is programmable (to a small degree — more on this later), and more. Better even than the abstraction of ‘money’, a less common but more intelligent approach is to treat Bitcoin as a better version of gold. After a century or so of relentless devaluation of previously gold backed fiat currency we are not used to thinking of the relevance of gold to money or finance. But its legacy is still imprinted on the banking system, and so it is with banks I will begin.</p><p>Before getting to the more exciting possibilities it is worth tackling head on why Bitcoin almost certainly can’t be used for payments all on its own. Bitcoin cannot handle the necessary throughput, by design: amending the block size or block confirmation time would be a trivial exercise and could solve this ‘problem’ instantly, but would make the blockchain itself unacceptably large as a data structure such that very few parties could run full nodes and authenticate the chain, reintroducing the centralisation that is essential to the social core of the enterprise to begin with. ‘Fixing’ Bitcoin by making it ‘scale’ would really break it altogether (which is why most copycats are entirely pointless)</p><p>How to scale Bitcoin (without changing a thing)</p><p>The implicit trade-off of foregoing practical payment applications may be overcome by second-layer protocols such as Lightning, further abstractions and generalisations as in the Polkadot network, or Bitcoin-backed assets, all of which I will discuss below, but not with Bitcoin itself. The constant furore over Bitcoin ‘failing to scale’ obscures a point that has been really been understood in the core Bitcoin community for almost its entire existence. Hal Finney, the legendary cryptographer and cypherpunk who was the second ever miner of Bitcoin and received its first transaction from Satoshi, gave what really ought to have been the final word on this in the Bitcoin forum in 2010:</p><p>“Actually there is a very good reason for Bitcoin-backed banks to exist, issuing their own digital currency, redeemable for Bitcoins. Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient. Likewise, the time needed for Bitcoin transactions to finalize will be impractical for medium to large value purchases.</p><p>Bitcoin backed banks will solve these problems. They can work like banks did before nationalisation of currency. Different banks can have different policies, some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve while others may be 100% Bitcoin backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash from some banks may trade at a discount to that from others.</p><p>George Selgin has worked out the theory of competitive free banking in detail, and he argues that such a system would be stable, inflation resistant and self-regulating.</p><p>I believe this will be the ultimate fate of Bitcoin, to be the “high-powered money” that serves as a reserve currency for banks that issue their own digital cash. Most Bitcoin transactions will occur between banks, to settle net transfers. Bitcoin transactions by private individuals will be as rare as … well, as Bitcoin based purchases are today.”</p><p>While I think Finney was mostly directionally correct, the picture will likely become far more complicated than what he imagined here, due to a combination of both higher ‘layers’ of Bitcoin and interoperability with other protocols, which I discuss below, and the possibility of integrating Bitcoin into FX markets to serve a range of business needs.</p><p>FX is a gigantic industry that isn’t necessarily cheap. Common pairs such as Dollar to Pound have very liquid markets and very tight spreads (for trade participants, but not even necessarily for consumers) but to consider an extreme example, moving Indonesian Rupiah into Peruvian Sol will likely be very expensive and may invalidate the business case behind the desired move. The more contrived the example, the longer it will take, also. Were both Bitcoin and a range of local fiat exchanges to be liquid enough, this would be far preferable for almost every FX transaction imaginable, possibly only excluding the interchange of Dollars, Pounds, Euros, and Yen. The reason is simple: it rarely takes more than one hour to transact Bitcoin, and is often more like 10–15 minutes. Also, the cost is utterly negligible compared to FX, and is actually regressive: miner fees (if they exist at all) are determined by how congested each block is with the data of individual transactions, which is unrelated to transaction value. And notice that volatility doesn’t matter either: only market liquidity does. Even Bitcoin is not volatile enough to create an exposure risk over the space of 15 minutes, and it will become less so the more it is used as a kind of meta-currency or settlement-commodity (or however else it helps to conceptualise it) rather than a speculative asset. What matters far more is that there are adequately liquid exchanges in the relevant currencies. If there are several markets between Bitcoin and the Dollar, and several more between Bitcoin and the Rupiah and the Sol, that are deep and liquid enough to prevent any arbitrage triangles emerging, then the problem should be solved. What would stymie this would be dramatically different exchange rates for Bitcoin in different exchanges such that value couldn’t really be transferred in the first place — but volatility is largely irrelevant.</p><p>This isn’t necessarily an argument in favour of Bitcoin appreciating, since the holding period I am stipulating is only as long as it takes to receive a transaction and flip it back to fiat. However, what would be really interesting is if an equally deep and liquid industry in Bitcoin futures developed, with the notional posted in fiat. What this would mean is that there would then be a use case to hold Bitcoin on the balance sheet of a company that expects to have to do a lot of FX trading or cross-border fiat settlement, especially that cannot be predicted with any precision. The likely volatility absent any futures would make this an extremely risky idea, but with a futures market, a company could maintain a float of Bitcoin that is fully hedged to their preferred fiat, so that the process of engaging in FX and settlement is sped up and cheapened even further. You would never need to rely on fiat exchanges potentially being inaccessible when you need them most; you tap directly into the Bitcoin network, and only return to the fiat exchange when convenient. Most excitingly of all, this market would probably make a lot more sense as part of a prediction market, itself based on another smart-contract platform blockchain, than it would if run out of an investment bank’s prop trading desk. We then come back to familiar questions of which system is more trustworthy, and how valuable it is to have a counterparty for legal reasons, etc.</p><p>On Prediction Markets and Blockchains</p>♦photo by Tim Evans, via Unsplash<p>Banking</p><p>The final tumble down the rabbit hole gets us to Bitcoin backed banks. (but if the rabbit hole is a fractal, is there ever a final tumble? anyway …) If you have a global settlement layer with highly liquid markets, then why not hold this asset in reserve and issue digital cash against it? Such digital cash might not even need to be blockchain-based, since you get the trust benefits from the Bitcoin the bank holds in reserve; you should be able to know the bank has adequate capital because you can check the blockchain, and you can redeem it whenever you like. Or maybe you can’t because you don’t have a demand deposit, but you can enter some kind of smart contract as to what exactly you can do with your savings and how you are rewarded for lending your capital. We get the blooming of a thousand flowers in banking experiments contrary to fractional reserve: entrepreneurs can actually try something different and see how the market reacts rather than just the occasional academic whining about it. Again, not predicting this will happen, just that it will be possible.</p><p>Bitcoin backed banks are worth pondering for a little longer, as both their risks and potential strike me as being widely misunderstood. Starting from first principles, there are two separate risks in running a bank, and most cryptonerds only seem to be concerned with one. A bank, as opposed to just a depository institution, is necessarily an asset manager that succeeds on the basis of directing capital towards profitable enterprise (this direction may be extremely indirect, but even mortgages rely on this happening somewhere in the monetary ecosystem) The risk managed by the reserve ratio is simply that the bank screws up the promises regarding liquidity made to the loaners of funds in the process of maturity transformation — in other words that they misjudge the true maturity of liabilities. The reserve is a buffer against that happening, but is a distinct concern from the risk of making bad loans — in other words that they misjudge the true quality of assets. Another conceptualisation of the difference is the risk of badly managing working capital as opposed to invested capital, or liquidity as opposed to solvency. You can take your pick.</p><p>The liability maturity risk is presumably greatly improved upon by Bitcoin due to its auditability. This seems to be well understood and has been interestingly explored. But the asset quality problem seems more pertinent to the concept of an entirely new kind of money and bank, whereas a lot of hardcore Bitcoiners seem to mistake the second risk for the first and misunderstand both risks in the brave new world. In a sense a wallet is a depository institution, so if you want to avoid illiquidity from the liability maturity risk, you can, which you can’t really do with regular money unless you hide it under your mattress. That’s one of the serious problems of being forced to live within an opaque and corrupt financial system; you are forced to shoulder that risk whether you want to or not, and of course the existence of ‘lenders of last resort’ makes it even worse.</p><p>In cryptoland, this problem is naturally avoided because the ‘money under the mattress’ situation is not weird at all. If anything, it is the natural state. But the fallacy here is assuming that the removal of the liability maturity risk via auditability immediately translates to the removal of the asset quality risk too, which it does not. If the bank makes enough bad loans (interestingly this quantum is determined by what it would take to wipe out the reserves, so the risks are related, just in a subtler way than is commonly understood) then it doesn’t matter how auditable everything is — the depositor is not getting anything back. It won’t matter whether it’s gold or Dollars or Bitcoin or magic internet money backed by gold or Dollars or Bitcoin or whatever. If it’s really a bank and not just a depository institution, and enough loans go bad, then the money is gone.</p><p>So that’s the risk, but there are opportunities too. To the best of my (admittedly limited) knowledge, the furthest this idea really gained traction was with the distinction between a checking and savings account, but even that difference is mostly trivialised by having money that is basically exclusively digital anyway. Regardless, you could have a structure whereby there are different classes of deposits, or perhaps the nature of the deposits depends on some parameter (the auditable reserve ratio being an obvious contender) It could also be the performance of the loans; you could get transparency on where exactly your funds have gone (or it’s a choice as a depositor as to what class of savings product you take) and both your access to the funds and your interest is somehow programmatic, or dynamic. Really, it could be whatever conceived of reason makes the bank function better, or more appealingly given different customer profiles. This seems to me to be the really intriguing part of Bitcoin backed banks.</p><p>For Bitcoin maximalists, this line of thought can even be framed in a way that implicitly mocks the more delusional CS types who have promised us the world with their ‘Bitcoin + X’ contrivances. What many of these amount to is just financial engineering via software engineering. More advanced, transparent, and democratic financial engineering than any investment bank ever provided, but financial engineering nonetheless. Whereas you need actual economic productivity for this to ever matter, for which sound money certainly helps. Keynes had a line that reflected this well,</p><p>“Of the maxims of orthodox finance, none, surely, is more anti-social than the fetish of liquidity, the doctrine that it is a positive virtue on the part of the investment institutions to concentrate their resources on the holding of ‘liquid’ securities. It forgets that there is no such thing as liquidity of investment for the community as a whole.”</p><p>Despite being highly questionable on economics, Keynes had a remarkable intuition for finance. Liquidity means nothing if the liquid asset doesn’t contribute to economic productivity over at least the term of the debt that financed it, and preferably much longer, which is something a system of Bitcoin-based banking might materially enhance …</p>♦Photo by Rafael Cerquiera, via Unsplash<p>Bitcoin</p><p>The core thesis behind these speculative ideas is that there are no necessary or sufficient criteria for ‘money’. As I alluded to above, anything that enhances the ability to create and circulate universal credit will do. There is no need for maximalism when we can observe what seems to work following countless independent experiments. If you wanted a slogan for this, how about, ‘unbundling money’, or ‘decentralising capital’? If the functions I suggest, or any others, come into existence, it will not be precisely because, Bitcoin is better money, but because Bitcoin introduces desirable and entirely novel features into the process of storing and transferring value, which can then be used to create credit. Bitcoin cannot transact instantly, cannot support more than around 7 transactions per second (averaged over the settlement period), cannot be reclaimed in cases of fraud, and can’t really be used to buy much stuff at all, at least currently. Fiat currency on existing payment rails can. But fiat currency (over any payments rails) cannot be sound money, cannot be guaranteed to always be online, cannot be transferred for free, cannot be programmed, cannot be audited, and if online cannot be permissionless. Bitcoin can.</p><p>With all this in mind, I will briefly cover two blockchain projects that have the potential to extend the capabilities of Bitcoin and, implicitly, any other robust public blockchain: The Lightning Network and The Polkadot Network. Bitcoin has almost certainly won the race to be sound money. Nothing truly ‘competes’ with it. But it also need not exist entirely on its own. Just as nobody gets excited bouncing packets around the network layer of the Internet, but really enjoys watching Netflix, Bitcoin will have truly succeeded when you have no idea you are using it. And so, the most important thing to take from this discussion is not an endorsement of Polkadot or Lightning specifically or exclusively, but to get the reader thinking about the broader concept of layered and interoperable protocols, of which there are - and will be - many. I only mention Lightning and Polkadot because I know the bare minimum about each to say something sensible. Apologies if it’s still questionable …</p><p>The Lightning Network is what has come to be known as a ‘layer 2’ protocol, in that it sits ‘on top of’ Bitcoin in a more or less metaphorical sense. I won’t go too far into the technical details here but what this means is that Lightning is a peer-to-peer network of Bitcoin transactors, whose transactions are not being recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain but which are subject to a cryptographic system enforcing eventual settlement in the blockchain. The goal of the project is to get around Bitcoin’s ‘scaling problems’ without corrupting the Bitcoin protocol itself. It is early days, but transactions on the Lightning network appear to be instant, basically free, and scale well with the size of the network. The networks runs on a rather ingenious incentive system that allows honest and cooperative parties to continue to transact off the blockchain indefinitely, but for dishonest parties to be punished by a financial loss that is settled on the blockchain immediately. Counterparty risk is completely removed by all parties staking collateral that they will programatically lose if they lie.</p><p>This may sound too good to be true, and in a sense, it is. There are two enormous caveats relating to any real-world application. The first is that the service is clearly only as useful as Bitcoin itself. In addition to the technical issues with scaling, another obvious reason people don’t regularly transact in Bitcoin (although some do) is the volatility of the price relative to fiat. Lightning solves the key technical problem with transacting in Bitcoin, but not the key financial problem. If anything, it might make it worse, as the second caveat is that involvement in the network requires placing some amount of Bitcoin in a kind of cryptographic custody — ideally slightly larger than the maximum expected net negative balance of the participant at any single moment during the period of participation. This both increases the exchange rate risk — which, recall from above, didn’t originally exist for many uses cases of Bitcoin as a currency proxy — and creates a potentially enormous working capital drain on any business wanting to implement this payments channel. Perhaps weirdly, it is not a zero-sum working capital drain across the economy; one participant’s accounts receivables are not another’s accounts payable. Everybody has accounts receivable from having sunk collateral into the Bitcoin blockchain to enable the incentive mechanism that prevents them from interacting with the network dishonestly. In summary then, nearly free and instant payments, but for a different kind of price.</p><p>Consider, however, that this price may very well be worth paying if it enables behaviour not previously possible. Who would want to transact for free? We don’t really know because it has never been possible to send less than around $10 without the fee being an exorbitant portion of the transaction. In mimicking tipping at the very least, online micropayment ecosystems could enable fairly large markets, or expand already large ones. Who would want to transact instantly? Visa allows between 40 and 60 thousand transactions per second. Bitcoin allows 7. Lightning allows billions. To ask a better question, then, who would want to transact billions of times per second? Machines. This is a whole other (probably fractal) rabbit hole that I will leave it to the reader to go down on their own if they so desire. But as Andrew Miller of the ZCash foundation put it,</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>InternetOfThings is when your toaster mines bitcoins to pay off its gambling debts to the fridge</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@socrates1024</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}♦The Fractal Rabbit Hole of Bitcoin. Great idea by Miles Suter. Not so great graphic design by me.<p>Who wants to transact instantly and for free? Well, the W3 Consortium abandoned an effort in the mid-90s to extend HTTP to enable Internet native payments — I wouldn’t be at all surprised if this is revived if or when Lightning proves it can scale.</p><p>Polkadot is an interchain protocol, among other things enabling interoperability between blockchains. They refer to this as a ‘heterogeneous multi-chain framework’, which intriguingly ought to work for blockchains of all kinds: public, private, whatever Libra is, or some new thing not yet invented. The obvious analogy is between intranets and the Internet, with Polkadot providing a kind of universal data transfer API (I’m not sure how wedded I am to this analogy, but for those familiar with it, Polkadot strikes me as very similar to Mulesoft, but open and public, rather than within an organisation, and for all manner of blockchains) The functioning of this communications layer abstracts away from the conceptualisation I put forward here of the transferable data on a blockchain constituting a balance exchanged for a computational service, to the idea of a ‘message’, which is a data transfer of any kind between blockchain nodes. This may or may not be a token transfer. Furthermore, the transfer may be between wallets (or contracts, or however they are stylised) on different blockchains. In fact, Polkadot encourages this. I mentioned above that Bitcoin is ‘programmable to a small degree’. It is not worth explaining exactly why or how this is the case — although actually the small degree to which it is the case is what lets Lightning work — but an exciting implication of Polkadot is that it really needn’t be at all; the programmability can exist somewhere else, on some other blockchain, and tied to Bitcoin via Polkadot.</p><p>The implication is that novel ideas around the utility of markets for scarce data need not come in the shape of endless fully formed decentralised computers that really only exist for one specific task. They can be far lighter, but if they require a store of value, they can tie in Bitcoin; if they need free and instant payments, they can tie in Lightning; if they need smart contract execution, they can tie in Ethereum, Tezos, EOS, etc. An analogy to cloud computing is apt. If you have an idea for an app, you may choose to let AWS deal with the infrastructure of storage and compute, within which you can run Kubernetes and Docker; you can let Stripe deal with payments, which you can implement directly, or perhaps go through Wix, in which case Stripe and AWS may well be working in the background; you can build your front-end store on Shopify, or maybe the whole thing, in which case Shopify will do all of the above for you, and so on and so forth, up and up the interlocking layers. The situation in cryptoland is not quite as generous, in that the services you need are not guaranteed to exist, or if they do exist, they are not guaranteed to be effective or robust. But Polkadot will hopefully at least let you utilise them extremely easily.</p><p>I find this particularly exciting for Bitcoin — and the idea of money and banking in general — because of what money means: universal credit. Almost any activity can be designed to have a monetary component, which is really only to say that people value the time devoted to their labour, while others value the product of that labour, very probably in the form of capital that will multiply their labour, and so on and so forth, up and up the interlocking layers. Therefore, Bitcoin — the most secure form of value settlement ever invented — and Lightning — which builds on top of this layer to provide free and instant transfer of that value — can potentially be used in combination with Polkadot to provide either a value-storage or payments functionality to any kind of wonderful, free and open source, new kind of computer, decentralised corporation that can be imagined:</p><p>The Conceptual Blockchain</p>♦Photo by Con Karampelas, via Unsplash<p>Libra</p><p>Of course, this all brings us to Libra. I have three main points to make in order to adequately compare Libra to money, banking, and Bitcoin. We might call them the good, the bad, and the ugly, although unfortunately I won’t treat them in that order. The bad is that the Libra data structure is a database, not a blockchain, and the Libra consortium is a hedge fund, not a network of nodes. The good is that Libra will acclimatise billions of people to digital bearer assets, and may be a force for great social good in the short run. The ugly is that it will be a force for great social evil in the long run.</p><p>That Libra is not a blockchain is really just a technicality, but it is worth disabusing anybody who has been fooled by clueless journalists. Libra is a distributed ledger that is an attempt to mashup the most palatable parts of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple, but none of the parts that make them truly revolutionary. It is very technically interesting, and if it works, it will be an incredible technical achievement, but it is not a blockchain. This matters for more than linguistic reasons; the Libra data structure may be open and may be private, but will definitely not be neutral or permissionless, and the tokens will not be sound. This wouldn’t be worth stressing so much if both the official and technical white papers didn’t constantly misuse the words ‘blockchain’ and ‘cryptocurrency’. After each of the following extracts, I provide a translation,</p>♦<p>“Libra is a permissioned database. We will think really hard about how to transition it to a permissionless database but unfortunately we don’t really like the only known way to do that.”</p><p>And,</p>♦<p>“There are some really difficult unsolved problems in the theoretical underpinnings of scaling open blockchains. We also don’t know how to solve them.”</p><p>And,</p>♦<p>“Just to be extra clear: the Libra blockchain is a database of validator-signed ledger states with a Merkle tree of the historical states - not a blockchain.”</p><p>Given Libra the data structure is not a blockchain, we must then wonder what the Libra consortium is, given it is clearly not a network of nodes. A collection of transaction validators is accurate enough, but a little dry. It is a lot more revealing to describe it as a hedge fund.</p><p>The way it looks like the Libra ‘token’ will come into existence will be in exchange for deposits from users. You will send the consortium fiat over existing payment rails, and they will mint some ‘Libra’ and give it to you, and you can cash in your Libra for fiat and they will ‘burn’ the fake money and return your fiat (the feature of having different names for the data structure and the tokens is not one of the better parts of other blockchains implemented here). The ‘nodes’ are really processing centres, in that they need to contribute a minimum of computing power to handle the transactions being submitted. It all sounds very communitarian until you realise that what is in it for them is interest on the deposits of real assets ‘backing’ the digital assets issued. In order to maintain price stability, these deposits will be invested in the government bonds of the fiat currencies against which Libra is desired to be stable.</p>medium.com/media/f5a87f00afaa2d504ddc58a753b8acf1/href<p>This is worth pondering as it is really quite incredible. Libra is going to have zero cost of capital on funds it will lend at the risk-free rate. Despite strictly speaking being total nonsense, the ‘risk-free rate’ ought to be the lowest rate it is possible to borrow at, hence governments borrowing at this rate and not an even lower one. Because Libra has an even lower borrowing cost (none), it can lend at the risk-free rate and earn an arbitrage profit on what will almost certainly be the largest pool of capital ever collected by a corporation. In the above vein of banking theory, it is worth considering that Libra will only need petty cash / liquidity / working capital / however you want to conceptualise it, of the most extreme net negative redemption of Libra to fiat, multiplied by the settlement period of government debt, which in most cases is one or two days. This will almost certainly be utterly trivial compared to the market valuation of minted Libra at most times, and given the intention to charge transaction fees, may actually be completely irrelevant since fees can be dynamically matched to real time outflows even while remaining miniscule. So Libra will be an almost artificially highly leveraged hedge fund. What’s more, it will be a perfectly safely leveraged one, because the assets will be both the highest quality in existence and perfectly liquid. Neither banking risk will exist. This is astonishing.</p><p>How it achieves this hedge fund like status is worth exploring because it is the source of both the great social good and great social evil that will likely follow — assuming it works, or is allowed to work. My hunch is it won’t be allowed to work at all, so I would take much of the juxtaposed utopianism and dystopianism below with a pinch of salt.</p><p>Every Libra bought will either represent a Dollar/Pound/Euro/Yen given to Libra and invested in government debt denominated in those currencies, in which case who cares, or it will be something else, in which case things get very interesting. A WhatsApp user will transfer their Indian Rupee, let’s say, to Libra in exchange for digital money. Libra will then sell Rupee for Dollar on the FX market to gain the fiat to back the Libra. This will cause the Rupee to depreciate relative to the Dollar/Pound/Euro/Yen, making it more difficult to raise capital in Rupee and easier in Dollars, making Libra even more viable as a medium of exchange, on top of the worldwide networked marketplace in which it is already exclusively accepted by fiat. The role Libra will be playing is the FX broker-dealer that ‘dollarizes’ emerging markets and immediately provides an economy in which the the hybrid Dollar/Pound/Euro/Yen can be spent.</p><p>This could initially be a great social good, for three reasons. Firstly, we should not underestimate the dramatic difference this could really make to the billions of unbanked around the world who can afford a phone but not a bank account — and the hundreds of millions more who have bank accounts that achieve nothing given their monetary wealth is consistently inflated away. Additionally, the smart contract elements of Libra could allow for programming of cross border business logic that would previously have been impossible due to combinations of illiquidity, inflation, and capital controls. Facebook’s rhetoric around empowerment, while suspicious to the point of hilarious given its coming from Facebook, is probably entirely accurate in this case. This could be tremendously beneficial to those living in monetary regimes that are inept, corrupt, or both.</p><p>Secondly, Libra is arguably a necessary experiment in the development of the banking of digital assets. It is a simple and natural step to first trial a digital asset backed by fiat that, however philosophically flawed, is actually used as money currently. There are fewer degrees of freedom than a bank of a novel digital money backed by Bitcoin, and yet the lessons learned will obviously be relevant, be they technical, economic, or social. This will be truer the more genuinely open Libra turns out to be, since the experiment will not be of the viability of Libra and banking of digital assets alone, but of every other open system that connects to it to incorporate Internet-native money, contracts, and so on. Libra will be psychologically safer to build on to begin with, but via the likes of Polkadot will open the door to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more.</p><p>But the third and most important reason is that in addition to developers and entrepreneurs, Libra will acclimatise billions of regular people to digital bearer assets. Minds.com founder Bill Ottman put it well in a recent interview, “it’s not Bitcoin, it’s not Ethereum, but maybe it’s a weird bridge? It’s a weird bridge which you don’t necessarily know whether or not it will collapse as you are walking over it.” The acclimatisation will be particularly important when the dream of dollarized digital money collapses into the nightmare of corporate neo-feudalism. Some readers may have winced at my positive invocation of ‘dollarization’, given its connotations of monetary imperialism. They would have been right to do so had they thought my enthusiasm was unequivocal. But notice I only ever said ‘could’, not ‘will’. This could be a great social good, but it will likely devolve into a great social evil. If you think the monetary imperialism of the United States of America is bad, wait until you see the monetary imperialism of a corporation that actually makes a profit.</p><p>If you believe that Facebook will never use your activity with Libra to better serve you ads, you are delusional. They won’t do it right away, for sure. They said so in the white paper. But there is absolutely nothing about this technology that enforces this promise. It’s a promise from this man:</p>♦n.b. this is real, not a joke or a fake. see here for more.<p>What is particularly perverse is that Facebook has a legal obligation to its shareholders to follow this path. The board of directors will be failing in their fiduciary responsibility if they do not encourage Mark Zuckerberg to direct Libra to behave in this way. Which, of course, he can. Libra is not an open, permissionless, neutral, private, sound money like Bitcoin. It is corporate money. It will work better than government money but it will turn out to be even more insidious. If you are actually adding value with your service relative to a useless competitor your customers previously had no choice but to use, you generate an enormous amount of goodwill you can later rapaciously exploit.</p><p>Which means there will be mass surveillance and data leaks. Even without leaks there will be deanonymization of the transactional graph. There will be purges, and censorship, and confiscations of wealth. Facebook will control enough economic activity to dictate monetary policy to economically weaker nations. This won’t be in the form of direct confrontation — it will be a system upgrade that optimises something or other that within a few days sees yet more value sucked into lowering the cost of funding the governments of the largest economies in the world — those that have meaningful power over Facebook, the corporation — and a few days after that the power of every other government to affect the economic goings on within their own borders. Shades of this may sound ideal and romantic, but this is not a stripping of the power to interfere with the activity of willing individuals — it is a transfer of that power to Silicon Valley.</p><p>Much of the above few paragraphs consist of the worst possible dystopian outcome. I seriously doubt anything like all of this will happen in its entirety, but there will come a point when it becomes obvious that it could happen. The steps to roll back Libra’s power to ensure that it doesn’t happen will not be pretty. And the fallout will see a great many disillusioned people turning to money that is open, permissionless, neutral, private, and sound.</p><p>Which is what we wanted all along.</p><p>Thanks to Nic Carter for help with editing, and Andreas M.

  New Views of a Classic On-Chain Metric<p>By Reginald Smith and David Puell</p><p>Disclaimer: Nothing here should be considered trading or investment advice.</p><p>So what is average dormancy (or simply, “dormancy”)? First proposed by this article’s co-author Reginald Smith in 2018, it has not been given enough attention relative to its importance as one of the foremost metrics of BTC’s long-term economic health. In summary, dormancy is the average number of days destroyed per coin transacted in any given day, as per the following formula:</p>♦<p>Here, destruction equals the total number of coindays destroyed, and volume equals the total number of coins transacted through the blockchain (and not at exchanges). This ratio describes the average number of days each coin transacted remained dormant, unmoved. The higher the dormancy, the older the coins transacted that day are on average, and the more old hands are releasing their bitcoins into circulation. In other words, average dormancy refers to spent or realized destruction relative to transactions.</p>♦Fearful Symmetry: Accumulation and Distribution<p>As pointed out in dormancy’s original paper, on-chain destruction and on-chain volume equate to being perhaps the two most important metrics of Bitcoin’s economic state; the reason being that, especially when compared as a ratio such as dormancy, they describe the state of what smart money is doing in the market at any given time—accumulation or distribution. Based on first principles, the following assumptions emerge:</p><ol><li>Accumulation describes the act of smart money (last-resort buyers) taking cheap coins from dumb money (panic sellers), while distribution describes the act of smart money (old hands) releasing expensive coins into the hands of dumb money (bag holders). Accumulation occurs at market bottoms and distribution occurs at market tops.</li><li>Destruction describes the actions of mostly a single market actor: old hands selling or spending their bitcoins. Volume describes the actions of two market actors: buyers and sellers dealing with investor flows at different prices.</li><li>High destruction is bearish (old smart holders releasing coins into circulation) and low destruction is neutral (since in itself it implies holders are maintaining their position but not necessarily that buyers are coming in). High volume in itself is neutral (high number of transactions between both buyers and sellers) and low volume is bearish (confirming no demand for the asset as per a lack of buyer’s activity). From the above, the following simplified matrix emerges:</li></ol>♦<p>Dormancy integrates all these narratives into a single metric, by comparing both ratio components at all times, and displaying them in a simple oscillation by which, on a trending basis, high dormancy is bearish and low dormancy is bullish.</p>Supply-Adjusted Dormancy<p>Since the age of the market allows for an ever-increasing amount of destruction (the numerator of average dormancy), adjusting for supply (an increasing creation of minted coins) in the denominator seems to provide a clearer, more proportional historical oscillation that helps best visually detect the health of the market — or, in this case, dormancy per coin, calculated as follows:</p>♦<p>This formula produces the chart below:</p>♦DUA Ratio (by Reginald Smith)<p>Just as with pure transaction volume and its variants like NVT Ratio, NVT Signal, or Network Momentum, the dormancy concept has opened the door into a new inflow of indicators for long-term Bitcoin market diagnostics. What follows are two examples of this.</p><p>Dormancy-to-UTXO-Age Ratio measures the relation between dormancy and the average age of all UTXOs at any given time, calculated by taking the ratio of average dormancy of the last 30 days between the average of all HODL waves in existance, as follows:</p>♦<p>In which median days represents the median time of the HODL wave age band, and wave percentage represents the percentage of UTXOs in any given age band. In this particular case, both coindays destroyed and on-chain volume are aggregated throughout 30 days to smooth out the dormancy numerator.</p><p>Since dormancy measures the average holding time of continuously on-chain trading Bitcoin, the average age of UTXO, which includes bitcoin both in the HODL and lost states, is always longer — so average dormancy is always less than the average age of UTXOs. Therefore, the ratio is always less than one.</p>♦<p>In periods where long-term holders accumulate (HODL) Bitcoin, the average dormancy is low and the average age of UTXO increases, lowering the ratio. When long-term holders offload their holdings to short-term traders, the average dormancy increases and the average age of UTXO decreases, raising the ratio. This tool is therefore useful in identifying market trends that often lead to HODL waves detecting periods of bitcoin selling by long-term holders in bull markets, and then re-accumulation after the onset of the bear market when the UTXO average age begins to rise and dormancy once again drops.</p>Dormancy Flow (by David Puell)<p>Another attempt at capturing phases in BTC’s market cycles, dormancy flow is calculated by dividing current market capitalization by annualized dormancy value (USD), as follows:</p>♦<p>Dormancy flow provides the following chart, ideal for both bottom-catching historical global lows and assessing whether the bull market remains in relatively normal conditions:</p>♦<p>Whenever network value remains high relative to the yearly moving average of its realized dormancy in USD, the bull market can be considered as “healthy,” since price remains high relative to the market’s annualized spending behavior. Whenever dormancy value overtakes market capitalization at lowest longitudinal levels, the market can be considered in full capitulation — a good historical buy zone.</p>Caveats<ol><li>Destruction (dormancy’s numerator) is prone to false signals on daily variance. The most prominent example of this is last December, when the Coinbase exchange moved nearly 5% of Bitcoin’s total supply. To avoid misinterpreting these false positives, it is recommended to best use dormancy by looking at continuous trends in the oscillator (smoothed by medians or moving averages) as opposed to its daily noise.</li><li>Just like with NVT and other on-chain metrics, dormancy should be viewed with an increasing caution for major fundamental shifts in detecting on-chain activity. Several recent or future developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem will ultimately contribute, at different stages and in different degrees, to a loss of power in the signals provided by these indicators. Examples of this may include: concentration of speculative liquidity in BitMEX and other exchanges, new custody solutions for institutions, the Lightning Network, sidechains, among others.</li></ol>Acknowledgements<p>Many thanks to Willy Woo, Adam Taché, and Murad Mahmudov for their invaluable input and support in the improvement of this piece.</p>Sources and Data<ol><li>Smith, Reginal D. “Bitcoin Average Dormancy: A Measure of Turnover and Trading Activity.” Ledger, February 2018.</li><li>CoinMetrics.io: Coindays destroyed, transaction volume, supply, and price data.</li><li>Unchained-Capital.com: HODL waves data.</li></ol>Authors<ol><li>Reginald Smith, independent researcher.</li><li>David Puell, Head of Research @ Adaptive Capital.</li></ol>♦♦<p>Bitcoin Average Dormancy was originally published in Adaptive Capital on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Bitcoin is the Antivirus (Mushroom Medicine) — Part 3 / 4♦<p>We’ve all heard the incredible potential of a Bitcoin future. I’m certainly on board for sound money and social scalability.</p><p>However, this drama will take decades. What if Bitcoin doesn’t survive long enough to realize it’s full potential?</p><p>Thankfully Satoshi learned from failed attempts at private money. Bitcoin’s genetic code was engineered for maximum survivability.</p><p>In this article, we’re going to explore the fertile macro environment and Bitcoin’s survivability through the lens of fungi.</p><p>Here’s the whole series for reference:</p><ul><li>Part 1: Bitcoin is a Decentralized Organism (Mycelium)</li><li>Part 2: Bitcoin is a Social Creature (Mushroom)</li><li>Part 3: Bitcoin is the Antivirus to Uncertainty (Medicine) → this one</li><li>Part 4: Bitcoin is a Catalyst for Human Evolution (Space Money) — coming soon!</li></ul><p>Let’s dive in!</p>Honey Bees, Varroa Mites, and Mushroom Medicines<p>In 1997 a curious Mycologist by the name of Paul Stamets observed a unique behavior demonstrated by honey bees. The bees went out of their way to consume water containing mushroom spores. “Hmm that’s interesting” thought Paul.</p><p>15 years later, Paul started to connect the dots. Honey bees were dying at an unprecedented rate due to colony collapse disorder (CCD). The bees were dying in part, by infestations of Varroa Mites which transmit deadly viruses such as Deformed Wing Virus and Lake Sinai Virus.</p><p>Chemicals used in modern agriculture poisoned the bees so their immune systems are too weak to fend off the Varroa Mites. As bees travel around they spread the Mites to all nearby bees leading to a 70% decline in Bee populations since 2005.</p><p>Who cares about the bees?</p><p>Bees are a bedrock species responsible for pollinating a large percentage of our food sources (avocados, almonds, etc). If we lose the bees, there are countless downstream effects such as lost jobs, destroyed ecosystems, and reduced food security.</p>♦(Image source)<p>Back to our mycologist Paul, who in 2012 made a monumental realization: fungi are known to support immune systems — the bees must have instinctively known to drink the fungal water. Paul tested his hypothesis and soon after demonstrated that using a simple antivirus “mushroom medicine,” we can reduce the effects of Deformed Wing Virus / Colony Collapse by 80%.</p><p>Our current monetary regime is the Varroa Mite</p><p>Our current central banking based monetary regime is just like the pesky Varroa Mites attacking our financial markets.</p><ul><li>Varroa Mites are hard to kill — fiat currency regimes benefit from a monopoly on violence</li><li>They spread viruses on everything they touch — market distortions, cronyism, regulatory capture</li><li>Negative downstream effects — capital misallocation, increased time preference, limits human productivity, increases risk of catastrophe.</li></ul><p>Bitcoin is the antivirus (mushroom medicine) that “saves the bees.”</p><p>Bitcoin (mushroom medicine) prevents the spread of our destructive financial hegemony (Varroa Mites) which will usher in a new era of human achievement (saving the bees has secondary effects such as ensuring food security).</p>Heading into the Great Unknown<p>We’re heading into a period of uncertainty never before witnessed by our civilization. The fiat money experiment is on shaky ground and our social systems are beginning to break down.</p><p>Globally, we’re facing unprecedented debt-to-GDP levels. The Fed, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England now appear to “own a fifth of their governments’ total debt.” Central banks are running out of moves.</p><p>In a last ditch effort, European Central Banks are pushing negative interest rates. Are we really going to allow the hegemonic banking system to CHARGE depositors for storing our digital fiat in their insecure panopticon banks?</p><p>How about China?</p><p>China’s real estate market is shaky and long overdue for a correction. Capital controls and seeking yields in a cooling economy have led to inflated real estate prices in China. What happens when the market corrects and everyone rushes for the door? Better have a plan ₿.</p><p>And the US?</p><p>The US is currently over $22 Trillion in debt, however don’t expect the US to default on their obligations. Former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said “the United States can pay any debt because we can always print money to do that.”</p>♦<p>In an enlightening article titled This is Water, Ben Hunt explains how artificially suppressed interest rates (easy money) lead to decreased productivity and a zombification of our financial markets. This same pattern foreshadowed the 08/09 financial collapse.</p>♦<p>Social structures are showing weakness</p><p>Countries around the world are seeking to eliminate physical cash. Cash is a fundamental tool for privacy and is a requirement to maintain an open society. Without physical cash (or Bitcoin), citizens are at the mercy of the financial surveillance machine. A slippery slope indeed.</p><p>Can’t forget China’s Social Credit System. Soon China’s surveillance technology will be exported all around the world.</p><p>Young people don’t trust their governments or financial institutions. 40% of Americans cannot afford an unexpected $400 expense. No wonder potential Democratic nominee Andrew Yang is gaining steam in the polls while campaigning for Universal Basic Income.</p><p>An uncertain future is a perfect substrate to breed extremism. Democratic Socialism, Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), Negative Interest Rates Policy (NIRP), the war on cash, widespread consumerism, and mounting student debt are merely symptoms of a derelict regime.</p>Our legacy institutions are simply not equipped to deal with the complexity of the information age.<p>Current attempts to fix the political-economical machine from the inside are unironically powered by the “waste heat of war machine” (h/t Vinay Gupta). We need a systemic change. Something cut from a different cloth.</p><p>What if a sound money regime (Bitcoin) is an antidote to the madness?</p><p>It is my hope that in the future, we’ll look back on our current “fiat banking experiment” with disgust. How could we live under such an archaic regime for so long?</p><p>Just like fungi transforms dead and dying organic matter into new life, Bitcoin will transform our decrepit banking system into a robust financial foundation upon which new growth can occur.</p>The Great Filter of Cryptocurrencies<p>Can bitcoin survive long enough to reach its full potential?</p><p>Cypherpunks, Anarchists, and Voluntarists have been trying to create private, non-government money for a very long time. In fact, modern attempts date back more than 30 years, since the early days of Chaumian Ecash, to E-gold, and B-Money.</p><p>Despite moderate success of private money before Bitcoin, eventually they were all shut down by overreaching governments and/or business interests.</p><p>The Great Filter Theory</p><p>The Great Filter theory was developed after noticing our lack of success finding intelligent life in the universe. Where is everybody?</p><p>The theory predicts: during life’s evolutionary process, there are some obstacles that are extremely unlikely or impossible for to overcome. That obstacle is “The Great Filter.”</p><p>For example, what if every time an advanced civilization created nuclear bombs it ended up destroying itself? In this scenario, it might be statistically improbable to survive long after inventing nuclear weapons.</p>♦(Source: The Fermi Paradox by Tim Urban which is my favorite blog)<p>For Cryptocurrencies, The Great Filter is surviving nation-state level attacks.</p><p>Bitcoin is the only monetary species that has a chance of surviving the great filter. More on this below.</p><p>Why would a nation-state or entrenched business want to attack a competitive form of money?</p><p>In short: he who has the gold, makes the rules.</p><p>The two main benefits of controlling the money supply are the ability to inflate the money supply (shadow tax) and the Cantillon effect .</p><p>The Cantillon effect describes the uneven expansion of the money supply. When the central bank prints new money, those closest to the money (banks and big corporations) profit from new “cheap money.” By the time the rest of the population receive the new money, price inflation has already begun.</p><p>The Cantillon effect results in a wealth redistribution from the poor to the rich.</p>♦<p>The government goes to great lengths to protect their monopoly</p><p>Like E-gold in the 1990s, any competing cryptocurrency can thrive in times of peace. However, when sufficiently agitated, those in power will lash out to protect their interests. History is littered with examples.</p><p>Between 2006–2008, the US government expanded the definition of the ‘money transmitter license’ (under the Patriot Act) to target E-gold. In its peak, E-gold was processing over $2B worth of purchases per year. Unfortunately, the US government took advantage of the centralized nature of E-gold, busted down the door, and shut it down.</p><p>Moral of the story? Governments do not like competition.</p><p>In fact, Congressman Sherman from California recently called for a complete ban of Bitcoin. Sherman is surprisingly enlightened. He understands Bitcoin’s true mission: Creating a new global base money that cannot be weaponized by the global superpower du jour.</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>Today in Congress Rep.

I hope it’s obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems that doomed them. I think this is the first time we’re trying a decentralized, non-trust-based system.” — Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote><p>In order for the full potential of Bitcoin to be realized, it needs to be so resilient that even nation state level actors cannot successfully kill Bitcoin. This meant preventing any party from having full control over the system.</p><p>Parallels with Fungi: the most resilient species on our planet</p>♦Ancient mushrooms called Prototaxites<p>Over 1.3b years of evolution, fungi have perfected the art of staying alive. Unlike plants, fungi do not rely on sunlight, instead they find/create their own food. Fungi do not have a centralized point of failure making them resilient to attacks. When sufficiently perturbed, fungi steal genetic code from their ecological neighbors (Horizontal Gene Transfer).</p><p>Since complex life evolved on our planet, we’ve experienced 5 great extinction events where 75–96% of all life on earth perished.</p><p>During each cataclysmic event, fungi inherited the earth due to their anti-fragile nature. In an effort to survive “the great filter,” Bitcoin mimics effective evolutionary strategies observed in the fungi kingdom.</p>Can Bitcoin Survive “The Great Filter?”<p>How could you kill bitcoin? Turn off the internet? Make it illegal to use? Tax it to hell?</p><p>Any cryptocurrency that cannot (feasibly) survive a nation-state level attack is pointless. Simply delaying their inevitable demise.</p><p>Satoshi designed the Bitcoin super-organism to survive “The Great Filter” and to resist corruption. This lofty goal kick-started an evolutionary path separating bitcoin from all the other cryptocurrencies and “blockchain projects.”</p><p>Does this mean Bitcoin is guaranteed to survive the great filter?</p><p>Not necessarily. It’s impossible to know until the day it suffers a coordinated attack by a state-level actor. However, Bitcoin is the only existing cryptocurrency that stands a chance. Let’s explore some positive trends in Bitcoin’s survivability toolbox.</p><ul><li>Bitcoin is unregulatable. No one person or entity in charge. Code is free speech. Each country has their own competing jurisdiction.</li><li>Game theory protects Bitcoin from a global coordinated attack. Nation states compete with each other. Unlikely to see top nations cooperate. If the US bans BTC, China has incentive to adopt. Nations not benefiting from the current USD regime have incentive to adopt BTC.</li><li>Bitcoin’s PoW protects the ledger with an “energy shield.” By anchoring Bitcoin to real economic value (energy), the only way to change the ledger is to “re-do all the work” aka spend the same amount of money in the form of electricity. h/t @danheld</li><li>Bitcoin inspires a religious fervor from its supporters. Ideologically motivated “hardliners” act as an immune system. Surviving the scaling wars (NYA/S2X) demonstrates this. Bitcoiners “provide cover fire” until Bitcoin gets through the door. (h/t Bitcoin Sign Guy)</li><li>Bitcoin can route around ISP censorship. Bitcoin has a growing network of alternatives to the mainstream internet (mesh networks, HAM radios, and satellites). Maybe even routing transactions through a mycelial network(theoretically possible).</li><li>Bitcoin is an idea, ideas are eternal. Bitcoin spreads like a mind virus. Even if somehow the current form was “killed,” the idea will live forever. “This Snow Crash thing — is it a virus, a drug, or a religion?” Juanita shrugs. ‘What’s the difference?’” h/t @nealstephenson</li><li>Bitcoin’s privacy improvements reduce taxability. CoinJoins and other privacy technologies will minimize the ability for governments to attack Bitcoin through predatory tax legislation. Thank you @wasabiwallet @SamouraiWallet</li><li>Bitcoin minimizes the ability to cheat. Bitcoin doesn’t rely on trust. Think “can’t be changed” instead of trusting that a system “won’t be changed.” Bitcoin recognizes leaders, formalized governance, and concentration of power as attack vectors waiting to be exploited.</li><li>Nation states underestimate Bitcoin. This buys time for Bitcoin to get stronger + harder to kill. The hegemonic banking system is digging their own grave with shovel made of 100% pure hubris. If only we had a ₿ackup plan</li></ul><p>So far, we haven’t seen any serious state level attack on Bitcoin. However, if Bitcoin continues to absorb value there is an incentive to attack it. In the future, we’ll call this period in Bitcoin’s life the “great peace.”</p><p>Alternative Game Theory: Honey Badger Lives Here</p><p>Bitcoin only needs to convince a few super powers that the reward of adopting it outweighs the risk of attacking it.</p>♦<p>This game theory is similar to having a sign in front of your house that says “Security system installed” or “big angry dog lives here.” Doesn’t matter if you actually have a dog or security system, the threat alone acts like a deterrent to would-be attackers.</p><p>Bitcoin has a sign in the front yard that says “Beware of Honey Badger.” This sign reminds nation states that they cannot easily kill Bitcoin.</p><p>If nation-states attempt to destroy their monetary competition, they’ll highlight the very need for bitcoin in the first place. And yet, the longer they wait, the stronger Bitcoin becomes.</p>The “Blockchain Industry” is a Red Herring<p>First, it’s important to understand that blockchainers, stable coiners, security tokenizers, and corporate chainers do NOT compete with Bitcoin. They taxonomically branched off and are attempting to satisfy a separate niche.</p><p>By and large, the “blockchain industry” is a Red Herring, leading businesses and governments to false conclusions. It serves as a distraction and unwillingly provides cover fire for Bitcoin.</p><p>Does that mean we should shun the blockchainers? No. They simply mistake Blockchain Hype (Mushroom) for Bitcoin (Mycelial Network).</p><p>We should first attempt to educate them as most people were not born Bitcoiners. That being said, deliberate scammers deserve to be flamed.</p><p>How the “blockchain industry” helps Bitcoin…</p><p>Blockchainers tie up government resources, train future developers, confuse incumbent businesses, and lull banksters to sleep.</p><p>Banks like JP Morgan will train hundreds of blockchain developers. Eventually they’ll discover Bitcoin and say goodbye to boring bank coin &amp; and instead join the peaceful revolution. JP Morgan is funding their own demise? How poetic.</p><p>Zuckerberg will soon put a “crypto wallet” in everyone’s pocket. Instead of competing with Bitcoin, ZuckBucks may actually attempt to compete with USD. Either way, it gets people comfortable with non-state money on their phone similar to WeChat and Alipay. The first widespread censorship of ZuckBucks will nicely demonstrate the need for BTC in the first place.</p><p>Blockchainers and scammers claim Bitcoin is old and can’t scale. It’s Beanie Babies and myspace. They paint Bitcoin has a friendly, but limited-use fungus, that “brought us the blockchain.”</p><p>While the blockchain zeitgeist chases their tail, Bitcoin is quietly growing underground, fusing with the “roots” of the legacy finance system, building resilience, recruiting volunteers, infecting curious minds like a cordyceps mushroom, and preparing for “The Great Filter.”</p><p>If we’re lucky, Blockchainers will distract global superpowers just long enough for Bitcoin to become “too big to fail.”</p>Let’s Wrap Up<p>Did you enjoy part 3? Part 4 is coming out soon where we will explore Bitcoin as a catalyst for human evolution. Here’s Part 1 and Part 2 in case you missed them.</p><p>Part 4 teaser: Let’s assume Bitcoin fulfills its destiny as the global monetary base. What are the effects of unleashing a globally accessible, technologically advanced, open, ideal money? Bitcoin enables humanity to reach the heavens. Bitcoin is space money. Bitcoin is the renaissance.</p><p>Follow me here on medium and twitter to be notified when part 4 is released. Come say hello on twitter, my DMs are open.</p><p>Thanks for reading,<br>Brandon</p><p>PS: Lots of people have asked for resources to learn more about fungi.</p><ul><li>I suggest watching Paul Stamets on Joe Rogan’s podcast.</li><li>If you only have 17 minutes, check out Paul Stamets TED Talk: 6 Ways Mushrooms can Save the World.</li><li>Curious how the forest communicates?

  ♦<p>A Simple, Commonsense Guide</p><p>Introduction</p><p>There is growing recognition that U.S. securities laws are applicable to most fundraising activities undertaken by developers of blockchain technologies, particularly when they sell pre-mined blockchain tokens to the general public at an early stage of development. Thus, many blockchain aficionados are aware that ICOs, IEOs and other types of blockchain token transactions can violate securities laws. There is also some consensus beginning to form around anti-patterns that typically will create a high risk of a token being regulated as a security — for example, ICO marketing that stresses the potential upside of the token based on the seller’s continuing efforts to develop the technology.</p><p>However, there is less awareness around patterns of securities laws compliance for blockchain token sales. Indeed, there is a common misunderstanding that U.S. regulators — in particular, the SEC — have adopted policies that essentially make legal compliance impossible for blockchain projects involving utility tokens that may increase in value. The aim of this article is to correct that misunderstanding by providing a no-frills overview of the most noteworthy and potentially useful of the available compliance paths:</p><ul><li>the no-premine path</li><li>the consumer product sale path</li><li>the utility-token-as-security-token path</li></ul><p>These paths will be summarized in this article at a high level only; to fully explain all of the nuances of each of the paths would require a treatise. This article also assumes familiarity with blockchain technologies and at least a layperson’s awareness of securities laws — thus, it does not explain how blockchain works, what a token is, or what the Howey test is; there are plenty of resources for that. Finally, the article is meant to be user-friendly for non-lawyers. Thus, in many places I simply state my opinion, informed by the law, but make no attempt to explain my reasoning by reference to the applicable doctrinal tests/statutes or to vulcanize my positions against potential objections from other lawyers. Accordingly, this is not a definitive analysis, an academic treatment, an operating manual for DIY lawyering or legal advice given by me to you — it’s a primer, a head’s-up, a conversation-starter, one lawyer’s opinion, and that’s about it. Take from it what you will.</p><p>It is also worth noting that in this article, aside from one point relating to a novel feature of securities laws in the blockchain context, I am avoiding normative statements about securities law or the benefits or detriments thereof. For what it’s worth, I believe securities laws in the U.S. could do with significant reform to reduce the costs of fundraising and public company reporting, but I do believe any such reform should be focused on securities generally rather than providing lighter regulation specifically for blockchain-based instruments just because they are blockchain-based. But that is an article for another day. Here, I merely take securities law as a given, and try to avoid normative analysis.</p><ol><li>The No-Premine Path</li></ol><p>This is the development path followed by Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Monero, ZCash, GRIN and Litecoin. Developers self-fund the software development, or take no-strings-attached donations to fund development. The developers then launch the network (or, really, the software client that enables the network) when the software is ready.</p><p>The launch of the network entails the publication of an open-source software client that incorporates certain consensus and network communication rules embodying a ‘blockchain protocol.’ Anyone can download the client and run a node. At genesis of the blockchain, each node can perform services for the network — mainly combining valid transactions into blocks with a requisite proof of satisfying the applicable anti-Sybil-attack method (e.g., proof-of-work) — and thereby earn freshly minted token rewards in accordance with the consensus rules baked into the client. Since all of the nodes are running the same client/ruleset, a blockchain emerges that all those nodes agree upon as being canonical, and the literal or figurative account balances on that blockchain represent a distribution of the token to the various network participants.</p><p>In this type of launch, no person is selling tokens to another — rather, depending on how you look at it, either no sale of tokens is occurring, or the only sale of tokens that is occurring is a sale with a legal buyer (the nodes who perform services) but no legal seller — sitting in the seller’s position is the network itself, a thing which does not own the tokens it’s selling (it prints them de novo) and also does not have the “legal personality” necessary to serve as a contractual counterparty such as seller, despite providing seller-like functions.</p><p>Bitcoin serves as undeniable proof that the fiat-denominated value of such tokens can increase significantly over time, due to network adoption effects or changes in macroeconomic factors that cause the token to be more useful, or at least more “in demand” — whether for reasons of use, financial speculation, or both. Thus, people acquiring Bitcoin early can later sell them for a (sometimes enormous) fiat profit. Also, such networks can and do attract self-appointed champions — early adopters like Roger Ver or Andreas Antonopoulos who might heavily promote the value of the token and might mine or purchase the token in the meantime, hoping their efforts and those of other like-minded early adopters will drive up the price of the token over time. However, importantly, the network is designed in such a manner that it does not easily allow such self-appointed promoters to end up in a role similar to that of an issuer of securities. This is evidenced, in the case of Bitcoin, by the fact that even Roger Ver, who once was so influential in promoting Bitcoin that he was known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” was eventually forced to create a new Bitcoin fork in order to pursue the scaling and adoption roadmap he advocated for. Likewise, even some developers who at one time had Bitcoin Core repo authority and were influential core developers lost that influence and had to create forks of Bitcoin in order to pursue their particular visions. By contrast, Facebook Inc. would never have to fork the Facebook platform to introduce new improvements meant to drive up the value of Facebook stock.</p><p>Despite this profit potential, which in other circumstances can implicate securities laws, it is widely recognized (including by SEC staff members) that Bitcoin is not a security, and I also believe that other tokens following the same ‘no-premine’ pattern as Bitcoin are in general unlikely to be securities under U.S. federal securities law. To explain why the SEC staff and other securities attorneys are reaching this conclusion in doctrinal terms would be a complex discussion beyond the scope of this article. A cartoon thumbnail version of the reasoning is this: in all these cases, there was not an affiliated group of developers or entrepreneurs who were raising capital by selling Bitcoin, Dogecoin, etc. to people who hoped to make money from increases of value in those tokens depending predominantly on the entrepreneurial efforts of that group.</p><p>Thus, the manner in which tokens such as Bitcoin and GRIN were launched is one possible compliance path for launching a blockchain network without treating the tokens as securities.</p><p>Important caveat: We are only talking about certain types of tokens here. The manner of sale or distribution of a token is not the only important factor in determining whether it may be a security. That all of the aforementioned tokens (BTC, DOGE, etc.) are essentially ‘blank’ payment tokens — true “cryptocurrencies” — is not coincidental. For purposes of this article, I consider such tokens, as well as tokens meant to essentially confer an access or service right (such as ETH 1.0 in its capacity as providing the ability to buy computation services from Ethereum nodes), to be “utility tokens” that do not have intrinsic securities-like features. The “no premine” path, if properly followed, is also very likely to result in such utility tokens not being securities. (It is also important to note that keeping a token out of the securities regulatory regime and the SEC’s jurisdiction may more strongly situate it as money that is subject to money transmitter regulations and FinCEN ‘s jurisdiction— but that’s a topic for another day.)</p><p>On the other hand, if the token in question functions more like a financial instrument —such as by entitling the token holder to receive passive (dividend-like or interest-like) income (including other tokens of the same type) or to exchange the token for other tokens out of a potentially growing pool (e.g., a bonding curve contract) — then it is much harder to establish that the token is not a security, even if it was not premined. Similarly, any token (such as ATOM or TEZOS) that can generate dividend-like returns , but only if staked, and which also carries governance voting rights, would require a more nuanced analysis. Although such staking/governance tokens may not be securities and the “no-premine” path may help in reaching that conclusion, the intrinsic features of such tokens are too rich and complex, and too inherently similar to some securities like stock or derivatives, for the no-premine path to give reasonable assurance, in and of itself, that such tokens are not securities.</p><p>2. The Consumer Product Sales Path</p><p>This is the path that most ICOs claimed to be following, but really weren’t — the sale of a consumer product to customers who wished to use it. It is widely recognized that the sale of a consumer product to consumers is not a securities transaction, even when the purchase is a “pre-order” and the consumer product may require some additional research and development or production. Kickstarters are not securities sales. Thus, when dealing with a token like ETH, which can be used to deploy smart contracts on Ethereum and pay nodes fees for running the smart contracts, or a token like MANA that entitles the holder to virtual land in a virtual world, an argument may be made that an ICO is basically a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign — that is, users are pre-buying a consumer product they wish to use, rather than buying an investment instrument and thus a security. However, while this argument works in theory, it is rarely plausible in practice.</p><p>It is possible that some early ICOs like that of Ethereum really were “Kickstarters” — i.e., that the vast majority, or maybe close to all, of the buyers of the premined ETH were people just curious to try out the technology or wanting to support it as an experiment via a donation. But money ruins everything. The enormous and widely publicized price appreciation of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies has created a general awareness of the profits that can be made by acquiring cryptocurrencies early in a network’s life, or the even greater profits that can be made by buying a commitment for the tokens before the network exists at all. Moreover, buyers typically hope to make such profits based on the selling team’s efforts, not merely because of impersonal market forces. Because of this climate for purchasing and profiting off tokens, it cannot reasonably be doubted that the vast majority of interest in ICOs and IEOs is investment-oriented rather than use-oriented. Simply put, most people buy most tokens to flip them for profits accruing because of the talents of the developer team that sold the token, rather than to “consume” the tokens.</p><p>For any who might doubt that an investment motive is predominant, one strong indication of the same is the manner in which people evaluate and conduct due diligence into token sales, as evidenced in many public forums. Prospective token buyers typically undertake a detailed evaluation of the token-selling team and its “advisors” to assess their competence, reputation, the likelihood of them having long-term loyalty to the project, and their potential to increase the token’s value over time through their work. A frequent concern expressed in public discussions regarding token sales is that the development team maintain “skin in the game” by claiming a material (but not excessive) percentage of the premined token for themselves and subjecting those tokens to time-based or milestone-based vesting. Prospective token buyers may also view the involvement of sponsors with a financial motive such as Binance (an exchange) or ConsenSys (a venture incubator/investor) as badges of quality, and may “free ride” off of the due diligence they presume these higher-resourced and profit-motivated sponsors have undertaken. Due to the combined participation of venture capital investors and more casual “retail” investors, many ICOs and IEOs have raised money far in excess of Ethereum’s and far in excess of even the most successful Kickstarter campaigns — raising hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Objectively speaking, these events far more closely resemble massive preferred stocking financing rounds (or, at the high end, IPOs) than they do consumer product pre-sales.</p><p>Since the law does not involve mind-reading machines, the law looks to objective indicia of the nature of the transaction to measure whether buyers purchased an instrument primarily for investment purposes such that the instrument should be regulated as a security. In light of the climate described above, as a practical matter the presumption by regulators will be that most buyers in most ICOs are buying tokens for investment purposes, unless there is extraordinary evidence to the contrary. Hence SEC Chairman Jay Clayton’s statement at one time that he had ‘yet to see’ an ICO that was not a sale of securities. On the other hand, factors such as the following, alone or in combination, could provide a reasonable basis for concluding that a token is not being sold as a disguised security but rather is being sold to end-users as a bona fide consumer product:</p><ul><li>Each buyer of premined tokens only buys an amount of the token that, based on how that token is used in the network, an ordinary consumer would reasonably be expected to use for ordinary consumer purposes in a reasonable amount of time — say 1–3 years (with 1 year being very typical of, say, ordinary consumer software licenses and 3 years being on the long side).</li><li>The token is “use it or lose it”. This could mean the token expires after a period, or that the token has a “reverse-vesting” feature so that a fraction of each account balance is burned each month if not used for its intended purpose.</li><li>The token is a ‘one-time use’ token that is irrevocably redeemed or burned upon use, rather than a token intended to continue circulating and potentially increasing in value indefinitely.</li><li>The buyers are the ordinary and natural buyers for the intended consumer use case. Venture Capital firms typically do not buy $5M in consumer products with the intent to resale them — they buy securities. Thus, the presence of a Venture Capital investor in your token sale is a strong indication that the token is likely a security. A consumer typically does not spend (absolutely or relatively) large amounts of money to pre-order a lifetime’s worth or more of a software product— thus, a consumer spending that much on a token is unlikely to solely or even predominantly be buying for a consumer purpose, and conversely is very likely to be buying for an investment purpose. This is just common sense.</li><li>Secondary sales of the token are prohibited, or are only permitted to bona fide users, or are capped at the initial sale price or some small percentage increase on the sale price. The issuer does not encourage secondary trading of the token on exchanges; or, better still, the issuer takes active measures to limit speculative secondary trading, such as Zynga took with Farm Bucks exchanges back in the heyday of Farmville.</li><li>The project is “sufficiently decentralized” such that the token buyers would not reasonably expect the token price to increase based predominantly on the entrepreneurial efforts of developers or business entities who are united with the token buyers in a common enterprise. See Section 3 infra for more on this topic.</li></ul><p>The above is not meant to be a formula, and I am certainly not saying that a token must have any or all of these properties in order not to be a security. For example, if it were clear that the token were only being sold to consumers who wanted to use it as a product (rather than flip for profit), and the potential for price appreciation of the token based on the efforts of the token seller has some soft or hard limit, then more active secondary trading might be possible without running the risk of the token being deemed a security.</p><p>What I am pointing out, however, is that based on the way token sale dynamics have evolved to date, there will be a powerful presumption that people buying into ICOs, IEOs or other sales of premined blockchain tokens are doing so to profit from increases in value of the token as a result of the entrepreneurial efforts of the token sellers, and thus as part of a securities transaction. Accordingly, very strong evidence to the contrary along the lines suggested above is needed in order to counteract that presumption and firmly establish that such a sale is more like a Kickstarter sale than a sale of securities.</p><p>3. The Utility-Token-As-Security Path</p><p>This path is being followed when a token seller premines a utility token and sells it to raise capital for developing the project, but at the same time recognizes that as a result the token will (at least initially) be regulated not only as a consumer product but also as a security. Alternatively, this path may also arise when tokens, such as the The DAO tokens, are not premined, but have intrinsic financial features (such as delivering a return from a pool of funds in a common enterprise) that cause it to fall within the ambit of securities regulations, and thus the only manner of lawfully issuing such tokens is as securities.</p><p>Although to date this has been a slow-moving and uncertain path, we are beginning to get clarity on how this can work, and my prediction is that it will become the go-to path for projects wishing to raise capital through premined utility token sales or for general distribution of tokens that passively generate financial returns.</p><p>Due to the richness of lawful securities sales mechanisms, this path has many potential sub-paths. Here I will mention the three sub-paths most likely to actually be useful. Interestingly, these three paths can also be chained together in a bootstrapping process that uses earlier, smaller, more private rounds of funding to scale up into the level of network adoption and funding that is needed for larger, more public rounds of funding — a process that has been followed, most notably, by Blockstack, which presold utility token commitments to venture capital investors via SAFTs in a private placement, and now has a Reg A+ filing pending before the SEC which, if qualified by the SEC, will allow Blockstack to sell the tokens as securities to the public.</p><p>A. Private Securities Placement followed by Rule 144 Sales and/or Sufficient Decentralization</p><p>In general, any security may only be offered or sold in the U.S. if one of the following conditions is true: it is registered with the SEC as a public offering, or it fits within one of the exemptions from registration. Registration is expensive and time-consuming and involves recurring compliance costs; thus, the registered offering path is typically undertaken only by relatively mature companies. Seed-stage capital, on the other hand, is commonly raised under the “private placement exemptions” afforded under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 for sales of securities by an issuer not involving a public offering and the concomitant Regulation D “safe harbors” promulgated by the SEC pursuant to 4(a)(2).</p><p>When a blockchain project is at a relatively early stage, utility tokens can be sold as securities in a private placement. Private placements do not involve expensive SEC negotiations, review or filings, only a simple confirmatory Form D filing. Thus, aside from any contract documentation between the issuer and the purchasers, the overhead costs of doing a compliant private placement can be fairly low. Depending on the particular form of private placement selected, an issuer may raise an unlimited amount of funding very publicly (but only from accredited investors), an unlimited amount of funding privately (from a mix of accredited investors and up to 35 “sophisticated” non-accredited investors with certain disclosure protections) or raise smaller amounts very publicly from any type of investor. There are then two paths to these tokens becoming freely tradeable:</p><ul><li>They will become freely tradeable securities after a 12-month holding period, but only (an important caveat) when sold by non-affiliates of the issuer.</li><li>They may cease to be securities and become pure consumer products or commodities if the blockchain project has become “sufficiently decentralized” such that token holders no longer have a reasonable expectation of profits from the entrepreneurial efforts of the issuer or other “active participants” who assume an issuer-like role. Getting comfortable that “sufficient decentralization” has been reached will generally require obtaining a legal opinion, an SEC no-action-letter, or both. The SEC has signaled its willingness to grant such no-action letters in appropriate cases.</li></ul><p>After the point of decentralization, those who transact in the token will need to keep an eye on market developments to ensure that a new party does not re-centralize the technology and essentially step into an issuer-like role that requires the securities regulations to be applied again. While some might see this looming threat of renewed securities law regulation as a negative and as impossible to monitor, it is my belief that such a re-centralization would be fairly obvious. Moreover, the “punishment” of facing securities law regulation will serve as a sort of poison pill to disincentivize re-centralizations of decentralized networks. Thus, securities law is both an unexpected incentive to decentralize when centralized, and an unexpected disincentive to avoid re-centralization once decentralized. This is good and cypherpunk-positive. It furthers the intended aims of decentralized, P2P blockchain technology and almost becomes a form of added cybersecurity on the social layer.</p><p>One significant drawback to the private placement approach is that, because the tokens are securities, an ordinary cryptocurrency exchange will not be able to trade these tokens; only registered securities exchanges will, and currently few or none would be willing or able to. Likewise, brokers or dealers in such cryptocurrencies would need to be registered as securities brokers/dealers. However, these drawbacks occur at points of centralization where the technology is essentially being re-intermediated rather than providing the benefits of disintermediation and P2P interaction that cryptocurrencies are designed for. Accordingly, it is both appropriate and to be expected that traditional regulations would apply in those centralized nerve centers. Furthermore, in the future, there will be more registered securities intermediaries that are able and willing to transact in tokens that are securities. Until then, anyone who believes that it is essential for unregistered intermediaries to be able to transact in their blockchain token as part of a business on behalf of others should ensure that their token is not a security by avoiding selling the token in connection with an investment scheme. One way of doing so is by using the “no premine” path outlined in Section 1 above.</p><p>Another, potentially more serious drawback arises from the initial transfer restrictions that apply to tokens sold as securities in a private placement. The 12-month holding period for non-affiliates is bad enough, but what about project insiders who may have received the token as compensation and as “affiliates” of the issuer are subject to more stringent transfer restrictions? Even after the applicable holding period, these affiliates will not be able to transfer their tokens unless the issuer has satisfied public information requirements that are nearly as burdensome as the disclosure requirements for a Regulation A+ offering or full-blown registered offering. That, in turn, affects the availability of the “sufficiently decentralized” path, since the project probably cannot become sufficiently decentralized when its original developers are unable to exit their positions of control/influence by liquidating all or a large portion of their tokens. In effect, this does mean that project teams following this path should set aside a significant legal budget to prepare disclosures that would enable the securities tokens to become freely transferable by affiliates after the applicable holding period has been satisfied.</p><p>B. Public Securities Offerings Under Regulation A+</p><p>Regulation A+ is a set of SEC rules promulgated pursuant to the JOBS Act of 2012, which was intended to liberalize public securities sales by start-ups or “emerging growth companies”. Such public securities sales are sometimes confusingly referred to as “crowdfunding” — not to be confused with Kickstarter-style or Indiegogo-style crowdfunding.</p><p>By complying with Reg A+, a company may sell up to $50M of securities in a public offering that may include non-accredited investors (subject to certain investment limits by each particular non-accredited investor). A critical advantage to Reg A+ offerings is that, unlike the private placements described above, the securities sold in a Reg A+ offering are not subject to a holding period or other transfer restrictions — they may freely be traded on day one.</p><p>Thus, projects wishing to fund development of blockchain technology by selling utility tokens as investments, and thus securities, may file a Reg A+offering with the SEC and, once the SEC has reviewed and “qualified” that offering, proceed with the sale and have tokens that have been sold and are transferable in accordance with all applicable securities laws. For payment-style tokens that do not carry voting rights, the issuer can take the position that the tokens are not “equity securities” and thus that widespread ownership of the tokens does not require Exchange Act registration, thus avoiding the need to re-intermediate the technology through the use of transfer agents that may otherwise be required to avoid Exchange Act registration. Similarly, the issuer may take the position that any tokens that are held by the issuer are functionally not acting as securities in the issuer’s hands, and thus may avoid any requirement that the issuer itself register as an investment company because it holds unsold tokens.</p><p>Blockstack is the first significant blockchain project to make their Reg A+ filing public, has taken the positions summarized above with respect thereto and is currently awaiting qualification. According to the SEC and securities attorneys active in the space, there are a number of other projects that have filed under Reg A+ but still remain non-public and are awaiting SEC feedback.</p><p>Sounds pretty cool, what’s the catch? Well, there are a few pretty big issues that make Reg A+ expensive, burdensome and not to be undertaken lightly.</p><p>First, cost. In the case of Blockstack, it raised over $50M through private placements of SAFTs and other token investment vehicles before proceeding to a Reg A+ offering. As the first Reg A+ for a utility token that is also a security, it is also likely that Blockstack’s legal fees and other expenses in pursuing Reg A+ qualification were far greater than the typical Reg A+, and I would guess they were more similar to the typical costs of a full-blown registered offering/IPO. Blockstack likely could not have undertaken such a Reg A+ offering if it had not managed to attract very large private placements beforehand. In addition, there are ongoing compliance costs for teams that follow this path, since issuers with securities outstanding under Reg A+ are required to do periodic reporting with the SEC in a manner similar to exchange-act-registered companies, except that the reporting standards are less extensive and therefore somewhat less expensive to keep up with. Nevertheless, once Blockstack is qualified and some other projects get qualified under Reg A+, we will have good models for how to achieve this and the costs of doing so will be lower.</p><p>Secondly, a Reg A+ approach can make it harder to develop sustainable trust-minimized cryptoeconomic incentives for a network, since the issuer would have to pre-qualify even tokens that are later to be issued as rewards for “mining” or similar activities. As with private placements, the limits on issuance and the reporting obligations would cease if the project were able to reach a point of “sufficient decentralization” such that the token is no longer regulated as a security, as confirmed by the SEC. Alternatively, the project sponsors could create a new Reg A+ offering after 12 months, or could seek to do a fully registered offering that would enable more flexible issuance of security tokens pursuant to a shelf registration statement.</p><p>Although this Regulation A+ path is quite burdensome, nevertheless it appears to me that this is the SEC’s answer to “how do we do a compliant ICO”? Inevitably, it creates much higher barriers to entry in conducting a public token sale for investment purposes. But, I am not convinced that is such a bad thing. The other compliance paths explained above still remain available for teams that do not need to or want to raise huge amounts of money, and the stick of high compliance costs upon raising large amounts of money from the public combined with the carrot of reduced compliance costs once sufficient decentralization has been achieved will keep teams honest in pursuing the stated end-goals of the technology: to be trust-minimized, decentralized and peer-to-peer. To the extent a team fails to achieve those goals on a reasonable timeline, its technology may not be viable or useful, and any resulting costs or potential failure of the project may be deserved.</p><p>C. Fully Registered Offering</p><p>Finally, just for the sake of completeness, I’ll briefly describe the possibility of doing a fully registered public offering utility tokens as securities. This would essentially involve IPOing, but with tokens, and the issuer of the tokens would face the very heavy compliance costs of public SEC reporting. My expectation is that few or no projects will choose to pursue this path — instead, they will either not premine their tokens and thus try to ensure they are not securities, or, when they do sell tokens as investments, they will carefully plan to do so through a combination of private placements and Reg A+, then step away from the project, let it live or die on its own, and thus cause the SEC to agree that the tokens are no longer securities.</p><p>4. Conclusion</p><p>Thus concludes my brief overview of securities law compliance paths for blockchain projects. In case you forgot ’em, I invite you to read the disclaimers I dropped in the introduction about the purposes and style of this article — deliberately non-legally-technical and non-scholarly, meant as a starting point rather than an endpoint. If anything, my hope would be that people reading this think twice before assuming that the SEC is “destroying blockchain innovation” or that deploying a blockchain project in a legally compliant manner is impossible. Blockchain technology is still new, and does exist in tension with certain regulations, but regulators and legislators are both working on striking a reasonable approach to this technology. It appears to me that most regulators now recognize that when the technology functions as intended by truly being decentralized, it plays by different rules; but during any interim or bootstrapping period when it is still centrally managed, the normal rules must apply. I think this is a fair and reasonable position, one that the industry can work with, and wrote this article to try to illustrate that vision.</p><p>If you are a company or developer thinking about deploying a blockchain project or doing a complex blockchain-related project, and are looking for compliance or deal-execution advice, please feel free to contact me at g.shapiro@zerolaw.tech.

  <p>ICOs, also known as utility tokens, have dominated the cryptocurrency industry for the past three years. They’ve been credited with Ethereum’s growth, a new financing model and a gateway to a decentralized future. But what are utility tokens, really? Economically, what do they do and what value do they add?</p><p>This article will show that utility tokens have no real utility and that they’re schemes to extract fees on transactions from a decentralized application. Those applications, in turn, have little to no chance of traction because of the friction introduced by these tokens. In other words, this article will show how ICOs, despite being championed as vehicles of value creation, actually destroy value.</p><p>But before we get to all that, we need to define an important concept: rent-seeking.</p>Defining Rent-Seeking<p>Rent-seeking is the process of extracting money from a transaction without adding value. The easiest way to describe rent-seeking is taxing some activity without doing anything useful. Think of a typical government bureaucrat who rubber stamps whatever comes through, say in the copyright office. That person doesn’t add anything, but extracts a tax on these transactions by getting a salary.</p>♦<p>Rent-seekers make money without doing very much. As every management consultant knows, large corporations have many people who do very little. These are your rent-seekers and they manage to wiggle their way into cozy corners of the market that lack natural competition, such as monopolies, or where their transactions are mandated by regulation.</p>Why Rent-Seeking is Attractive<p>Rent-seeking is popular because there’s not much work or risk involved. People like earning in excess of the work they put in. The bigger the gap, the better. This is why so many Ivy League graduates pursue careers in Banking and Finance despite lacking any particular inclination toward those fields. Those fields are rife with rent-seeking opportunities with enormous wealth potential.</p>♦<p>The tragedy of rent-seeking is that it’s a net negative to society. Instead of producing goods or services, rent-seekers simply collect taxes that create unneeded friction. That friction is stealing from the productive value creators to fund the unproductive rent-seekers.</p>Why Rent-Seeking Exists<p>The existence of rent-seeking is strange, especially in a supposedly market economy. How is it that someone who is a drag on the economy is allowed to exist in an efficient market? Shouldn’t other companies without rent-seekers destroy the companies with rent-seekers in the free market?</p><p>This would be correct in a true market economy. Unfortunately, western economies (or any other for that matter) are nowhere near true market economies. A true market economy requires sound money and that’s precisely what these economies lack.</p><p>Economies based on fiat money funnel new money to preferred groups, who in turn have an unfair advantage over everyone else. Preferred groups use this advantage to build regulatory moats around their industry and create something akin to a monopoly to essentially force everyone to use them.</p><p>This is most obvious in government monopolies such as the public education system and government agencies, but it’s also true of large banks, and through them, large companies. Every large bank gets access to insanely low interest rates which allows them to re-lend those funds on a fractional-reserve basis for a large, no-risk gain. Should those funds get paid back, they make money, and should those funds not get paid back, they get a nice bailout. Those profits, in turn go to the rent-seekers who feast off of the heads-I-win-tails-you-lose situation.</p>♦<p>Newly created funds also go to large companies as they’re seen as least risky. This isn’t necessarily because they’re great businesses, but because the likelihood of bailouts is higher when companies are larger. The large companies in turn have a huge advantage over smaller competitors with a much larger war chest. Often, this war chest is used to buy out their competitors.</p><p>In essence, fiat money creates a lot of rent-seeking opportunities. The excess money created in fiat money systems finds its way to people that don’t add anything, generating friction in what’s supposed to be an efficient market. This is why government and corporate bureaucracies exist.</p>ICOs, Democratizing Rent-Seeking!<p>What ICOs have done is formalized the rent-seeking process. A utility token’s nominal value is the utility value, such as being able to place a bet in a dApp. But due to the dApp being restricted by the token, anyone wanting to use the dApp must go through the holders of the tokens. Instead of using an existing currency, the peddlers of ICOs offer early buyers the “opportunity” to be a gate-keeper for the dApp. In other words, utility token holders are rent-seekers that get to tax people that want to use the dApp.</p>♦<p>Of course, adding such friction to an application is bound to dampen the uptake of the application, and that’s exactly what we’ve seen. Utility tokens are almost never used for the dApp and instead used for pure speculation. You can think of this situation as a group being sold rent-seeking positions, only to find that there aren’t enough transactions coming through to justify having paid so much.</p><p>Far from making dApps useful, utility tokens almost certainly doom dApps to failure. Utility tokens not only lack utility, but detract from whatever utility a dApp might have by introducing friction. The only people that use the token are the holders whose expected profits from taxing dApp transactions are much lower than they anticipated. The only utility consumption of the token tends to be by these holders, who reason that by using the dApp they can create the perception that the dApp is useful and drive up speculative demand for their tokens.</p>Taking advantage of the human desire for rent-seeking<p>This process illuminates the clever way in which ICOs have operated. ICOs use the carrot of potential rent-seeking opportunities as a way to entice buyers. When the application doesn’t end up being popular, the buyers are left holding the bag. Tokens meant to make them rich are the very thing that prevent the dApp from succeeding.</p>♦<p>This is sadly how Ponzi/Pyramid schemes work. They promise some easy rent-seeking opportunities to gullible people who in turn expect to make money for doing very little work. Unfortunately, the utility demand for the token is non-existent, so the only demand left is the speculative demand. Speculative demand requires more and more buyers, creating an unsustainable bubble.</p><p>In other words, utility tokens, because of their utility-killing nature, require more and more gullible people or the whole scheme falls apart.</p>Ethereum, Rent-Seeking from ICOs<p>One might point to Ethereum as an exception to the rent-seeking rule based on the fact that it has been the platform of choice for “successful” ICOs. Ethereum has been successful because it’s taxed every such ICO. Anyone who wants to create an ERC20 token has had to transact in ETH. Every ETH holder is able to rent-seek off of those that want to buy rent-seeking opportunities!</p><p>In other words, the Ethereum token has done well precisely because it’s found more greedy and gullible people that want their own rent-seeking opportunities. The prospect of being able to be at the top of a new pyramid of rent-seeking has tempted and suckered them.</p>♦<p>ETH has successfully taxed lots of these schemes and ICOs are really new layers of a Pyramid scheme or new suckers in a Ponzi scheme. It’s not a surprise then that so many tokens have tried to compete in this market as being at the top of a Pyramid scheme is enormously profitable. Every dApp “platform” (e.g. EOS, TRON, NEO, etc) is essentially trying to be at the top of a new pyramid so that they don’t have to pay a tax to Ethereum!</p>Conclusion<p>Utility tokens are rent-seeking devices. Because access to the application is bound to those tokens, they act as a way to tax anyone that wants to use these “decentralized” applications. Such rent-seeking introduces friction, which is why there have been so few people that have used these applications.</p>♦About the level of sophistication of ICO token buyers<p>The honest way to build applications would be to use an existing currency like Bitcoin, USD or even ETH. Instead, ICOs are creating their own money and enticing early adopters with rent-seeking potential. This is a Ponzi/Pyramid scheme in a different guise.</p><p>Utility tokens are rent-seeking vehicles that doom applications to failure. The sooner people realize their economic purpose, the better off we’ll be.</p>♦

  <p>This article introduces Statechains, a novel layer two scaling protocol for Bitcoin with some unique features. We’ll go through its strengths and weaknesses, look at how it integrates with the Lightning Network, and discuss the privacy implications of combining it with Blind Signatures.</p><p>I first unveiled my concept of Statechains by presenting it at Scaling Bitcoin in Tokyo. Since it was a technical conference, my presentation was not focused on a general audience. As a result, it has largely gone under the radar, which is a shame because it’s a unique layer two protocol with useful features that can strengthen the Bitcoin ecosystem. Hopefully this article can convince you of its merits. Note that this article is high-level and won’t have all the technical details. If you want those, please refer to the talk, paper, and mailing list post.</p><p>Statechains are a layer two protocol, meaning it enables the transfer of value without burdening the Bitcoin blockchain. This can help with scaling and save fees. Unlike Lightning it is not trustless, but it maintains a high degree of censorship resistance (more so than federated sidechains) due to the fact that withdrawing on-chain is permissionless.</p><p>The basic idea behind Statechains is that you lock up money between two parties in a 2-of-2 multisig: the Statechain entity and the user. When the user wants to transfer the money (the entire UTXO), they simply hand over their private key, which we call the transitory key, to the intended recipient.</p><p>And that’s basically it. There is a lot more complexity operating in the background to decrease the potential for cheating, but in a nutshell this is the core concept, and as you will later see, it’s deceptively powerful.</p>♦Non-custodial, because the Statechain and Bitcoin blockchain get updated in tandem (atomically)<p>In essence, the money is controlled by the Statechain entity and all the users who know the transitory key. The Statechain entity could theoretically move the money in cooperation with any of the users, but simply promises to only cooperate with the last user that received the transitory key. One thing the Statechain entity cannot do, is move the money on their own.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the weaknesses. If the Statechain entity goes offline, loses their key, or refuses to cooperate, is the money gone? No. Every time the money changes owner, an off-chain transaction is also generated. This allows the last recipient of the transitory key to redeem their coins on-chain without the assistance of the Statechain entity. The Statechain entity simply cannot hold your money hostage.</p>♦Each time the money moves on the Statechain (B to C), an off-chain Bitcoin transaction is created. We use eltoo to ensure that only the final recipient can withdraw the money, without the help of the Statechain entity.<p>Can the Statechain entity still cheat by colluding with one of the previous users that know the transitory key? Yes they can, but chances of this happening are minimized for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>We keep the Statechain entity honest by making sure they disclose every signature they make (via clever use of Adaptor Signatures). Any attempt to cheat by the Statechain entity would immediately become apparent.</li><li>The Statechain entity isn’t actually a single entity, but a federation — a group of members (e.g. 8-of-12 multisig) of which a majority has to agree in order to cheat. This security model is comparable to federated sidechains such as Liquid, with the added benefit that users can withdraw without permission.</li><li>Every UTXO has a different transitory key and a different set of prior users. To steal all the coins, the Statechain entity (or a hacker) would have to find prior users that are willing to collude for every UTXO. In the unlikely event of theft, it is therefore likely that only a subset of coins gets stolen.</li></ul><p>Are Statechains custodial? Surprisingly, they are not. This is one of the key distinguishing features of Statechains. If a court ordered the Statechain entity to confiscate someone’s coins, they simply wouldn’t be able to comply, since they only have one of the two keys. They can’t freeze the assets either, because the owner can always redeem the coins on-chain without their help. There is also no risk of fractional reserve, forcing hard forks upon users, or other issues that are commonly associated with custodial control.</p><p>One unique feature of Statechains is that it operates at the level of the UTXO. This has some interesting consequences:</p><ul><li>UTXOs are transferred in full: if you lock up 1BTC into a Statechain, you have to transfer that full amount, but bigger UTXOs can always be traded for smaller ones (e.g. 2x 0.5BTC for 1BTC)</li><li>You can swap multiple same-value UTXOs with users, which is equivalent to a coinjoin to increase privacy, particularly when done over Tor</li><li>Lightning channels can be opened on top of Statechain UTXOs in order to enable smaller payments (see the next section for details)</li><li>Betting/oracle protocols that require UTXO ownership can be performed efficiently (e.g. 2-of-3 multisig, Discreet Log Contracts)</li><li>Non-fungible colored coins on the Bitcoin blockchain can be transferred off-chain via Statechains (e.g. RGB)</li><li>User verification of payments scales better than sidechains, because coin history is linear, so you only need to verify the history of the exact coins that interest you</li></ul><p>The key insight here is that anything that requires creating one or more new Bitcoin UTXOs, can now be done off-chain via Statechains. It’s also worth noting that Statechains are chain-agnostic, meaning it’s possible for a Statechain entity to manage UTXOs from different blockchains and allow users to trade between them (not unlike a DEX).</p>♦An example of a swap with different assets. User B trades his 2BTC for 200LTC with C.<p>As I recently argued on Twitter, Bitcoin has no choice but to scale via the second layer. It is therefore absolutely crucial that this kind of technology gets built. We need many different layers that make different trade-offs, so people can pick the layer that best suits their needs.</p><p>Here is an (admittedly over-simplified) overview of where Statechains fit in:</p>♦*It could be argued that a layer cannot be truly censorship resistant if it isn’t trustless — the coins could still potentially get stolen, even if unlikely.<p>In short, Statechains are novel in the sense that they allow you to change UTXO ownership off-chain, while preserving a large degree of censorship resistance due to the ability to withdraw on-chain. It is non-custodial, which naturally reduces risk and makes it easier for the Statechain entity from a regulatory point of view. The end result is a unique layer two protocol with its own distinct strengths and weaknesses.</p>Statechains and The Lightning Network<p>One particularly powerful feature which I already alluded to but deserves further examination, is the interoperability between Statechains and the Lightning Network. In order to open a channel on the Lightning Network, you need to obtain a UTXO on the Bitcoin network and share its ownership with someone via multisig. Statechains provide this exact functionality: any UTXO that exists on a Statechain can be turned into a Lightning channel at any time.</p><p>The beauty is that this is kept completely hidden from the Statechain entity. All the entity sees is that the entire UTXO got transferred, but they are entirely unaware that this is actually a 2-of-2 multisig Lightning channel. The two protocols are kept completely separate. The Statechain entity doesn’t need to be involved, even when forced on-chain closure occurs.</p>♦The channel can be opened on the Statechain without the help or awareness of the Statechain entity.<p>By utilizing Statechains, you get to open and close channels off-chain at minimal costs. Is your channel too small? No problem. You can simply transfer your existing channel over to a larger UTXO. This can be particularly powerful considering it’s hard to know ahead of time how much capacity will be needed in a channel. Now you can cheaply experiment, and once you have a stable channel, you could choose to effortlessly move the channel over to the base layer by exiting from the Statechain.</p><p>Another really potent consequence is that Statechains enable you to on-board people onto the Lightning Network instantly. If you have money on a Statechain, you can immediately send a portion of it to a friend by turning the Statechain UTXO into a shared Lightning channel. And if your friend prefers to minimize their exposure to the Statechain entity, you could directly move the channel on-chain.</p><p>One more interesting feature that Anthony Towns and Olaoluwa Osuntokun alerted me to, is that when you open a Lightning Channel factory via a Statechain, adding or removing people from the factory can occur without on-chain friction, making it far more flexible.</p>Enhanced Privacy with Blind Statechains<p>Statechains, as described thus far, limit the control the Statechain entity has over its users, but does allow the entity to learn a lot about every transaction, and most of this information gets transparently published for the world to see. Engaging in the Statechains equivalent of coinjoin helps mitigate this to a large extent, but we can do even better!</p><p>Blind signatures can make the Statechain entity completely unaware of what they’re signing. The transactions would become entirely unseen — it would literally not be possible to tell whether the entity is facilitating the transfer of money, or if they’re signing something else. You’re essentially blindly changing the signing rights over a private key without changing the key itself, which undoubtedly has use cases other than cryptocurrency.</p>♦The Statechain entity is signing blinded messages — it does not know whether these are Bitcoin transactions or something else entirely.<p>Not only would this increase the privacy of the system, but it also really challenges the legal definition of what it means to “process” a payment. All the Statechain entity would do is blindly sign messages at the request of a chain of users. A user gets to request one signature and also appoints a new user that gets to request the next one. All requests and corresponding blind signatures are transparently published.</p><p>For those who are familiar with the details in the paper, the key difference compared to regular Statechains is that users are expected to unblind and verify the chain of signatures prior to accepting a payment, because the Statechain entity can no longer ensure that what it’s signing is correct. If one of the previously requested signatures in the history is incorrect, the recipient simply rejects the payment. Unblinding can be done by anyone who controls the transitory key (thanks to Jonas Nick for checking my transitory key hashing method for unblinding).</p><p>In a sense, Blind Statechains are a variant of Chaumian cash, but it actually manages to move one step beyond it. Chaumian cash makes it impossible for a server to know who is receiving the money, but if the server refuses you service, you essentially lose the asset. With Blind Statechains the server doesn’t even know whether it’s transferring money, it doesn’t know who is receiving it (particularly when combined with coinjoin), AND it cannot stop you from redeeming its value on-chain on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p><p>Finally, it is worth noting that the Statechains protocol is the culmination of a bunch of technologies by many developers. As the author, my contribution was limited to creatively putting them together for the novel purpose of transferring UTXO ownership (more specifically: key signing rights) off-chain. Credit goes to the creators of Sidechains, Schnorr Signatures, Adaptor Signatures, Blind Signatures, eltoo, Graftroot, and undoubtedly many more works that have inspired me but I am failing to recall.</p><p>Thanks to Adam Gibson, Bryan Bishop, and Calvin Kim for the article review and comments.</p>medium.com/media/7209b663dd3d073023c75b4bed71a55c/href♦

  Fears over the declining block reward are real.<blockquote>I hypothesize several hundred billion, in present value USD, would be an adequate security budget — Dan Held, blog.picks.co/bitcoins-security-is-fine-93391d9b61a8</blockquote><p>Dan dismisses concerns about Bitcoin’s security once we transition to fees; he’s wrong. [Note: Dan claims I misread maliciously, and that is an annual budget, hence I have fixed up below.]</p><p>Taking his quote above, let’s assume we want it to cost $̶1̶0̶0̶ ̶B̶i̶l̶l̶i̶o̶n̶ $700 Million USD to undo 100 blocks, widely considered an “uncrossable threshold” in bitcoin; at that point, miners’ coins start disappearing and chaos ensues.</p><p>That implies we’re paying $̶1̶0̶0̶ ̶B̶i̶l̶l̶i̶o̶n̶ 700 Million USD in fees per 100 blocks, so each block costs $USD 1̶B̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶f̶e̶e̶s̶!̶ $7M in fees.</p><p>With the absolute theoretical future best-case (Schnorr sig sharing into one giant coinjoin) we can squeeze about 10900 inputs and outputs into a block; giving us a fee of $̶1̶0̶0̶,̶0̶0̶0̶ $700 per transfer.</p><p>That’s why there’s genuine concern about Bitcoin’s security as the subsidy is removed, and at the same time a real concern over fee levels for those who want it to be used by non-millionaires; $10 fees gives us at best 1/70 of the security budget Dan says is adequate.</p>♦

  <p>Thanks, Christoph, that’s very kind. I think equality of participation is implied by any blockchain due to censorship resistance, but that prediction markets are one of the most obvious cases where that would be useful. Not only are there serious legal concerns with attempting to run one from within a corporation (in fact, it is basically illegal in most of the developed world) but the entire premise of a well-functioning prediction market is that it becomes dramatically more useful the more people (and the more different kinds of people) are using it. There is vastly diminished social benefit in running one that isn’t open to practically everybody because you would inevitably be stopping prices from moving in the ‘right’ direction and biasing in favour of the preconceptions of whatever group you do allow to participate. You want anybody willing to participate to do so.</p><p>There is another, more subtle, point that individual markets run by a central body must be conceived of by the central body before they are organised, almost by definition. Therefore very unusual or bizarre events will be unlikely to be hosted, since the centralised organisation will have fixed costs and will need to make money on every market. But again, it is beneficial for there to be markets in anything and everything, because what this does is force those with sincere belief to make that belief known to the whole world. Prediction markets have enormous social utility as aggregators of perceived probabilities that otherwise remain widely distributed solely in people’s minds.</p><p>One interesting area I didn’t discuss in the post is that it isn’t really the entirety of the prediction market that would need to ‘run on a blockchain’, but only the payments, provided the token had a viable smart contract system. All that really matters to the integrity of the prediction market is that people who buy securities get paid appropriately. That the UI is buggy or occasionally goes down would be a far less serious and really superficial concern. In fact, it is really more ‘smart contracts’ that are relevant here, not ‘blockchain’ specifically. So you could, for example, have the infrastructure of the market exist as an open source tool that is really facilitating multi-sig timelocked bitcoin transactions. This could actually be a very exciting bitcoin layer 2 utility (or ‘3’ if built on Lightning for whatever reason) as opposed to the likes of Augur, which bundles the entire functionality into a tool on top of Ethereum.</p><p>This is all just academic, to me, though, hence my deliberate agnosticism in the post towards specific projects. I am first and foremost a fan of prediction markets and applaud any effort to make them work.</p>♦

  <p>why are prediction markets so accurate, why do they lend themselves to blockchains, and what do blockchains do for them?</p>♦Photo by Kay, via Unsplash<p>What is a prediction market?</p><p>A prediction market is a market for the buying and selling of futures contracts on binary events. The market is structured such that individual contracts are priced between $0 and $1. A participant buys a contract on an outcome A, or its complement, ~A, for, say, 50¢, and receives $1 if outcome A occurs, or $0 if it does not. If we designate the price of a contract on A to be pA, then p~A will be priced at $1-pA, although depending on the mechanics of the market, there may be a slight bid/ask spread to provide revenue for the exchange, or alternatively a fee to buy the contract, to preserve the balance of the contract prices.</p><p>This is very similar to how bookmakers construct their books by adjusting the odds offered to match punters’ bets against one another, but there is a crucial difference here reflecting the construction of the market. The contracts exist as securities rather than isolated wagers. This allows for considerably greater liquidity, given that participants need not necessarily wait until the event occurs. This liquidity in turn ought, in theory, to aid price discovery, since participants with relevant insight or information can take advantage of what they deem to be temporary mispricing rather than having to lock in their bets.</p><p>Where this gets interesting is in interpreting what the prices mean, and therefore what a mispricing is, and what ‘the expectations of participants’ are. The setup of prediction markets lends itself to interpreting the price as the probability of the outcome. For uncertain events for which a probability density function cannot be analytically proven to exist and which cannot be re-run a million times to derive such a function synthetically (so, most of real life) assigning a probability to a specific outcome can only meaningfully be interpreted as stating what odds you deem to constitute a fair bet. A more common and readily understandable application of assigning probabilities is to imply confidence in deviation from a base rate, but this is really a special case of the general principle mentioned above; the base rate is derived from a historic ‘large enough’ sample for which the mean would be deemed ‘fair’ for a random iteration, and the question is whether we have relevant information leading us to believe that the non-random iteration at hand ought to deviate from the distribution mean, and hence whether ‘fair’ odds are different from those derived from the historic data.</p><p>If you think something is 50% likely, then you think even odds are fair. In general, if you think something is p% likely, then you think odds of (1-p)/p : 1 are fair. This calculation can be reversed to turn typical bookmaker odds into probabilities, but a prediction market deliberately uses this presentation to state the prices of bets in terms of probabilities rather than odds. If you think the probability of outcome B is x% likely, and that (1-x)/x : 1 is therefore a fair bet, then a price lower than x means odds better than those you deem to be fair. They are to your advantage and should be taken. Of course, if you did take such a bet, in a prediction market as with a bookie, the result would be to push the odds on offer towards what you deem to be fair. With enough people behaving this way, the price is pushed towards what the entire sample deems to be fair, weighted by each individual’s willingness to shoulder the risk implied by the mispricing.</p><p>Sounds interesting, but what’s the point?</p><p>The point is that, insofar as prediction markets have been allowed to function properly, they have been far, far superior to either ‘experts’ or to public polls at predicting events. There are two separate points to untangle here: why prediction markets are so accurate, and how they have tended to function in real life. Both points lend themselves to discussion of blockchains in the following section.</p><p>Why prediction markets are better than experts is simple, and the principle is widely understood in other contexts. The Wisdom of Crowds, after James Surowiecki’s 2004 book of the same name, is most easily conveyed as the principle that the mean of a large sample of estimates of some variable will likely be closer to the true value than the majority of the individual estimates. The key, and indeed a necessary condition, is that the participants’ estimates are independent and hence reflect a diversity of perspectives. This is the essential disqualifying factor for when crowds become exceptionally unwise, as in a stock market bubble, for example. But if the individual estimates draw on esoteric knowledge and insights, a large enough sample will tend to produce a desirable effect. Prediction markets can only function if this is the case: if everybody believes the same thing, then nobody will take the other side of any contract. But this still doesn’t answer why they are better than polls. Prediction markets can arguably be thought of as weighted polls, where the weightings reflect sincere belief, as captured by willingness to risk loss on the prediction.</p><p>More simply, we would say, willingness to bet. This has two mutually enhancing effects. The first was articulated most fully by Hayek in addressing the socialist calculation problem by describing markets as aggregation mechanisms for widely dispersed knowledge (see The Use of Knowledge in Society, and, Competition as a Discovery Procedure) The essence is that the possibility of profit entices those with unusual knowledge to engage in the market, hence moving prices in the direction that best reflects reality, despite the fact that no single person or even large subgroup of people have or could possibly have the relevant knowledge in its entirety. The counterpoint to the possibility of profit is the possibility of loss, which is equally valuable; as profit rewards and pulls in those with knowledge, loss punishes and pushes out those without knowledge. This is particularly valuable in the case of predictions as we want to weed out the pernicious cases of participants who have no idea what they are talking about submitting estimates for some reason other than contributing to the correct prediction — professional prestige, for example, or misguided institutional architectures that pressure participants to make meaningless predictions they would rather not. A bet is a tax on bullshit, goes the saying originating with economist Alex Tabarrok. Put up or shut up, goes another, attributed to many millions of people whose social groups tend to mouth off about sports with the intent to impress one another rather than to be correct.</p><p>This understanding of prediction markets leads back to an earlier point, that they have been allowed very limited scope to function in modern society due to widespread mores against gambling in the West. To the best of my knowledge, there have been three large scale attempts to run prediction markets: The Iowa Electronic Markets is a market run by the University of Iowa under an exemption from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as it is ‘run for research and education purposes’. Bets are limited to $500 and primarily offered on political events, so it is not as robust as we might hope, despite having an impressive record against polls and experts. PredictIt functions similarly, and is exempt from CFTC sanctions on the condition that (basically) it doesn’t scale properly. Probably the most successful private effort was InTrade, which was run out of Dublin and effectively shut down by the CFTC (Buzzfeed documents the decline here) The final example, the Policy Analysis Market, run by DARPA out of the US Defence Department, was a proposal to use prediction markets to forecast terror attacks, which was shut down amid public outcry. I will mention as well that BetFair, substantially more reputable than InTrade ever was, could perhaps be considered a prediction market, but I would argue is really just a web-native bookmaker. The difference is largely academic in some regards, but consists primarily in the inability to use the bet as a security, which I argue is crucial for the functions I will propose below.</p><p>What do blockchains do for prediction markets?</p><p>Assuming that we now believe that prediction markets are very good at doing what they say on the tin, I propose that there are three reasons to be excited about how blockchains and prediction markets may come to interact. The first two I will discuss relate to how blockchains may enable better functioning prediction markets than previously existed, while the third goes the other way — I believe prediction markets may provide a key enabling feature for other, more exotic sounding functions of blockchains.</p><p>The first, and I believe arguably the most obvious and often only reason to believe in any particular public blockchain project, is that of censorship resistance. As mentioned above, most attempts at organising prediction markets skirt regulations on gambling. Given that any number of law enforcement agencies around the world could shut down an attempt to scale a prediction market on a whim, it is pointless for any corporation to devote capital to such an enterprise. If built on a public blockchain (and designed robustly to avoid extraneous attack vectors) this concern disappears immediately as it is unrealistic that the network can be compromised, barring a worldwide clampdown on any and all Internet activity, which seems rather out the question. I believe the most important effect will not be that such a corporation can now exist for profit — I think this is probably the most common misunderstanding of the potential of public blockchains. Insofar as existing for-profit network functions will be ‘replaced’, I think it is far more likely that what replaces them will essentially be automated utilities and not ‘companies’. Whatever new companies come into existence will rely on the fact that this function will be resistant to censorship, rather than providing it themselves.</p><p>However, this raises an interesting problem: before we get too excited about removing all meddling authority from the market, don’t we need an authority in this case, in order to judge what actually happened and hence who won the bets? The short answer is ‘no’, although the reason is a little complex, and, we will see, actually makes it theoretically superior to a centralised source: not only can blockchain-based markets not be censored, the truth can’t be corrupted (or rather, it is very, very difficult to corrupt the truth, as opposed to one central source who just needs to be bribed, or themselves have an interest in the outcome) Augur is one such blockchain prediction market, and I include a link to the white paper here (to be clear, this is not an endorsement of Augur the project, its current functionality, or REP the token — it’s just the most obvious thing to point to currently if readers want to follow up) In short, the ‘truth’ in question is crowdsourced when the event in question has occurred in real life, and those who ‘vote’ on the correct answer are paid out of the participation fee, very possibly the token native to the prediction market but not necessarily, while those who vote on the incorrect answer lose some staked value — the money / token / whatever that previously would have gone to the operator of the market being reserved for this pay-out. The idea here is that the ‘truth’ is an obvious Schelling point to gravitate towards for a great many voters whilst the ‘false’ outcome can only plausibly be pursued in bad faith. That doesn’t mean this won’t happen, and again I am talking in theory here, not about any current market. There are significant issues to be engineered around to successfully scale any attempt. But were this to ever succeed, we see that the widespread belief of the utility of the market is precisely what is leveraged to provide utility in the first place. This is similar to the traditional explanation of the pointlessness of 51% attacks on the bitcoin network — that the action itself would destroy the value of the network that the attack is designed to capture — although in this case directed at a far more specific goal than gaining the ability to alter the transaction record: verifying the truth of prior claims about the real world.</p><p>The second reason that blockchains enable more effective prediction markets is far more prosaic: that censorship resistance also implies equality of participation via scalability with no obvious upper bound. Anybody can set up a market without needing to make the case to a central party. This is less nefarious than the first instantiation of ‘censorship resistance’, but is key to the next section regarding smart contracts: in order to write a smart contract, you need to know it will immediately become active, and not need to apply to some central body to verify it. Utilisation of blockchains makes this kind of contract less like betting at a bookie and more like creating a web page. If you have access to a smart contract platform, nothing can stop you.</p><p>What do prediction markets do for blockchains?</p><p>Another reason to be excited about the combination relates to what is known as an ‘oracle’. To understand the importance of both oracles and prediction markets we first need to grasp the essence of a smart contract. Despite the high-technological undertones, ‘smart contracts’ are really little more than ‘automated contracts’. The idea is that any contract, stipulating in the abstract that, if A does x, then B will do y, need not rest on the interpretation of human arbiters of x and y, particularly if they are fully quantifiable, as many commercial contracts are; when A receives shipment, pay B $z. This is not (really) open to interpretation. And yet there is a layer of time and energy costs sunk in facilitating the contract. Prior to blockchains, this was inevitable, and it would seem a non-sequitur to even bring it up. But now, in theory, both parties can lock into a secure, transparent contract whereby the if-then clause is automatically executed with no intermediary deciding that this should happen.</p><p>The problem, as is probably obvious from the example above, is how to determine that A receives shipment actually happened, which would seem to put us back at square one. Taking a step back, it is easy to see that any smart contracts where the variables in the contract are ‘on-chain’, meaning relate to data or metadata existing elsewhere on the same blockchain, can be executed with no external input. Since ‘time’ is part of the metadata of a typical blockchain, we can imagine a fixed term annuity fitting this description as per the following pseudo-code: if receive $x from account A, then while t &lt; t0, pay $y to account A and wait 1 month, which we remember will execute without fault given that the currency being used to pay is the essence of the blockchain itself. The reason the first example is tricky is that there is no obvious ‘on-chain’ way to determine that A received a shipment. This leads to the concept of an ‘oracle’, which is defined more by what it would ideally do than what it is; it reports off-chain (real world) events to the blockchain so that smart contracts can be fulfilled.</p><p>I propose that the behaviour incentivised in prediction markets would make for excellent oracles. Certainly not exclusively — we might find little reason to doubt MLB.com, The Met Office, or any other number of central reporting entities on questions that are both banal and for which an expensive apparatus for gathering the data already exists. But for many cases, I think this makes a lot of sense. To understand why, we need to think about what qualities the ideal oracle would have. There are obvious ones such as accuracy, provability, and consistency, which don’t really tell us much about how an oracle would work, but rather just how it must not. It is easy to see that what we are really asking here is what the ideal qualities of a ‘judge’ are, since all we require is somebody or something to judge that the conditions of a contract have been fulfilled. In fact, professional arbiters are one proposed solution to the oracle problem. I am not arguing against arbiters here, but I suggest that the core question that we will always return to, and which arbiters do not totally solve, is: how do we know it’s not lying? For any proposed solution, we will therefore need to ask, why might they lie? Any hypothetical entity with known members, goals, an identity, etc. — in essence with interests, will almost necessarily have potential reasons to lie, or an ability to be corrupted, in some or other situation. We need a source that is beyond the interests of any self-assembling subgroup of the general population. Perhaps a randomly selected subgroup, or one incorporating the beliefs of everybody, if such a thing even exists.</p><p>But we have covered how prediction markets verify truth in (ideally) incorruptible ways. We can be nearly certain that the verified outcomes of prediction markets are not lies. We cannot be completely certain, clearly, but I suggest far more certain than for any centralised authority who can be bribed or can otherwise act in bad faith. Prediction markets leverage their own utility to reward a distributed pool of participants for acting in good faith. In addition, the second benefit of censorship resistance means that anybody can set up the market, most probably the same entity writing the smart contract, while the first benefit guarantees that the contract will not be cancelled or the parties punished once live.</p><p>We can go even further than this, in fact. We can utilise not only the trustworthy verification of prediction markets, but also their predictive accuracy. One could write a smart contract that utilises not only the verification of prediction markets, but the prices on the prediction markets for the clauses of contracts in order to grant far more flexibility in judging and responding to probabilities than is currently possible at all. For example, one could write a contract for a clause confirmed in a year that will enter a sub clause if the price of that event in a prediction market goes above 90¢ (which is on-chain). The idea here would be that the initiators of the contract aren’t confident in their understanding of the likelihood of the outcome, but that if the crowd believes it is very likely, then one course of action is probably pointless and another should be pursued instead.</p><p>What might come from all of this?</p><p>It is a separate, open-ended, and fascinating discussion as to what economic activity is improved upon by the new capabilities of blockchains. I don’t want to get too far into this particular line of thought, but my general outlook is that to ask, ‘where are there network effects?’ is a naïve approach that confuses the causes and effects of networks. Network effects are (shock, horror) effects, whereas the cause is superior utility to customers over alternatives. A better question is, ‘where could there be network effects if a value-based friction to creating them could be overcome?’.</p><p>I think the combination of insurance, financial derivatives, and gambling is a good example. Although these products vary dramatically in terms of incentives and social characteristics of participants, and so on, these are all basically the same thing: they are bets. It is not commonly realized or thought about this way, but all forms of betting rely on network effects in that building a book requires (means to some extent) depth and liquidity in a market that is matched off at scale by the insurer/market-maker/bookmaker and oftentimes presented to the customer as simply a ‘product’ concocted by the central entity, rather than the real raw ingredients.</p><p>I propose that there is a decent long run probability that blockchain prediction markets consolidate these three functionalities and provide a better service to users. The reason for this is essentially that there are significant value-based frictions to realizing network effects in all three far, far greater than currently exist, and that cannot be realized via a centralized party.</p><p>It is only currently possible to buy a future on an event if the event is known to be of such wide interest that a deep and liquid market can be virtually guaranteed to exist. This is because the bookmaker must set the initial odds and risk loss as a covering counterparty should they be wildly off the mark in the initial period before liquidity coming in starts to move the odds. If you can virtually guarantee eventual liquidity then this is less of an issue. So, sports and politics and the like are fairly safe to make markets in. (n.b. I’ll say ‘buy a future’ to cover all three options rather than ‘place a bet’. The latter is probably more easily understood but is unfortunately deemed unsavoury when the purpose is something other than entertainment)</p><p>There is one exception to this general rule: highly esoteric events can give rise to markets for futures but usually only if the buyer or seller of the future is very well capitalized. This presents two ways to overcome the risk to the bookmaker, broadly speaking: stake collateral or pay a fee. So, this might be a gambling addict pledging his car to a gangster to get in on a dog fight, or it might be a retainer paid by a wacko hedge fund to hold a credit default swap with an investment bank. We needn’t get too much further into this as it is clearly getting a little divorced from anybody’s real or relevant experiences — and I promise I’m only aware of this stuff because I’ve seen it in movies — but the general point is that the undercapitalized can only buy futures in markets that are strongly suspected in advance to be highly deep and liquid.</p><p>Prediction markets based on blockchains remove the counterparty risk to the bookmaker because there is no bookmaker in the first place: this role is automated. What this means is that there are no restrictions on what kinds of futures markets can exist: the relatively undercapitalized can make a market in anything at all. On the one hand this means that insurance, derivatives, and gambling can be done slightly more efficiently, but this brings us back to the point above about the network effects: this is not enough. It would have to be much, much better rather than just a little bit, to have any disruptive potential on this account.</p><p>Where there is enormous disruptive potential is in allowing futures contracts on anything at all. Who would want a future? Maybe an Uber driver realizes they make 3 times as much on days it rains and wants to hedge against it being too sunny for too long. Maybe a surf instructor has exactly the opposite problem and happily sells the future to the Uber driver buyer. Maybe you work in real estate in New York as well as having a mortgage on your house there, and so in a sense are massively leveraged to the New York real estate market. If something happens to the industry, your career will tank in perfect correlation to your home equity. Maybe you want to hedge that away, or maybe you explicitly want exposure to London real estate instead, for whatever reason. Maybe you are an investor in Tanzania and want to cross-hedge your exposure to Indonesian and Peruvian investments. A bank will do this for you, but for an enormous fee that is likely to outweigh any portfolio benefit.</p><p>What I am driving at here is any set of cash flows that are insecure or unpredictable for any reason whatsoever can now be hedged. The fact that people might be explicitly gambling rather than hedging simply adds depth and liquidity to make the whole thing even smoother. Clearly this could not happen before because Betfair will not sell you a weekly rolling betting line on the weather in Long Beach, nor will JPMorgan concoct you a derivative on the London property market. They might if you offer to pay them lots and lots of money, or stake lots and lots you already have. But if you don’t have lots and lots then that’s the end of it. In fact, even this argument misses the point slightly. In all these hypotheticals, you have to go and check if such a market exists, and ask that one be created if it doesn’t. In a blockchain prediction market, you can simply create markets that don’t exist without anybody considering their counterparty risk, assessing liquidity, or whatever else they think is important before they grant permission. A blockchain prediction market allows for the exchange of futures contracts by providing a relatively enormous platform for participants to find one another rather than having to go through one of a select few central exchanges, which are necessarily very large to begin with due to the subtle network effects of that business. A nice way to think about this is perhaps to compare terrestrial television with YouTube. As many people watch YouTube as watched terrestrial television 20 years ago, adjusting for population growth, but via YouTube they can all interact with each other with minimal friction. Very few people made content for terrestrial TV but anybody can make it for YouTube. It would be difficult to argue that creativity has not flourished as a result. Like YouTube is for video,* prediction markets are truly open platforms for futures.</p><p>*by ‘is’ I mean ‘should be’, but I didn’t want to disrupt the flow …</p><p>Concluding thoughts and further reading</p><p>I have tried here to sketch a case for the potential utility of prediction markets to blockchains, and blockchains to prediction markets, with as little technical detail as possible. Those wanting to dive deeper are encouraged to read the Hayek essays mentioned on market organisation, or the work of Robin Hanson on prediction markets specifically, popularised here, and fully organised here. I know of two public blockchain projects attempting to create decentralised prediction markets: Augur, mentioned in the body, and Gnosis, whose white paper is here. Veil is also interesting, and I won’t pretend to have any worthwhile technical understanding, but the idea seems to be a kind of ‘layer 2’ broker on top of Augur that improves liquidity and settlement. For background on the statistical meaning of prediction markets, see the National Bureau of Economic Research papers here and here (there are many more on the same topic but I found these to be the most helpful).</p><p>follow me on Twitter @allenf32</p>♦

  <p>Anyone coming into crypto realizes very quickly that there are a lot of different coins out there. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Tron, Cardano… How is an investor supposed to figure out which ones to invest in?</p><p>There are many arguments to be made about why diversification in cryptoassets makes little sense, including the network effect of money, but in this article, I’ll make another argument as to why adding altcoins to a portfolio that has Bitcoin makes very little sense.</p>Why Diversify?<p>The traditional reason for diversification is to optimize the risk/reward ratio. By buying, say, 10 different stocks instead of 1, the thinking goes, you can reduce volatility and downside since your eggs are spread in many baskets. The purpose is reduction of volatility and downside to minimize the risk/reward ratio. There’s a whole field devoted to doing this called Portfolio Theory, but the goals of diversification are pretty clear: reduce the risk of permanent loss and reduce volatility.</p>♦<p>When someone chooses 10 stocks for a portfolio, the stocks typically already meet some minimum requirements. For example, they’ve met some requirements by the SEC in terms of transparency, their history is available to the market and they’re under threat of penalty if they cook their books. This is to ensure that the marketing story about a stock has to conform to the underlying reality, especially their prospects and financial condition.</p><p>Diversification in this context may make sense because there’s good reason to believe that the story being told about the stock by the company is close to being true. The unstated assumption is that the risks and rewards around a stock are understood. That is, the error bars around the risk are not too big and there are good reasons to believe that the companies being considered are telling the truth. Hence diversification in a stock setting makes sense if the risks and rewards are reasonably understood.</p>The Story vs. Reality of a Cryptocurrency<p>The reality of a cryptocurrency is in the code which, unfortunately, is very dense, hard to read and impossible to understand for a large amount of people. Because cryptocurrencies exist in the digital realm, the code and the network that secures it is the reality. While the ability to analyze the underlying reality is there, it’s just not practical for most people, even experienced developers, to study the code underlying a cryptocurrency in less than a few months.</p>♦<p>On the other hand, there is usually an abundance of marketing material about a cryptocurrency. These are stories of what the technology underneath can do and speculate on use-cases envisioned by the creators. These are often whitepapers that purport to show the details of the actual system, but are not rigorously defined like code is. This is documentation that’s more understandable, and often precedes any code that gets written.</p><p>In cryptocurrency, because of the difficulty and/or expense of evaluating the underlying reality (that is, the code), the marketing story is used as a shortcut. A few may evaluate the code (if it’s available), but most use the marketing story because it’s cheaper and easier.</p>Disconnect between Story vs. Reality<p>This brings up the question, just how divergent is the marketing story vs. the underlying reality? As brought up earlier, in a stock market, the two cannot diverge much without some serious penalties. In cryptocurrency, there is no enforcement mechanism to force the story and the reality to conform. Instead, there are incentives to over-promise on the story and under-deliver on the reality.</p>♦<p>Embellishing the marketing story will result in higher price as most people will use this shortcut for their evaluation. What’s more, the reality doesn’t need to be delivered immediately and that gives the coin’s developers plenty of excuses to delay. Given that it’s an order of magnitude harder to disprove a story than to tell it, the over-promising has a good chance of not needing much defending beyond “we’ll get to it later”. In other words, exaggeration in marketing doesn’t cost much but adds a lot of demand. This is in contrast to the stock market where such exaggeration will incur some penalty.</p><p>Under-delivering the reality is another clear win for the coin’s development team. Promises that cost too much to deliver don’t have to be delivered at all. After all, they often already have the money. What they do deliver has no need to meet any sort of technical standards, either. Since it’s costly to evaluate the code that they do deliver, most people just stick with the marketing story and don’t bother much with the technical reality. The implementation can be a complete mess, the security can be unaudited, the tests can be unwritten and nobody would be the wiser.</p><p>What we find is that the incentives are such that there’s much reason to over-promise and under-deliver. The perceived reward, which is essentially a quantification of the marketing story, is perceived to be high. Since that’s the metric most people use, the price reflects a very optimistic future. As a result, the risk/reward ratio gets very high as permanent loss of capital becomes more and more likely.</p><p>In this sort of environment, it’s no wonder that so many scams have run amok.</p>The Consequences<p>By having so many people rely on the marketing story instead of the technical reality, and given the incentives of over-promising and under-delivering, we have ourselves a giant mess of an industry. Most coins are not vetted beyond the marketing story making sense (and sometimes, not even that!), and result in a giant inverted trust pyramid with the founder at the bottom.</p>♦<p>The technical reality is usually only understood by a few and everyone else trusts that what the creators put into the whitepaper reflects reality. There is nothing to really enforce that the story and reality conform, and instead the information about the coin comes from a small number of people that created the coin. ZCash might have some incredibly interesting technology, but there was a counterfeiting bug for a very long time. And this is one of the more responsible altcoins, so how much more are the other ones hiding vulnerabilities?</p><p>This means that most coins in the industry have very high risk profiles. Most of them have no hope of achieving what they purport in their marketing story. Most have no track record of delivery and can be fairly characterized as unresearched. If these were stocks, they’d be sent to the pink-sheet and have a very low price due to the risk premium. Diversifying into unresearched pink sheet stocks doesn’t reduce risk, nullifying the point of diversifying.</p>What about Bitcoin?<p>You may be asking at this point, isn’t this true of Bitcoin? That would be a fair question, but the answer would be no. The reason is because Bitcoin has been pored over technically by thousands, if not tens of thousands of people over the years. Even when the whitepaper first came out, it wasn’t the same environment we see today, where near everything gets an investment. When Bitcoin launched, few people were running nodes or mining, let alone trading it for anything valuable. The incentives for over-promising or embellishing the story weren’t there. Furthermore, the whitepaper accurately described Bitcoin and over-delivered. In fact, the whitepaper was written after the code!</p><p>Furthermore, given that Bitcoin was the first coin, Bitcoin has had a much larger scrutiny of its codebase. The obvious evidence for that is that altcoin creators often have to scrutinize the Bitcoin codebase to create their own coin. In addition, there are over 500 contributors that have had merged pull requests, making it the largest open source cryptocurrency project.</p>What about an altcoin that’s forked from Bitcoin?<p>At this point you might be wondering about coins that don’t diverge from Bitcoin very much. Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV and others are essentially small tweaks to the Bitcoin codebase.</p>♦<p>There are two questions that we have to ask here. First, what are the changes from Bitcoin? Second, how maintained is the codebase?</p><p>The first question is usually the easiest to answer and usually, the main difference is that the altcoin is centralized. The technical difference is generally small enough that including such a coin is not going to reduce risk or decrease volatility, nullifying the reason for diversification.</p><p>The second question is the much more important one. If the coin doesn’t maintain the codebase in the same way as Bitcoin, then it’s got a bigger risk. This may come in the form of a smaller development team, less developer activity or quality of merged pull requests. The changes to the code since forking can be evaluated to determine the underlying technical reality. This, too, is expensive and slow so most people don’t do it.</p><p>The case against including forked altcoins is simply that the quality is worse and that there’s no risk reduction. In other words, these coins can fairly be characterized as “worse” Bitcoins which don’t add the desired properties of risk reduction and volatility reduction to a portfolio.</p>So What Diversification Makes Sense?<p>We know Bitcoin is different from altcoins in many ways. First, Bitcoin is decentralized while altcoins are not. Second, Bitcoin at its creation did not have perverse incentives, whereas altcoins at their creation did. Third, Bitcoin has the largest market cap value.</p><p>Any exposure to this space, then, requires Bitcoin at a minimum. The question, then, is, what else do you put into your portfolio?</p><p>The answer here is to do your own research. The data out there is mostly marketing material, full of exaggerations and difficult or even impossible promises. As the non-Bitcoin coins carry pink-sheet stock level risk, the scrutiny needs to be much higher, not lower, than that put into Bitcoin. Thus, real research means evaluating the code.</p>♦<p>If you don’t know how to read the code, or worse, if the code is closed source or not written yet, that should be a complete non-starter. The technical reality of the currency cannot be verified.</p><p>If you’re capable of reading the code, but don’t want to put in the time to do so, that’s also a non-starter. There simply isn’t enough assurance with such coins to know that the marketing story and technical reality aren’t divergent. Reliance on anything else, including the opinions of people on Twitter and YouTube are likely based on the biased marketing material and/or kickbacks and not the code, which has no obligation to conform to reality.</p><p>This, in turn, means that there will have to be a significant amount of research put in to qualify a cryptocurrency as investable. Given that the market caps and/or liquidity of most coins are tiny, the time researching such assets simply isn’t worth the effort as they’re likely uninvestable anyway.</p>Conclusion<p>Diversification in cryptocurrencies makes little sense. The marketing story and underlying reality are incentivized to diverge and proper evaluation of each coin very expensive. Investing in altcoins without looking at the code is the equivalent of diversifying into random pink-sheet stocks without doing any research. Such an action would add risk and volatility, not reduce it, nullifying the whole point of diversification.</p>♦<p>In addition, given the incentives at play, looking at the code is itself likely a waste of time. This is why the pink sheet market volume is so tiny versus the NASDAQ or NYSE.</p><p>The one cryptocurrency that is sensible to invest in is Bitcoin, because it’s been qualified through its unique birth and continued maintenance through its 10 year existence. Diversification of a portfolio by adding Bitcoin really can add upside, reduce risk and reduce volatility (if it’s counter-cyclical). Adding unresearched altcoins does not and hence makes no sense.</p>♦

  ♦Sovereignty through mathematics CHAPTER ONE<p>All human interaction can be defined as trade. Yes, all human interaction. Every time a human being interacts with another, an exchange takes place. In every conversation we have, we exchange information with each other. Even the most trivial information is of some value to the other person. If information didn’t have any value to us, we wouldn’t talk to each other. Either what the other person says is valuable to us or we find it valuable to give information to them. Oftentimes both. At the core of all human interaction that isn’t violent, both parties perceive that they gain some value from it, otherwise the interaction wouldn’t have taken place at all. Civilizations begin this way. Two people finding it valuable to interact with each other. That’s all it takes. So what constitutes value? What we find valuable is entirely subjective. A comforting hug for example, probably has a different value to a two-year old than it has to a withered army general. Even the most basic action, such as breathing, encapsulates the whole value spectrum. We tend to forget that even a single breath of air can be of immense value to us under the right circumstances. A single breath is worth more than anything on the planet to a desperate free-diver trapped under ice, while worth nothing to a person with a deathwish in clean forest air on a sunny summer day. Value is derived from supply and demand, and demand is always subjective. Supply is not. Since all of our lives are limited by time, time is the ultimate example of a scarce, tradeable resource. We all sell our time. We sell it to others and we sell it to ourselves. Everyone sells their time, either through a product that took them a certain time to produce, or as a service, and services always take time. If you’re an employee on a steady payroll, you typically sell eight hours of your day, every day, to your employer. If you’re doing something you truly love to do, that eight hour day still belongs to you in a way, since you’re doing what you’d probably be doing anyway if you had been forced to do it for free. Sometimes, we sacrifice time in order to acquire something in the future. An education, for instance, gives no immediate reward but can lead to a better-paying, more satisfying job in the future. An investment is basically our future self trading time with our present self at a discount. Once again, every human interaction viewed as trade. It’s rooted in physics. For every action there is an equally large reaction. Trade is at the very core of what we are, and the tools we use to conduct trade matter a lot to the outcome of each transaction. Money is our primary tool for expressing value to each other and if the creation of money is somewhat corrupt or unethical, that rot spreads down throughout society, from top to bottom. Shit flows downhill, as the expression goes. So what is money, or rather, what ought money to be? In order for two persons to interact when a mutual coincidence of needs is absent, a medium of exchange is needed in order to execute a transaction. A mutual coincidence of needs might be “You need my three goats and I need your cow”, or even “both of us need a hug”. In the absence of a physical good or service suitable for a specific transaction, money can fulfill the role of a medium of exchange. What most people fail to realise is that the value of money, just as the value of everything else, is entirely subjective. You don’t have to spend it. The problem with every incarnation of money that mankind has ever tried is that its value always gets diluted over time due to inflation in various forms. Inflation makes traditional money a bad store of value, and money needs to be a good store of value in order to be a good investment, or in other words, a good substitute for your time and effort over time. Bitcoin tries to solve this by introducing to the world absolute scarcity, a concept that mankind has never encountered before. To comprehend what such a discovery means for the future, one needs to understand the fundamentals of what value is, and that we assign a certain value to everything we encounter in life, whether we admit it or not. In short, we assign value to everything we do, value is derived from supply and demand, and supply is objective while demand is subjective.</p><p>Free trade emerges out of human interaction naturally and it is not an idea that was forced upon us at any specific point in time. The idea that markets should be regulated and governed, on the other hand, was. Free trade is just the absence of forceful interference in an interaction between two humans by a third party. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong or immoral about an exchange of a good or service. Every objection to this is a byproduct of the current global narrative. A narrative that tells us that the world is divided into different nations and that people in these nations operate under various sets of laws, depending on what jurisdiction they find themselves in. All of these ideas are man-made. No species except humans does this to themselves. Animals do trade, but they don’t do politics. Bitcoin, and the idea of truly sound, absolutely scarce money, inevitably makes you question human societal structures in general, and the nature of money in particular. Once you realise that this Pandora’s box of an idea can’t be closed again by anyone, everything is put into perspective. Once you realise that it is now possible for anyone with a decently sized brain to store any amount of wealth in that brain, or to beam wealth anonymously to any other brain in the world without anyone ever knowing, everything you were ever told about human society is turned on its head. Everything you thought you knew about taxes, social class, capitalism, socialism, economics or even democracy falls apart like a house of cards in a hurricane. It is in fact impossible to comprehend the impact Bitcoin will have on the planet without also understanding basic Austrian economics and what the libertarian worldview stems from.</p><p>Imagine growing up in an Amish community. Until your sixteenth birthday you’re purposely completely shielded off from the outside world. Information about how the world really works is very limited to you, since internet access, and even TVs and radios, are forbidden within the community. Well, from a certain perspective, we’re all Amish. How money really works is never emphasized enough through traditional media or public educational institutions. Most people believe that the monetary system is somehow sound and fair when there’s overwhelming evidence to the contrary, all over the globe. Ask yourself, do you remember being taught about the origins of money in school? Me neither. I don’t believe that there’s some great, global conspiracy behind the fact that the ethics of money creation isn’t a school subject, but rather that plain old ignorance is to blame for the lack of such a subject primarily. As soon as their math-skill limit is reached, people seem to stop caring about numbers. The difference between a million and a billion seems lost on a depressingly large part of the world’s population. In the chapters ahead we’ll explore the pitfalls of central banking, how money pops into existence and how inflation keeps us all on a leash.</p><p>Paperback book version available here: www.amazon.com/dp/1090109911</p>♦<p>Bitcoin: Sovereignty through mathematics CHAPTER ONE was originally published in HackerNoon.com on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Fears over the declining block reward are overblown<p>Published Block: 576165</p><p>TL;DR — This article comprehensively addresses concerns around Bitcoin’s security model which is funded by the block subsidy and transaction fees. Key points:</p><ul><li>The larger the Bitcoin network grows, the more secure it becomes.</li><li>Over the long term, an organic security tradeoff will occur between the block subsidy and transaction fees. As network effect becomes larger, demand for block space increases, thus decreasing the need for a block subsidy. We have empirical evidence that this is occurring, and future projections look optimistic.</li><li>Bitcoin’s block space is a scarce and unique commodity. It will continue to accrue demand.</li><li>The bull market of 2017 wasn’t millions of consumers suddenly using blockchains to transfer money around the world and seeking to minimize transaction, exchange, volatility, and coordination fees.</li><li>The price elasticity of a Bitcoin transactor is high. Even in significantly higher fee environments Bitcoin block space demand will grow.</li></ul>medium.com/media/f5090077afe5faa10a6bf8db4958e779/hrefBlock Reward<p>Approximately every 10 minutes, a new Bitcoin block is created, which contains newly minted Bitcoins (the “block subsidy”) plus transactions (which includes transaction fees paid by the entity sending the transaction). The value of the newly minted coins plus transaction fees is called the “block reward.”</p><p>Per Bitcoin’s hard coded monetary policy, the amount of newly minted coins per block decreases over time, eventually reaching 0% in the year 2140 (also known as a disinflationary model). At the time of this article being published, over 83% of all Bitcoins that will ever exist have already been minted, and the current annual inflation rate is just 3.8%. Over 99% will be mined by 2040.</p><blockquote>“Indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don’t know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.” — Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote><p>Satoshi felt that setting a “proper” rate of inflation was impossible (due to the local knowledge problem) and that it introduced a political attack vector, so he decided to remove human decision making from the process. Each time monetary policy is changed or modified, human governance re-enters the system nullifying the certainty of monetary supply. This ultimately leads to less social scalability increasing the risk of network fragmentation and disagreements. A predictable monetary policy is key: Bitcoin’s focus on long-term stability and transparency creates confidence for investors and developers.</p><p>In other words, the fixed monetary policy in Bitcoin effectively and directly addresses a property rights problem: Without a hard supply cap it becomes uncertain what share of the total future stock any particular holder owns; as a result, variable supply policies almost always dilute individual ownership shares of money over time. Because supply caps solve this property rights problem, then those currencies tend to have increased value.</p><p>I won’t spend more time diving into Bitcoin’s monetary policy, as I consider that a separate topic which requires an article exclusively (which I will be releasing sometime in the next few months).</p><p>So why does this matter? The block reward incentivizes miners to protect the network. As inflation trends towards zero, miners will increasingly obtain an income only from transaction fees. Some worry that transaction fees alone won’t provide adequate compensation for the miners. In storing large sums of wealth, security and trust are critical.</p>♦plot.ly/~BashCo/5.embed?share_key=ljQVkaTiHXjX2W41UiqzCn Created by BashCoBitcoin’s Security Model<blockquote>“In a few decades when the reward gets too small, the transaction fee will become the main compensation for [miners].” — Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote><p>Bitcoin’s existing UTXO set (ledger) and new blocks are protected by game theory and physics. Bitcoin uses proof-of-work (PoW) to make changes to the ledger difficult, which eliminates trust and introduces an external cost for any would-be attacker. The miners buy hardware (capex) and electricity (opex) with the expectation of receiving their portion of the block reward based on work spent (hashes). The block reward financially incentivizes miners to behave properly.</p><p>As the price of BTC increases, the value of the block reward increases as well, which incentivizes miners to bring more hashrate online to mine. The higher the hash rate of a cryptocurrency network, the more expensive to 51% attack.</p><p>The security budget protects the network against 51% attacks which primarily occur on the tip of the blockchain, rather than an entire chain rewrite, which would require significantly more resources.</p><p>In the early stages of the network, Bitcoin miners are rewarded more heavily by the block subsidy than transaction fees. With Bitcoin’s disinflationary monetary policy, approximately every 4 years the block subsidy drops by 50%. This creates both volatility and a price increase: if demand remains constant (or increases), the reduction in supply means demand is chasing less freshly minted Bitcoins hitting the market. This effect brings in new speculators, which is part of the beauty in its design, as the supply shocks bring greater awareness to Bitcoin.</p><blockquote>“As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value.” — Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote>♦<p>While the two represent the same security budget, the block subsidy and transaction fees are very different. For the block subsidy, its value is both as a rational way to issue new Bitcoins and as a viral FOMO loop built into the protocol, which increases the number and network effect of believers in Bitcoin. It further stretches out the need for transaction fees to solely provide security. Hence why it’s called a “subsidy.”</p><p>Over the long term, an organic tradeoff will occur: as network effect becomes larger, demand for block space increases, thus decreasing the need for a block subsidy. While we don’t know why Satoshi chose Bitcoin’s issuance schedule specifically, we can speculate. Four years between halvenings is a long time to plan and build. In similar duration, we give a US President four years to make things happen for an entire nation.</p><p>With modeling done by Awe and Wonder we can see that around the year 2030 transaction fees will begin to consistently represent a healthy portion of the block reward. When transaction fees represent greater than 50% of the block reward for long periods of time (YoY), Bitcoin evolves to surviving more on transaction fees.</p>♦Chart and projections by Awe and Wonder. Y-axis is % of Bitcoin’s market cap daily.<p>Critics often argue that transaction fees alone won’t provide adequate security. But what is an appropriate security level? This is highly subjective since the amount of confirmations one would wait for depends on the transaction size and health of the network. However, despite the subjectivity, we should make an attempt to calculate it. At the MIT Bitcoin conference, Nic Carter presented several ways we could quantify an adequate security budget:</p><p>Threshold: At a given level of security spend, Bitcoin is assumed secure</p><p>Stock: Security spend should be indexed to the value of Bitcoin itself</p><p>Flow: Fees must be large relative to transactional volume</p><p>I personally believe security is best measured as a percentage of stock which eventually reaches a threshold level. Stock makes more sense than flow because miners will increasingly be focused on long term operations as ASIC efficiency diminishes. Eventually, this reaches a threshold level that will be extremely difficult to disrupt by even the most wealthy states.</p><p>I hypothesize several hundred billion, in present value USD, would be an adequate security budget since it would be very difficult for a government to justify such a waste of an expense to just 51% attack the tip of the Bitcoin blockchain. They would also have to respond publicly for such an attack as their citizens (taxpayers), businesses, and banks will all be invested in Bitcoin.</p><p>Note that a 51% attack wouldn’t “kill” Bitcoin, as you still cannot reverse historical transactions easily, the effort of which is calculated here.</p><blockquote>“This may also increase the value of the fee market as demand to move Bitcoin should increase, creating more incentive for non-attackers to service the fee market” — Neil Woodfine</blockquote><p>Finally, in the absolute worst case scenario of a sustained 51% attack, the thing that must be preserved is the UTXO set (ledger). If SHA256 must be abandoned, so be it. In that case, Bitcoin could fork onto a different mining algorithm that already has an established market — rendering all nation state mining equipment invalid. I want to be clear, this would be a last ditch effort, and by no means guaranteed to succeed, but the simple fact this could occur may dissuade a nation state from trying such an attack.</p><p>It’s important to note that PoW achieves other goals than just minimizing 51% attacks, and increasing network effect, it also ensures that money is provably costly to create (Unforgeable costliness).</p>medium.com/media/19d907005c726a1f060ffc1a245a47d6/hrefBitcoin’s block space is a scarce and unique commodity<p>There is no alternative to prime real estate</p><p>Getting a transaction mined can be seen as purchasing a portion of a block. By analogy, on average every 10 minutes, a fixed amount of land is created, people wanting to make transactions bid for parcels of this land. The sale of this land is what supports the miners even in a zero-inflation environment. The price of this land is set by demand for transactions because the supply is fixed and known. The basic premise is that if the network is being used/valued then it will reward miners for validation/protecting the network.</p><p>Some argue that altcoin block space is an equal substitute. However, there are many ways we can debunk that theory. Bitcoin real estate is prime real estate (ex: it doesn’t matter how cheap land is in Midland, Texas, it’ll never have the views or social network of San Francisco and therefore will have less demand). The unique value of Bitcoin’s block space is due to security, exchange, volatility, and coordination costs.</p><p>This following section borrows heavily from Donald McIntyre’s article “Observations About Paul Sztorc’s Bitcoin “Security Budget in the Long Run” Essay” (I have his permission to use large directly quoted sections without quotations so the article could have more continuity)</p><p>Security costs: Bitcoin is the most secure cryptocurrency network due to the total accumulated hashes (energy). This will create a market for high value, highly secure transfers in Bitcoin, e.g. central banks, governments, interbank, corporate and other large value payment users, who will gladly pay very high fees. There is also a security feedback loop as other chains borrow Bitcoin’s strong security by making on chain transactions, as we’ve recently seen with Veriblock.</p><p>Exchange costs: When senders and receivers want to store value in Bitcoin, but need to transfer them, there is friction to move from BTC to an altcoin, send it for a lower fee, and then pass it back to Bitcoin on the other side. Between exchange commissions (0.1–4%), spreads (since alts are less liquid), and transaction fees both ways, there will be an indifference point beyond which it will be better to pay for Bitcoin fees. If Bitcoin is a very good store of value, transfers will occur within Bitcoin precisely for the same reason it is a good store of value.</p><p>Volatility costs: Often people forget to consider volatility costs which depends on your holding period. Altcoins typically have higher volatility than Bitcoin which has the nasty effect of scaling with transaction size. A hypothetical example:</p><p>LTC: $10 payment + 10% vol + 0.01 fee = $1.01</p><p>BTC: $10 payment + 1% vol + 0.20 fee = $0.30</p><p>LTC: $100 payment + 10% vol + 0.05 fee = $10.05</p><p>BTC: $100 payment + 1% vol + $1.00 fee = $2.00</p><p>While Bitcoin fees hypothetically increased 5x, the volatility loss on LTC made the transaction fee ~$10! Conversely, even if you make money on the volatility, you still will have to pay capital gains. Below is a chart which shows average fee and volatility for BTC, LTC, and ETH. Unfortunately, without an average individual holding period for multiple coins, it would be difficult to calculate the average cost of volatility.</p>♦<p>Coordination costs: Not all coins will survive. There will be a limited competing block space market in the world. This is because our minds are limited and we will not think about 250 cryptocurrency names, transfer fees, the subsequent 250 prices, and go about selecting the cheapest one each time we move value (@NickSzabo4). Our brains will only support understanding the value of 2 to 3 coins at most, and we will be comfortable using them interchangeably up to a certain point (although there is a weak/unproven case to be made for obfuscating a plethora of coins behind proper UX/UI). Additionally, since Bitcoin HODLers have a strong affinity to only transact in Bitcoin (monotheistic), multicoiners will be forced to transact in Bitcoin (Tyranny of the minority). For example: Square, Bakkt, and Fidelity are only supporting Bitcoin at this time.</p><p>Finally, the Bitcoin core software is battled hardened with a mature ecosystem. This adds value to Bitcoin’s unique block space since there are more developers and businesses that examine and rely on Bitcoin’s code.</p><blockquote>“Bitcoin is money. Multicoinery is barter.” — Conner Brown</blockquote><p>With all of these considerations above, there will be a limited amount of coins in the future, with a limited amount of block space and transaction capacity. This means that the cost of sending value will be distributed between the surviving chains in proportion to value and safety requirements. But in the end every altcoin is offering a lower security model with a higher risk.</p><blockquote>“If one chain becomes the most secure by far, why would the majority of wealth and valuable apps not be secured by it? As more users buy into more secure chains, their buying pressure will push up the price. The increased price will lead to increased security. From there, eventually usage, liquidity, and network efforts will compound on each other. These most valuable and secure chains should then be used to secure the most wealth and valuable dapps. Less valuable blockchains with the same security model of their more expensive counterparts will become less and less used as the gap in security grows. Sidechains, layer 2 systems, etc. will make the ‘differentiating features’ of alternate chains less and less relevant.” — Alex Sunnarborg</blockquote><blockquote>“The sudden multiplication of altcoins and ICOs during the last bull run was a race to mimic the wealth creation that happened in Bitcoin. It was not millions of people suddenly using blockchains to transfer money around the world and seeking to minimize those fees. In other words, the coincidence of altcoin and ICO proliferation with the 2017 crypto bubble was a generalized gold rush (we were all trying to find gold/SoV) but not a rational pricing dynamic and arbitrage of block space through transaction fees.” — Donald McIntyre</blockquote><p>Although I have little data to back this statement up (and it’s quite subjective), I think a large portion of payments were likely done for novelty. Paying for something with crypto is harder, more expensive, and slower than traditional payment methods. After all, Bitcoin’s base layer is for building the strongest possible foundation for a new global monetary system–not creating another Venmo.</p>♦(If I had used the query “bitcoin” then “spend bitcoin” didn’t even register on the chart)♦(Users aren’t looking to pay for items with any cryptocurrency, otherwise we would have seen an up trend despite the price volatility)Transactional Demand<blockquote>“I’m sure that in 20 years there will either be very large transaction volume or no volume.” — Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote><p>Another worry is that as fees become higher users will shy away from transactions to avoid fees. However, we’ve seen empirically this is not the case: as transaction/trading volume has increased, fees follow in step.</p>♦(log)Price Elasticity<blockquote>“Nobody goes there anymore. It’s too crowded.” — Yogi Berra</blockquote><p>Consider the user experience for most North American, European, and Asian consumers/businesses (the majority of crypto participants). In most cases, any transaction fee has a higher level of friction than existing payment methods, so any fee is deemed “expensive” (vs cash or credit card).</p><blockquote>“Think of the fees like insurance. You’re paying for security.” — Ari Paul</blockquote><p>The price elasticity (for fees) of a Bitcoin transactor is largely due to the nature of the payment type being sent, an immutable SoV. During the point of highest congestion in 2017, the median fee was $38. And during that time period, we briefly saw blocks with fees being greater than the subsidy. For comparables we can look at cost of transacting a SoV:</p><p>Wiring Fiat</p><p>For US banks, the average domestic wire fee is $30–40, and $65–80 for international (both incoming and outgoing fees combined).</p><p>Offshore ($7T Market)</p><p>“The setup fee for opening an offshore bank account is between…. $1,935 to $3,745 for [a bank account and an entity filing]” — Offshore Banking Primer</p><p>Real Estate ($250T Market)</p><p>“Buyers from China bought 40,400 units totaling $30.4 billion between April 2017 and March 2018. They spent a median of $439,100 per purchase” — National Association of Realtors</p><p>Average closing costs on a home are 2% of the value, or $8,000. I’m sure individuals will be fine paying $50 in the future to send an immutable payment with an asset that can’t be easily taken away from them (unlike real estate which could be seized in a geopolitical quarrel at the snap of a finger).</p><p>Physical Gold Delivery ($7.5T Market)</p><p>Donald McIntyre requested information from the Bundesbank regarding their NY Fed transfer of 300 metric tons of gold ($12 Billion at the time) from NYC to Frankfurt. It took 3 years and cost $4.8 million.</p><p>With smaller sizes, gold delivery may require insurance, verified shipping, or physical protection during pickup/delivery, etc. Estimated to be around $10-$100 at a minimum.</p>Increasing Transactional Density<p>Nic Carter’s MIT presentation highlighted two ways to improve transactional demand: increase economic or semantic density of transactions. Semantic Density is about having other blockchains imbed their data into the Bitcoin blockchain, like Veriblock. Economic density is about increasing transaction types on Layer 1, which are the following:</p><p>Privacy</p><blockquote>“Schnorr can enable the creation of new transactions types that break the heuristics widely used in blockchain analysis, and make it nearly impossible to pinpoint specific entities by simply looking at the blockchain while simultaneously allowing greater transaction density per block by aggregating signatures.” — Lucas Nuzzi</blockquote><p>Layer 2 (ex: Lightning)</p><p>As Bitcoin scales (Schnorr on Layer 1, Lightning on Layer 2, etc), it will become more and more efficient, driving higher on-chain usage. Jevon’s Paradox intuitively predicts this — as cars have become more fuel efficient, more miles are driven annually. Layer 2 will support a massive number of cheap smaller transactions, whereas Layer 1 represents a more expensive settlement layer for large transactions (container ships vs cargo containers — Nic Carter). LN boosts on-chain fees by increasing the utility of each on-chain txn (by allowing each to do the work of many txns), and by therefore making high on-chain fees more tolerable to the end user.</p><p>As businesses and Lapps are built around the Lightning network, a big part of their opex will be channel management. That will ensure constant demand for Layer 1 settlement as these operators rebalance channels and optimize connectivity &amp; capacity. On-chain, block space is premium, hence transactions are charged for the space it takes to register the transfer. Off-chain, liquidity is premium, hence transactions are charged for the amount being transferred over the channels (as it requires rebalancing). In other words, on-chain and off-chain transactions have different fee models that complement each other. On-chain, the fee is constant despite transaction value, whereas off-chain the fee is priced as a percent of the value transfer. There is a crossover point where high value transactions cost more to use on Lightning than Layer 1.</p><p>We’ve already seen evidence that Lightning is increasing layer 1 usage, even in its highly experimental form. There was a block created in February 2019 which was 25% full with lightning transactions to open a channel. This was detectable because Lightning uses the SegWit malleability fix, all LN channel opens are SegWit transactions.*</p>♦“The nodes in the lightning network gossip information about which (public) channels exist in the network, including a reference to the funding tx, which we check to make sure the announcement is real. Which is an underestimate as there are also some number of private/unadvertised channels.” — Snyke<p>Quantum resistance</p><blockquote>“The adoption of quantum resistant techniques will also result in larger (and more expensive) transactions. Post-quantum crypto algorithms require larger key sizes, which in turn increase the size of non-witness data in a transaction.”— Lucas Nuzzi</blockquote><p>Overall</p><p>We have empirical evidence that total fee revenue will slowly trend up to equal the block subsidy in the coming decades. Based on this data, fears that the transaction fee won’t replace the block subsidy are definitively overblown.</p><p>The chart below shows transaction fees as a percentage of the block subsidy.</p>♦Chart and projections by Awe and Wonder. Y-axis is transaction fees as % of block subsidy.<p>As Alex Sunnarborg pointed out, only Bitcoin and Ethereum have meaningful enough transaction fees to compensate miners in a no inflation environment. It is very unlikely that any other network will be able to compete.</p>♦Data from CoinMetrics, Chart initially compiled by Alex SunnarborgSecurity Stability<p>“The volatility of fees, which seem to behave nonlinearly as blocks become full. Might lead to corresponding big swings in hashrate.” — Nick Szabo</p><p>Scarce block space is a good thing since we will see a backlog of transactions, which demonstrates future intent to reward miners, which in turn stabilizes the system. Congestion in 2017 demonstrated that the system can create and sustain a backlog.</p><p>A legitimate concern is that in a pure transaction fee security model, there will be volatility in cash flows. Transaction fees are market-centered, meaning that they go up and down adjusting to supply and demand. The base assumption is that cash flows from transaction fees will be unstable which makes the network less secure. Dan Mcardle sums it up nicely:</p><blockquote>“As mining becomes highly commoditized with mature corporations, miners are unlikely to play short-run games, but will rather choose to mine continuously. Taking this further, as miners will likely vertically integrate with other services (ex: OTC) that become additional profit centers (meaning they’re not as concerned about the possible games to play on a block-by-block basis)” — Dan Mcardle</blockquote><p>Miners like stable cash flows, hence why they join mining pools. They don’t play short term games trying to win a block, they socialize the winnings.</p><p>Given the worst case scenario where mining fees are unstable, it doesn’t actually undermine the system, it just makes settlement time longer until fees grow large enough for mining to turn back on. Entities, by necessity of time preference, would increase fees in response, countering.</p><p>Moreover, the subsidy has already been incredibly volatile in real terms over the past few years and mining has remained strong and constant–even with 80% drawdowns in the value of the subsidy. This “instability” has not affected the network and mining will continue to become even more resilient to large swings as the market continues to mature.</p><p>In the future, miners might auction space in future blocks in advance which could have a stabilizing effect on their revenue (the same way farmers sell crop futures). The basic premise is that if there is increasing usage of Bitcoin, the free market for future block space will price it correctly.</p><p>Finally, if this is a major issue that isn’t corrected by the market naturally, there are minor changes we can make in the protocol to smooth fee revenue. However, this would make the base protocol more complicated, and the game theory behind it hasn’t been adequately explored. For example:</p><blockquote>“Other longer term low subsidy era ideas include fee averaging across block intervals to smooth fee revenue.” — Adam Back</blockquote>Modeling Security Post Subsidy<p>What do transaction fees in a post block subsidy world look like? I built a model that would help us think through what they might be in the year 2140 (in today’s dollars), with a few necessary assumptions that you can view for yourself below. In its most congested state in the year 2140, a transaction on layer 1 may only cost between $8 — $82 depending on Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Transacting on layer 1 will be an infrequent occurrence for most consumers, just like wiring money.</p>$10T Market Cap♦You can play around with the model here if you’d like to plug in your own assumptions.$100T Market Cap♦You can play around with the model here if you’d like to plug in your own assumptions.Assumptions<p>Hyperbitcoinization</p><p>Bitcoin survives, thrives, and continues to grow in market share exponentially, as it has done the last 10 years. I’ve chosen Bitcoin’s max market cap in hyperbitcoinization value to be between $10T (value a bit higher than gold) and $100T, which has been a popular estimate for bulls. To put this value in perspective:</p><p>Total wealth in the world: $750T</p><p>Real Estate: $225T</p><p>Fiat: $50T-100T</p><p>Gold: $7.5T</p><p>Block size</p><p>Block size is constrained by latency, bandwidth, and storage. Without fundamentally changing how packet routing works, or advancing speed of transfers improvement in latency, picking a growth rate just based on bandwidth or storage increases isn’t the correct way to look at it (Another consideration with latency is usability with Tor). We have to look at the issues with larger blocks size holistically.</p><p>Certainly, a larger block size would alleviate some of the explicit fee pressure felt by transactors (thereby decreasing public scrutiny by ill-informed critics, and perceived “cost” for transactors). However, that offsets the cost onto node operators, simultaneously decreasing decentralization in some manner, which is what makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place. Also, this increases mining pool centralization. What level of centralization is allowable is a continuing debate in the Bitcoin community.</p><p>There is a case to be made for a market mechanism that would compensate node operators. For example: prompt relays, transaction data, SLAs, etc. However, it is mostly theoretical at the moment.</p><p>If a rate of block size increase is decided on, it should have a decreasing growth rate (similar to Bitcoin’s inflation rate). Otherwise, we are going to have to agree to softfork a smaller limit in later, which is the exact opposite of the position we want to be in. Some research has shown that 8MB might be the largest block size possible without material detrimental effects.</p><p>And finally, there have been some discussions around decreasing block time, which would provide the ability to further increase block size.</p><p>Layer 1 Efficiency</p><p>With Schnorr signatures (soon to be implemented), it is estimated that this upgrade would reduce the use of storage and bandwidth by at least 25%. We can assume some additional efficiency gains will occur over the next 120 years (Taprooft/Graftroof on the immediate horizon).</p><p>In the chart below, we can see that transaction fees as % of market cap trend towards a little above 0.001% daily over the next decade. Even with the continual decline of the block subsidy, total mining revenue (ie security) has increased exponentially as Bitcoin gains further adoption.</p>♦Chart and projections by Awe and Wonder. Left Y-axis is daily mining revenue in USD. Right Y-axis is transaction fees/block subsidy as % of market cap.<p>TPS</p><p>Assuming that current Layer 1 is 20 TPS max w/ Segwit. TPS depends on the byte size of the transaction but I had to choose a value to build the model.</p>Flawed Potential Solutions<p>Proposals for increasing the 21M hard cap, or “unlocking” dormant coins, aren’t appropriate to bring up at this stage for three reasons:</p><ul><li>Lack of evidence that the decreasing block subsidy will be an issue</li><li>The divisiveness of the ask due to its ethical tradeoffs</li><li>More palatable fixes if there is an issue at least a decade from now</li></ul>Conclusion<p>I’ve addressed what an adequate level of security could be, Bitcoin’s prime (and unreplicable) block space, transactional demand, what happens when the subsidy runs out, and security stability. We have empirical evidence that there will be proper security budget financing will equilibrate through fees. The tradeoff is always between inflation (block subsidy) and fees and Bitcoin is the best positioned to charge fees reliably. If there is no economic (transaction) volume in 10 years bitcoin will have failed anyway.</p><p>Most well-pedigreed critics predicting doom and gloom used absurd assumptions in their models. Conversely, Cypherpunks write code.</p><p>Satoshi was essentially an academic that wrote production code, and published working models in the environment first focusing on practical implications.</p><p>His experiment, Bitcoin, has worked for 10 years despite an intensely hostile environment — all data indicates we have reason to believe it will continue to thrive.</p><p>This article is part of a new set of research content that is going to be put out by my company Interchange, which is a middle to back office accounting solution for crypto companies (ex: fund admins, OTC desks, and fund managers).

  <p>Totally agree. I was about to respond with this same idea. Bitcoin blockspace is different from the monetary unit.</p>♦

  <p>Money is an evolutionary process. As Bitcoin sucks up value from traditional assets, then you’re absolutely right! You shouldn’t spend until Bitcoin has finished accumulating value. Only then, when Bitcoin is an extremely large and liquid asset that has evolved past its store of value phase, should it be used a medium of exchange.</p><p>Every money must evolve in this way. A money cannot suddenly come into existence as a functioning store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account simultaneously. That would be impossible! Instead, those functions are developed in stages.</p>♦

  <p>This is the text of the talk I gave on May 12, 2019 at the Magical Crypto Conference in New York City.</p><p>My name is Jimmy Song and I teach Bitcoin development. Just as a show of hands, how many of you have read the whitepaper? How many of you know how to code? How many of you have contributed to an open source project? How many of you have contributed to Bitcoin Core?</p>♦<p>My goal here today is to inspire you to understand Bitcoin better and take you from one level to the next. I’ll do that through some of the insights I’ve gained by teaching over 500 people and make it applicable to you by showing you what’s effective in your journey toward understanding.</p>The Class<p>The first thing to learn about my class is why people take it. One reason is because Bitcoin is rather intimidating. The impression that a lot of people get is that Bitcoin is a super-security conscious network where a small screw-up could lead to a lot of money loss. That would be correct. The security implications and rather daunting for someone starting out and having someone guide them in their learning is a huge incentive.</p><p>Another reason is because Bitcoin is difficult to understand. It’s not an easy technology and most people have a hard time learning on their own. I’ve had people tell me that they spent 6–18 months trying to learn the technology on their own before giving up and taking my course.</p><p>The last reason is because a lot of people want the motivation of taking the course to get them into gear. The investment that people need to make in terms of time and money is quite a lot and that helps people get into the right state of mind to take the learning seriously.</p><p>I encountered all of these issues when I was getting started coding in Bitcoin, back in 2013. Back then, the documentation was sparse and any sort of learning platform, non-existent. One of the reasons I created this class and wrote my book was to help developers not suffer as I did.</p><p>The structure of my class is a 2-day workshop that consist of 8 hour days. The one major exception to this was a half-semester graduate class I taught at the University of Texas, which was split up into 7 weeks for 2.5 hours each. Since some of that class time was spent on exams, the total number of hours ended up being about the same. The students code a library for themselves that does a lot of what any Bitcoin library would do. They are positioned to learn together with peers that are basically starting from the same place.</p>Read<p>The first learning is that most people think they know more than they do. It’s easy enough to talk about concepts, but presenting the details usually results in some real light bulb moments. Here’s one student’s evaluation of the course:</p><blockquote>To be honest, if it wasn’t for the scholarship I would never have considered attending Programming Blockchain. More than the cost, I arrogantly thought that having a computer science background meant that I somehow already understood Bitcoin or that I could always fill in the gaps with a bit of light reading. How would a two day seminar help?</blockquote><blockquote>Oh man what a wake up call! Within a few short minutes of sitting down, reality set in. The scope of the task ahead was made clear. We were to digest a semester’s worth of new material in two days whilst solving programming puzzles at unrelenting pace. The average technical ability was insanely high and I felt like the dunce of the class!</blockquote><blockquote>It was a indeed a huge challenge, but one that was immensely satisfying. Each puzzle would build upon the previous ones, until we finally built up enough layers of understanding to create, parse and verify transactions and blocks with our own code. Now we can build our very own wallets!</blockquote><p>The second learning is that near everyone is surprised by how much they learn in two days. We cover a lot of material, though, to be clear, we only really cover a small portion of all that goes into Bitcoin. The reason people are able to do this are three-fold.</p><p>First, because people are setting aside two days and in a setting where this is the only thing that they’re doing, they are truly focused on the task at hand. Yes, people still check their email and social media accounts between sessions, but sitting in a classroom for 8 hours with no other responsibilities really helps.</p><p>Second, because people have to code, the lectures really harden. The implementing helps students get a good grasp of what was just learned in concept.</p><p>Third, because they have peers, there’s a desire to keep up. Much like how crossfit incentivizes people into putting more effort than they would alone, being in a classroom setting motivates people to keep up with everyone else.</p><p>What does this mean for you? Well, first, if you want to understand Bitcoin, you’re going to have to do some reading/watching/listening. This could range from the most basic concepts to the most critical code. Why should you do this? As I’ll make clear later, this is really good for your investment! And finally, if you want to really absorb the information, you’re going to have to set aside time to really focus.</p>Code<p>The next learning I want to emphasize is that concept is not code. The example here is of public key cryptography. Most people, at a high level understand that only a private key can create a signature and a public key can verify it, but do they really understand how it works? Most don’t. Implementing the code requires a much deeper understanding of the concept to make things work. What I’ve noticed with my students is that they have some general idea of how something works when they come in and a bit more when I lecture, but they don’t really understand until they code.</p><p>The beauty of coding is that there are no ambiguities. You can’t hand wave over anything. You have to be clear in what you mean and be precise in what you ask the computer to do. That level of rigor is helpful to understand what’s going on.</p><p>This in turn leads to appreciation for the coders that actually implement Bitcoin. Core developers are held in high esteem already, but learning about various concepts and how they’re implemented inspires gratitude. For example, UTXOs are a concept that many people know, but when students learn about how transactions are constructed, they gain a true appreciation of how elegant a solution Satoshi made to make keeping track of the ledger simple.</p><p>Another such example are Merkle Proofs. When students learn how you can prove a transaction is in a set without knowing the entire set, they’re surprised at its cleverness. The forethought involved in adding the Merkle Root to the block header is something students really start to appreciate.</p><p>Lastly, Segwit really tends to blow peoples’ minds. Generally, their reaction is, “Why was this so controversial?”. They see how it helps the network and cleverly makes things backwards compatible and how it really doesn’t break any precedents since they learn about pay-to-script-hash beforehand.</p><p>What does this mean for you? At the risk of getting banned from Twitter, learn to code! Not only is this good for your Bitcoin investment, but it’s great for your career. If you think that only programmers take my class, you would be wrong. I’ve had accountants, hedge fund managers, project managers and many other professions take my course. Knowing the bare metal, so to speak, helps in almost any endeavor involving technology and this is definitely true of Bitcoin. How do you get started? Find a group to learn with. This will help the same way that a yoga class or a crossfit class helps you get fit. You can hack your inner social animal to your advantage.</p>Teach<p>And this segways nicely into my next point. People learn a lot better in groups. Part of the reason is because you have peers that can help you. This helps both the helper and the helpee. The helpee obviously gets another explanation from another perspective. The helper is forced to articulate the knowledge in a clear way that another person can understand.</p><p>This is why I believe diversity in a classroom helps a lot. For a long time, my classes were mostly men. This is to be expected, I’m male and I generally know best how to market to people in my demographic. When Elizabeth Stark started helping me recruit women for some scholarships, I noticed something. First, the classes were a lot more fun to teach. Different perspectives mean that you get questions phrased differently. I’m forced to explain things in more complete ways as a result. Second, I noticed the students enjoyed the class more, too. The group dynamics in a learning environment seem to get better with more diversity. My favorite class that I’ve taught happened a year ago here in New York City. Due to Elizabeth’s recruiting efforts, we had a diverse group of 37 students.</p><p>After the two-day class we usually go for a drink nearby to unwind a little. We hang out, have a good time and talk about Bitcoin. What I noticed about the New York class is that we hung out for a good 6 hours after the class. Everyone enjoyed being with each other so much that we just kept hanging out!</p><p>Lastly, it turns out a lot of students enjoy explaining to others. Justin Moen, Stepan Snigirev, Pierre Rochard, Hugo Nguyen are all known in the industry for their explanations and teaching. They’re all alumni of my course. Each has found that explaining Bitcoin to others is a great way to learn themselves.</p><p>What does this mean for you? Well, teach! As they say, if you really want to learn something, teach it. Teaching forces you to learn the topic thoroughly as we all want to avoid embarrassment. But more subtly, it helps us to practice defending Bitcoin against attack.</p><p>There are so many ridiculous claims by altcoiners out there. For example, Ryan X Charles recently claimed that lightning nodes are money transmitters. Helping educate others through teaching helps people understand what’s going on.</p><p>How can you do this? Go to a local Bitcoin meetup and ask to present. Or use Medium to write an article. The level of rigor required for creating teaching material will really help you understand Bitcoin.</p>Conclusion<p>So here are some takeaways for you. First, realize that understanding Bitcoin is hard. Yes, Bitcoin is simpler and more secure than altcoins, but it’s still not easy to understand. What you think you understand, you can always understand better.</p><p>Second, understand Bitcoin deeper through reading/coding/teaching. This is not only good for you, as you’ll understand your investment better, but also good for the ecosystem.</p><p>Which brings me to my next point. The ecosystem is you! The traditional centralized way of running things is all based on trust. Trust ends up being about credibility, and in a darker way, about discrediting others. This generally leads to a lot of politicization of said entity as someone that can play that game usually ends up taking control.</p><p>This is the path that altcoins are going down. Ethereum, for example, has set up a cult of personality around Vitalik. Their system is so hopelessly complex and so few people understand how it works that very few people even bother setting up a full node. Instead of looking at new features critically, they end up trusting whatever Vitalik says. In other words, they’re trusting, not verifying.</p><p>Bitcoin is about verifying, not trusting. Many of us run full nodes so we can verify the transactions ourselves. That’s what makes the network decentralized. It’s also important to make the understanding of Bitcoin decentralized as well. Instead of trusting such-and-such person, we should be able to evaluate what they’re saying. That’s how we stay decentralized, by making Bitcoin a real meritocracy with critical evaluation of the code.</p><p>Now that said, this doesn’t mean that you need to understand the subtleties of possible security breaches in every line of code. I just want you guys to take one step toward verifying and one step away from trusting. In other words, I want you to level up! Only by understanding better yourself will we get stronger as a community. Thank you.</p><p>Some books you can read to start on this journey are my book, Andreas’s book, Grokking Bitcoin, Inventing Bitcoin, The Bitcoin Standard and Bitcoin Money.</p>♦

  ♦Source: WikimediaARPANET’s First Mark into Networked Computing<p>Created in February 1958, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) was a response to the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1, the first artificial Earth satellite, to research and develop projects in technology and science, beyond direct US military applications.</p><p>Bob Taylor, an ARPA computer scientist convinced a colleague to support a research project using funding from a ballistic missile defense program. Following three years of research, the ARPANET project was launched as the first network to connect two geographically-distinct computers.</p><p>In 1969, on October 29th at 10:30 PM PST, the first successful message ‘ LO’ was sent from UCLA in Los Angeles to Stanford in Silicon Valley. The message was supposed to be ‘ LOGIN’ but the system crashed. Over 7 years later, Queen Elizabeth II was sending her first email from a computer installed in the UK.</p><p>The ARPANET was morphing into a small but fast-growing global network of connected computers.</p>Rising Computer Network Protocols<p>The ARPANET was the first public implementation of TCP/IP, two major protocols that now form an integral part of the Internet Protocol Suite. Taken together, this suite constitutes what we know as “the Internet”, the global interconnected network that hundreds of millions of humans use daily without ever being aware of it.</p><p>As additional computer nodes joined the ARPANET in different countries, novel technologies were developed to make the growing network more usable, notably standard network protocols.</p><p>Public computer protocols were created to govern how data is created, exchanged and interpreted between clients and servers on the same interconnected network, including Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) to send and receive emails, File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to exchange and read files or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to structure and display web pages that we browse today.</p><p>HTTP is one of the most well-known public protocols. It turned ARPANET into the World Wide Web that is now commonly called the Internet or the web and established a standard for computers to communicate on the application layer of the Internet, having built on other layers of public protocols and open-source technologies.</p>The Internet’s Onion Shape<p>The Internet is built in layers, abstracted in a framework called the Open Interconnection System (OSI) model. It is a logical construction that defines network communication used by various computer systems that interact with each other.</p><p>As the Internet morphed into a more sophisticated global network of computers, the OSI model was published to help decouple seven distinct layers of public protocols useful in the creation, exchange and interpretation of data flows.</p><p>As a hierarchical system, public computer network protocols coordinate how data moves across the Internet’s seven layers. Each layer is solely responsible for performing assigned tasks and transferring completed tasks to the next layer for further processing.</p><p>This clear specialization ensures performance, reliability and scalability of the Internet.</p>♦Source: Cloud Scanner<p>The Internet is a multi-layered global distributed network of computers that we use every day for many things without ever questioning its existence. Though only 20 years old, the Internet powers an immense amount of trades between an ever-growing number of consumers, companies and nations, accounting for roughly $28 trillion in 2016.</p><p>Long before Amazon was a thing, in 1972, students from Stanford and MIT conducted the first ever online transaction using ARPANET. The first good ever sold on the Internet was marijuana.</p><p>Many projects followed as commercial and academic attempts to create electronic cash making commerce native on the Internet. All incommensurably failed from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, including B-money, Digicash, Hashcash, and BitGold.</p><p>Technology, regulation and centralisation prevented mainstream digital currencies from ever taking off.</p>The Missing ‘Monetary Layer’ of the Internet<p>Regardless, for users to directly trade with geographically-distinct neighbours on the Internet, one essential component has been absent: a monetary layer to store, exchange and measure value natively on the web without being required to use legacy financial institutions.</p><p>Over two decades, failed attempts at creating digital money paved the way to a reckoning and the silent launch of an open-source software project on a cypherpunk mailing list, back in 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto was the unknown pseudonym who posted about the Bitcoin project with a link to its white paper explaining how it works.</p><p>It was initially understood as yet another doomed attempt to construct a digital currency by the disillusioned cypherpunk community. Without anyone’s permission, Bitcoin slowly emerged and diligently grew to be adopted by a small group of computer researchers, cryptographers and engineers curious to decipher the technology.</p>♦Source: Bitcoin P2P E-Cash Paper Mailing List<p>Fast forward 10 years, Bitcoin proved to be resilient to attacks, bugs and serious technical or political crises. There are hundreds of developers actively working on this project worth billions of dollars of market capitalization.</p><p>Bitcoin’s latest running software ( 0.17.1 released in December 2018) has created and maintained the world’s first form of digital scarcity. Without ever breaking the integrity of its underlying ledger, it does not rely on trusted third parties to verify everything is running well.</p><p>Everyone and anyone can take the role of verification. This had never been achieved in the past. Bitcoin solved a multi-decades long problem in computer science called the Byzantine Generals’ Problem.</p>BTC/LN as Public Network Protocols<p>Bitcoin is growing into the Internet’s native monetary layer. Functioning as a suite of public network protocols, BTC/LN, Bitcoin has undeniably scarce units of value. It is a network of storable, movable and quantifiable value.</p><p>As a self-contained economic system on the Internet, Bitcoin is powered by energy and protected by a global network of computing power that voluntarily regulates the integrity of Bitcoin’s ledger and its digitally-scarce monetary units. That self-organized configuration is unbreakable and decentralized like the internet itself.</p><p>Bitcoin and its Lightning Network (BTC/LN) are joining the ranks of other open network protocols akin to TCP/IP. Bitcoin (BTC) has movable units of scarce value that can flow within its network, similar to the Internet Protocol (IP).</p><p>The Lightning Network (LN) acts as a second layer built on top of BTC, which permits nearly instant, friction-free, and anonymous exchange of smaller units of BTC, similar to the Transfer Communication Protocol (TCP).</p><p>BTC/LN is the suite of protocols responsible for the rise of a native monetary layer of the Internet, adding a division to the OSI model’s current stack. Bitcoin represents the world’s first bytes of data with an intrinsic financial value priced by the physical world, in the form of energy and perceived market value.</p><p>Software now has a built-in price tag. Code is valuable without any specific application because of its remarkable scarcity. Scarcity isn’t a concept that is limited by physical boundaries anymore. Scarcity can provably be digital. It now exists in the most intangible form-bytes-digital binary digits.</p>A Silent Monetary Evolution<p>Bitcoin is agnostic of any traditional institutions such as governments, central banks or for-profit corporations. Internet users can simply acquire, trade and use bitcoins as they see fit. No single entity controls its protocol. It is governed by open-source software, which is voluntarily run by tens of thousands of independent computers.</p><p>Computers in the network play two roles around Bitcoin’s ledger, called the Timechain, by either writing or reading transactions. Bitcoin’s Timechain is a chain of blocks, which transcribes a suite of bundled transactions that are recorded by one set of computers: miners.</p><p>Often coined ‘the blockchain’, which is for other cryptocurrencies trying to mimic Bitcoin, the Timechain is more accurate to describe Bitcoin’s ledger as it ties to the original semantic used by Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakomoto.</p>A Free Market of Rational Volunteers<p>Miners are powerful computers with specialized hardware dedicated towards writing transactions to Bitcoin’s ledger. In a collective computational contest, vast amounts of energy are expensed by miners to brute-force random alphanumeric strings in an effort to guess a random code. It’s akin to a digital lottery.</p><p>Bitcoin miners’ contributions to the network are measured as hash rate, which is a function of computational power.</p>♦Source: Bitcoin Miners Beware: Invalid Blocks Need Not Apply<p>Once that random code, called a ‘nonce’ is found by a computer in the network, it proves that the miner has completed enough work in the form of energy and time expended. This is commonly referred to as Proof of Work, which allows all computers in the Bitcoin network to verify that the system stays fair and honest.</p><p>The lucky computer, or mining pool as they often combine computing power for efficiency, can then gather a batch of unconfirmed transactions from a queue called the ‘mempool’ and bundle them into a block to permanently write that block of transactions into Bitcoin’s ledger.</p><p>To be granted permission to write on Bitcoin’s ledger, there is no shortcut such as political influence, hierarchy or seniority. Each participant adding information to Bitcoin’s ledger needs to earn it through proven work that they must show to the network using the random nonce.</p><p>In return for their service to the network, miners receive a ‘block reward’ with new bitcoins, including transaction fees that users previously paid to have their transactions recorded. This is the only way for new bitcoins to be created. It must be earned via provable energy expenditure.</p><p>Since 2018, Bitcoin has shifted the world into an era of exahash computing. If one were to gather the 500 top supercomputers, altogether they would only represent 1.6% of Bitcoin’s hashrate. It is dwarfing the world’s computing horsepower by multiple orders of magnitude, creating a robust computational defense mechanism, preventing malicious actors from controlling the network and double spending bitcoins using the majority of the hashrate ( often called a 51% attack).</p>A Self-Managed Computing Organism<p>Bitcoin’s ledger is secured and managed by cryptography. On average, a new block of transactions is added every 10 minutes, no matter what. Each time, this creates new bitcoins on the network, in the form of a block subsidy for the lucky miners.</p><p>The block subsidy used to be 50 bitcoins, which got cut in half in 2012, in 2016, and soon will be cut in half again in 2020, bringing the next block subsidy down to 6.25 bitcoins. This process is called halving.</p><p>Halving events happen every 210,000 blocks that are added to Bitcoin’s ledger. It is the only rule that controls the issuance of new bitcoins. It will continue roughly every 4 years until all 21 million bitcoins are mined, which should happen approximately in the year 2140.</p><p>The creation rate of new bitcoins slows down over time, until it ultimately turns to zero. No new bitcoins will be created after that moment. As new adoption increases demand, bitcoins’ price goes up too. Opportunistically, new computers are attracted to the Bitcoin network to mine blocks of transactions and receive the valuable block reward.</p><p>As more computers join the network and produce larger collective hashrate, Bitcoin is automatically adjusting the difficulty of the mining lottery. Roughly every 2 weeks, or 2,016 blocks, mining either becomes harder or easier based on how much hashrate there is.</p><p>It is the most reliable way to have new blocks mined roughly every 10 minutes, which keeps new bitcoins’ issuance highly stable and predictable, regardless of the network’s collective hash rate.</p>Towards Universal Financial Integrity<p>Since its first block mined on January 3rd, 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin has been up 99.98% of the time, and has never validated a malicious or wrong transaction, which is unprecedented for financial institutions.</p><p>This is only possible because verifying Bitcoin transactions is very accessible. While writing new transactions on the ledger is extremely costly, reading them to verify the integrity of the ledger is easy and accessible to all.</p><p>Full-validating nodes can be operated on computers less powerful than what anyone has at home or at work, making it trivial and affordable to verify the history of the Bitcoin transactions. Anybody can run them. This makes Bitcoin an impenetrable fortress of security as everyone can check every single transaction that ever happened in Bitcoin. It’s an openly auditable ledger.</p><p>Miners and full-node operators voluntarily run a version of the Bitcoin software that is compatible with the majority of the network. This maintains a general consensus on the shared rules of the network such as the block size, which dictates how many transactions can be included in a block by miners.</p><p>Large miners are incentivized to grow the size of blocks to include more transactions, gaining additional fees and making it more costly for newcomers and small participants. Full node operators choose voluntarily to run a version of the software to keep block size small to make verification accessible to everyone.</p><p>Miners have to be compatible with full-nodes to have the mined blocks be verified and approved. If Bitcoin’s block size grows, more powerful computers are required to run full-nodes with extra memory and bandwidth, which will centralize verification, adding a level of trust in the system, especially around miners.</p><p>Bitcoin’s current block size is 1MB, and has been challenged many times in the past. The most serious attack was in 2017 under the form of a fork, called Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which copied Bitcoin’s software and transaction history, and adjusted the code to raise the block size to 4MB.</p><p>Deviations such a Bitcoin Cash are the unavoidable by-product of the open-source nature of Bitcoin, which lets anyone create forked projects of Bitcoin’s Timechain, though the market continues to value these forked tokens at a substantially discounted value.</p>The Internet-Native Monetary System<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has recently seen the deployment of Lightning Network (LN), which is a layer built on top of Bitcoin to enable fast, cheap and anonymous payments. BTC is the base layer, or Layer 1. LN is the second layer, also referred to as L2. BTC and LN interoperate in a cryptographically secure manner.</p><p>LN is a network of nodes for routing payments that lets people send sats (subunits of bitcoins) where 1 BTC = 100,000,000 sats. It is much cheaper to use LN for smaller amounts instead of using BTC’s on-chain network because transactions aren’t replicated by a global system of miners and nodes to be preserved for eternity in the Timechain.</p><p>On the Lightning Network, transactions occur directly between peers, and only occasionally settle on-chain if needed as an arbitration system.</p><p>Under beta release, the Lightning Network was deployed in 2018 and has since seen a massive growth in its utilization with over 8,000 public nodes connected to the network, around 40,000 channels connecting them and more than $5 million of liquidity. One day, as LN matures, it may very well power the world’s commerce, exchanging trillions of dollars of value in today’s terms.</p>♦Source: 1ML<p>Intrinsic BTC/LN properties let people store, exchange, and measure value on the Internet. These three functions are the primary use cases for standard money we use today for our everyday lives. It just exists natively on the Internet, available to anyone with a connection.</p><p>Bitcoin and Lightning Network are two public protocols that are undeniably morphing into native Internet money, but it is still incredibly early.</p><p>Infrastructure is in its infancy, following a steady increase in global adoption with now a few millions of people using Bitcoin. Many improvements on both the base and second layer are made around privacy, security, and performance.</p>Beyond Bitcoin and Lightning Network<p>As the Internet liberated free information between global peers, Bitcoin is liberating capital exchange, creating open, fair, and social markets in which anyone can participate.</p><p>New companies exclusively built on Bitcoin’s base layer and/or Lightning Network are making it safer and easier for sovereign people to opt-out of the legacy banking system.</p><p>As trust-minimized agents, companies building the “Layer 3” of Bitcoin and Lightning Network are pushing for reasonable adoption with ethical principles and a core focus on security, usability and sovereignty.</p><p>Whether working on non-custodial private key management, LN channel capacity distribution, protocol implementations, or peer-to-peer BTC exchanges, L3 companies make the capital flow from the legacy banking system into Bitcoin possible.</p><p>L3 companies are creating massive economic upside potential for this new Internet monetary layer and will be building a Bitcoin-based economic system in the next 20–30 years without a doubt.</p><p>As always, major thanks to a few Bitcoiners who helped out with reviews, edits and suggestions.</p><p>Originally published at thibm.net.</p>♦

  ♦<p>We’re always looking for ways to make Stellar better: more scalable, more efficient, more flexible. Usually that means we work directly on the protocol. But sometimes we take a more “blank slate” approach and imagine entirely different ways for a blockchain to function. Sidechain research like this helps us develop features and learn things that we can apply back to Stellar.</p><p>We’re excited to announce the latest example of such research, which we’re calling ZkVM, the zero-knowledge virtual machine. ZkVM is an experimental multi-asset blockchain architecture for scalable and confidential smart contracts.</p><ul><li>ZkVM technical white paper</li><li>ZkVM instruction set and specification</li><li>Implementation of ZkVM in Rust</li></ul><p>ZkVM transactions contain programmable constraints over encrypted data and assets. Individuals and organizations can safely perform their transactions and custom financial agreements directly on the shared ledger, instead of keeping them in siloed databases.</p><p>The ZkVM blockchain uses a compact data model that fits in a few kilobytes. Verification of transactions is highly parallelizable and takes 1–2 ms per CPU core. Nodes can bootstrap instantly from a network-verified snapshot. Virtually any computing device can run a full node, without relying on intermediate infrastructure and trusted third parties.</p>Stellar and ZkVM<p>All existing blockchains have inherent limitations:</p><ul><li>transactions are slow to relay, verify and confirm;</li><li>blockchains are hard to scale because every node needs to keep track of the entire system;</li><li>the requirement to publish all transactions is often incompatible with confidentiality needs of the markets and businesses;</li><li>higher-level protocols and applications are hard to build due to either lack of flexibility or inefficiency of the underlying blockchain protocol.</li></ul><p>Stellar, with its federated consensus mechanism, does very well in terms of speed and scalability. Our research on ZkVM aims at helping Stellar afford users more privacy and flexibility.</p><p>ZkVM is designed from the ground up to be a multi-asset ledger that can be used with the Stellar Consensus Protocol. It can process large volumes of transactions, allow wider use of the full validators, protect confidential data, and support the creation of a custom protocol on top of the blockchain rules, without having to upgrade the network with additional features. Stellar would benefit from any of these features.</p><p>Here’s how ZkVM works.</p>Transactions and contracts<p>ZkVM grew out of our prior work on TxVM, which in turn was influenced by the design of Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p><p>ZkVM uses a novel transaction format pioneered in TxVM: a transaction is represented as a program that manipulates flow of assets directly as first-class objects and emits the necessary updates to the blockchain state in the form of a transaction log. The transaction log then can be applied to the state of the system separately from transaction validation, which permits a highly scalable design, while offering a powerful, yet safe environment for custom contracts.</p>♦<p>To help scale the blockchain state and permit confidential value transfer, ZkVM uses a utxo model to represent balances: all balances are represented by a set of “unspent transaction outputs” (abbreviated as utxos) that can be created and destroyed. Each transaction proves ownership of the asset values in the previously created outputs, destroying those outputs, then issues, splits and merges the values, and creates new unspent outputs.</p><p>Unspent outputs are compactly stored as merkle roots via the Utreexo scheme, which dramatically decreases the storage requirements and allows much wider deployment of fully-validating nodes.</p>♦<p>In ZkVM each output is a contract persisted in the blockchain state. Each contract contains an arbitrary number of items that could be values or data parameters, protected by a predicate — a condition that must be satisfied in order to unlock the items.</p><p>ZkVM uses a variant of Taproot design to allow unlocking the contracts with either an ordinary cryptographic signature, or by revealing and executing an embedded sub-program that verifies custom conditions.</p>♦<p>Contracts in ZkVM are versatile building blocks for the higher-level protocols such as accounts, order books and payment channels. This could allow a platform like Stellar to move design choices in such protocols out of the consensus-critical layer, enabling rapid experimentation with a wide range of decentralized applications.</p>Confidentiality<p>Use of the Taproot scheme in predicates offers a good trade-off between confidentiality and customization: contract logic does not need to be revealed if all parties to a contract cooperate, but still provides security in case they do not. When the contract logic has to be revealed, the data (such as balances, prices and other contract parameters) still remain secret due to use of a constraint system verified in zero-knowledge.</p><p>ZkVM is built on top of the state-of-the-art implementation of the Bulletproofs zero-knowledge proving system. Values and data are encrypted by default and represented as Pedersen commitments. ZkVM allows users to specify arithmetic and logical expressions over secret values that get automatically turned into a Bulletproofs constraint system.</p><p>The most simple transactions contain a single cloak instruction that emits constraints proving the correct distribution of M input values into N output values. Custom contract conditions may impose additional constraints on the values, such as verifying the required interest payment on a loan completely in zero-knowledge. ZkVM supports a complete set of arithmetic and boolean instructions that allow expressing arbitrary conditions commonly found in financial contracts.</p>♦<p>Bulletproofs framework does not require trusted setup and allows each transaction to efficiently construct a unique constraint system on the fly, enabling transaction authors to create new protocols on top of ZkVM without the need to upgrade the entire network for each new feature.</p><p>The resulting transactions are compact and can be verified very efficiently. Small transactions are around 1–1.5 Kb in size, while aggregated payments have marginal cost of just 200 bytes per input-output pair. Verification is highly parallelizable and takes about 1 ms per output. As a result, ZkVM does not require users to trade off security for efficiency: all data can be encrypted by default and revealed only to authorized parties on the need-to-know basis.</p><p>Stellar will benefit greatly from the experiment in confidential smart contracts, as it opens doors to a wider range of new applications.</p>Learn more and participate<p>You can find more details about ZkVM in our whitepaper (also available as a PDF for those seeking a glossy magazine experience).</p><p>We develop the VM and all its sub-protocols under the umbrella of the open source Project Slingshot. It began with the protocol team at Interstellar and now is lead by the Stellar Development Foundation. We invite everyone to participate: please ask questions, file issues and make pull requests in our repository.</p>♦<p>ZkVM: a new design for fast, confidential smart contracts was originally published in Stellar Developers on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Hi Ilya,</p><p>I’m Laurent, the developer of OXT.</p><p>This is a great analysis and you’re certainly right when you say that Samourai should provide more materials explaining the different tools (principles, goals, …). I’m certainly guilty here. For a long time, I’ve been wanting to write a series of posts trying to explain the different tools provided by the wallet but it’s still a work to be done. So, thanks for this post!</p><p>You’re absolutely correct that Ricochet has a footprint which could be used to tag these transactions as sent by Samourai. Actually, these 2 points are part of the threat model used for Samourai Wallet (another thing that I would like to write formally). Indeed, we consider that:<br>- the adversary knows that the user uses Samourai Wallet (something which is certainly true for most wallets),<br>- Ricochet isn’t a “privacy tool” but an “escape tool”.</p><p>Allow me to provide some more details (until I have better posts).</p><p>In a nutshell, Samourai Wallet is designed as a toolbox providing tools with very different objectives, tradeoffs/limitations and use cases:</p><p>The “basic privacy” tools<br>E.g.: support of HD wallets, BIP47/Paynyms<br>The goal of these tools is to minimize address reuse. It isn’t a very ambitious goal bit it’s the first step on the path of an improved privacy.</p><p>The “privacy backed by maths” tools<br>E.g.: Whirpool (mixing à la Zerolink)<br>The goal here is to improve the privacy of users with schemes relying on mathematics (combinatorics). Whirpool transactions have a clear fingerprint but that’s part of the threat model (Whirlpool doesn’t try to hide that mixing is happening).<br>Tools like Whirpool/Wasabi/JoinMarket/etc are far from perfect but they’re certainly one the best options until we have better solutions included at protocol level.<br> <br>The “deception” tools<br>E.g.: Stonewall (transaction mimicking a 2 parties coinjoin), Stonewall-2P (a transaction similar to a Stonewall but with 2 participants), Stowaway (transaction à la P2EP/PayJoin).<br>The philosophy used to design these tools is very different from tools like Whirpool. “Deception” tools aim to introduce some degree of uncertainty and false positives in the analysis made by adversary. They don’t (and they’ll never) try to provide as much privacy as tools like Whirpool but they’re useful for everyday transactions or for users who can’t afford the cost of mixing. And they‘re likely to be enough as a protection against the less sophisticated adversaries. I’m especially optimistic about Stowaway but only time will tell.</p><p>The “escape” tools<br>E.g.: Ricochet<br>The most important point here is that “escape” tools aren’t privacy tools.<br>The idea behind Ricochet was first proposed by Adam Back or Peter Todd (someone will correct me). The principle is very simple: since exchanges are required to check the origin of deposits up to a certain depth, let’s introduce a few hops between the wallet and the exchange. The first iteration of Ricochet was literally that, a series of transactions with 1 input and 1 output. (a very distinctive fingerprint as you can see). Since then, a second version with a different fingerprint is borned. It’s likely that it will happen again in the future. As far as I know, despite its simplicity, Ricochet has provided excellent results so far.</p><p>The goal of “escape” tools isn’t to improve the privacy of the user but to avoid accounts arbitrarily closed by exchanges because an utxo has unfortunately crossed the road of a “tainted” utxo (whatever that means).<br>The philosophy used to design “escape” tools is very specific. Here, the motto is “cat-and-mouse game”. “Escape” tools have fingerprints and it’s a part of the game. As time passes, the fingerprints are going to evolve.</p><p>In the great scheme of things, one day all these tools will be made obsolete by a better solution at protocol level. Until it happens, I guess that the Samourai’s team will continue to do its things and I’ll be glad to help them in their effort.<br>And no need to say that all useful contributions like your post are very welcome!</p><p>laurent</p>♦

  ♦
<p>Dydx is the Ethereum-based on chain crypto derivatives platform that’s been in development for some time now. As they just launched to the public today, I thought I would do a quick review. Quick caveat&#8211;I’m approaching this as a first-time user and didn’t do any research into what their upcoming plans are. Also, I haven’t followed their development roadmap.<br></p>



<p>1) What is the value prop/who might use this? </p>



<p>From what I can see, the value prop would be for those who want to trade ETH on leverage but don&#8217;t want to have to trust their margin collateral with a centralized exchange such as Bitmex, Deribit, etc. The main user should be someone who closes their CDP at 16.5% rate, wipes their DAI, and reopens a leveraged long on dydx. As for more active crypto traders using ETH collateral, they’re probably better off taking the exchange risk on Deribit in return for a much better trading experience.</p>



<p></p>



<p>2) What is missing to realize that vision?</p>



<p>Liquidity, UX, leverage.<br></p>



<p>Assuming they can build liquidity and also a proper funding market that doesn’t have a bid/ask so wide you can drive a truck through it, I might use this. Low leverage is fine w/ me, and the fact that it works seamlessly with Metamask is nice. For now, I don’t see any reason to open a trade here. Has sort of a product-market fit problem in the sense that I tend to think small traders prefer much higher leverage than this and much better trading tools, while large traders require much larger liquidity.<br></p>



<p>3) How can a new exchange build liquidity?</p>



<p>Incentivize MMs, affiliate programs, memes. This is hard work and exchanges, even decentralized ones, require network effects and product differentiation. You are not just competing on cost but also on natural liquidity which is incredibly hard to attract.<br></p>



<p>Onward to some screenshots of my initial experience:<br></p>



<p>1 &#8211; Metamask shows a nice green &#8220;Connected&#8221; text which feels nice.<br></p>



♦



<p>2 &#8211; As a trader, the first thing I notice is the liquidity is absolutely abysmal. Bid is 162.25 and ask is 163.40 which is 0.70% wide. This is 10x wider than Deribit, Bitmex, and others. Any reason MMs cannot quote tighter here? Is it fee-related, latency, or both? Moreover, the depth of book is seriously lacking. A 100k USD order would be impossible to fill.<br></p>



♦



<p>3 &#8211; How are these borrow / depo rates getting generated and why are they so wide? On Bitfinex there is a populated central limit order book for funding, and on Bitmex these rates are simply implied by the premium in a p2p manner. Are these non-P2P rates?<br></p>



♦



<p>4 &#8211; What is utilization? Who is paying the borrow/depo rates when the supplied amounts are not being used? Who is setting these rates? I see no place to enter bids / asks for funding.<br></p>



<p>5 &#8211; This max leverage is low which I guess is prudent given the low liquidity. For comparison, centralized exchanges are 50x &#8211; 100x on the equivalent product.</p>



♦



<p>6 &#8211; Chart is complete amateur mode. They have 1D, 1W, and 1M on a low-res line chart. Probably should just white-label Tradingview to be honest.<br></p>



<p>7 &#8211; Where is the time &amp; sales blotter (ledger of all trades that occurred)?</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>

  <p>Bitcoin is different things to different people. Whatever it might be to
you, it is undoubtedly an opinionated and polarizing phenomenon. There
are certain ideas embedded in the essence of Bitcoin, and you might be
intrigued by some or all of them.</p>

<p>The invention of Bitcoin, and its underlying blockchain, which is so
widely misunderstood, spawned many projects, networks, and communities.
Some of these networks are in direct competition, which has resulted in
endless conflicts and lots of debate. The root of these conflicts is
ideological in nature: disagreement about how the world is and how it
should be — a disagreement about ideas.</p>

<p>The following is an attempt to explain some of the reasons behind this
polarization, explore the underlying dynamics in more detail, and
illustrate why an increasing number of people seem to be gravitating
towards Bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are some oddities in the perspective with which we see the
world. The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on
the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90
million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some
indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be, but we have done
various things over intellectual history to slowly correct some of our
misapprehensions.” 
<cite>Douglas Adams</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Agreeing on a Set of Ideas

<p>The goal of the Bitcoin network is to reach consensus, a general
agreement on the state of the system. Bitcoin’s breakthrough innovation
was utilizing unforgeable costliness to reach global consensus without
relying on a central authority.</p>

<p>Bitcoin can be understood as a game that anyone can join. Like all
games, it can only be played if it has rules, certain ideas which are
internally consistent. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a game; it would be
chaos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Before any game can be played, the rules have to be established;
before the game can be altered, the rules have to be made manifest.
[…] All those who know the rules, and accept them, can play the
game — without fighting over the rules of the game. This makes for
peace, stability, and potential prosperity — a good game. The good,
however, is the enemy of the better; a more compelling game might
always exist.” 
<cite>Maps of Meaning</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin’s consensus rules are just that: a set of ideas, codified into
validation rules, acted out by nodes on the network. Changing this core
set of ideas is akin to changing what Bitcoin is, and the decentralized
nature of the network makes changing them extremely difficult. There is
no central authority to dictate changes, making unanimous adoption of a
new set of ideas virtually impossible. Anyone who changes the rules,
even if he thinks such a change is for the better, will start to play a
different game, with only those who join him.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin’s creator famously said: the nature of Bitcoin is such
that once the first version was released, the core design was set in
stone for the rest of its lifetime.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Satoshi had certain ideas in mind when he created Bitcoin.
Many of these ideas are articulated in his writing, and even in the
genesis block. Most importantly, however, his core ideas are codified
in Bitcoin’s consensus rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fixed supply</li>
  <li>no central point of failure</li>
  <li>no possibility of confiscation or censorship</li>
  <li>everything can be validated by everyone at all times</li>
</ul>

<p>This set of ideas is embedded in the rules of the network, and you have
to adopt them to participate. In essence, a network like Bitcoin encodes
a social contract in its software: ideas which are shared by everyone
on the network.</p>

Spreading ideas

<p>All great things start small, and Bitcoin was no exception. In the
beginning, it was one node, one piece of software, one person, one set
of ideas. On 31 October 2008, the Bitcoin whitepaper was published. Two
months later, on 3 January 2009, the genesis block was mined. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout
for banks.” 
<cite>Bitcoin’s Genesis Block</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took only two days until a second person was intrigued enough to join
the network. Hal Finney ran the software, connected to Satoshi’s node,
and the Bitcoin network was born. Soon, other people picked up on the
idea, ran the software, and set up their nodes to join the network. The
rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin network is a complex piece of machinery. The constituents of
the network — part technology, part biology — make it inherently
difficult to describe and understand. While the following doesn’t claim
to be a complete description of the system by any means, I think it’s
helpful to focus on some constituents in more detail. In particular, I
want to focus on the following four: ideas, people, code,
and nodes.</p>



  ♦


  Bitcoin's ingredients: two parts software, two parts hardware.



<p>On the physical layer, the network is made up of interconnecting
nodes. Bitcoin’s consensus rules are embodied in its software, i.e.
the code which is running on its nodes. Ultimately, people are
choosing which software to run, a decision which is shaped by the set of
ideas they hold.</p>

<p>The possibility of running self-sovereign nodes is part of the reason
why Bitcoin’s consensus rules are so hard to change. As mentioned above,
there is no central authority, no entity to trust. Changes have to be
adopted voluntarily by everyone. People are free to run any version of
the software, be it out of conviction, laziness, or contempt.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a system “based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,” to
quote the whitepaper. The implication is that you are the authority
and you have to verify everything for yourself from scratch. Out of
this, consensus emerges.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Freedom brings men rudely and directly face to face with their own
personal responsibility for their own free actions.” 
<cite>Frank Meyer, In Defense of Freedom</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As soon as consensus is reached on the network, value comes into play.
That bitcoins — or any monies, for that matter — have value, is in
itself an idea that people need to be convinced of. </p>

<p>For Bitcoin, this process took almost 500 days. When the network was in
its infancy, bitcoins weren’t worth anything. They were mined and sent
back and forth between curious cypherpunks. However, the moment Laszlo
exchanged 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, Bitcoin went from zero to one. In
an instant, the network became valuable in a tangible way.</p>

<p>Ever since this moment, the following idea-value feedback loop is at
play:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bitcoin’s set of ideas — its value proposition — is
 attracting people.</li>
  <li>Those people freely choose which code to run.</li>
  <li>The selected code runs on individual nodes, dictating their
 behavior.</li>
  <li>Nodes join the network, connecting to peers who share their
 ideas.</li>
  <li>The network reaches consensus, enabling agreement on who owns
 what.</li>
  <li>The value, in turn, is based on the set of ideas enforced by
 consensus rules: the embodiment of its value proposition.</li>
</ol>



  ♦


  Idea-value feedback loop.



<p>This idea-value feedback loop, the re-enforcement of ideas through value
creation, is the mechanism behind Bitcoin’s gravity. Everything in this
cycle influences everything else — whether it is software, hardware,
or wetware. This loop is what ultimately captures people, and since
Bitcoin’s core set of ideas is virtually fixed, it has some surprising
effects on the sets of ideas held by people.</p>

Bitcoin’s Gravity Well

<p>As we have seen above, Bitcoin is an opinionated piece of software,
creating an opinionated network. The result of an opinionated network is
that it attracts opinionated people. </p>

<p>Arguably, most early adopters of Bitcoin shared its core set of ideas.
As Dan Held points out in Planting Bitcoin, Satoshi carefully chose
the initial group of people: cryptographers and cypherpunks, who
understood the technical components Bitcoin is made of.</p>

<p>There are many paths which might bring you close to Bitcoin’s
gravitational pull: you might have an interest in cryptography,
information security, or financial technologies. You may hold certain
political or economic beliefs. You might be a gold bug, free speech
advocate, or a speculator. You may need to use Bitcoin out of necessity.
Whatever the reasons for your initial contact with Bitcoin, there is a
certain probability that you are pulled in. Satoshi alluded to this
multi-dimensional attractiveness in one of his emails to the
cryptography mailing list.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain
it properly. I’m better with code than with words though.” 
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to illustrate this is by visualizing a landscape of ideas. Since
the number of all possible ideas is basically infinite, we will have to
focus on a small subset. And since we are talking about Bitcoin, we will
focus on the small universe of ideas spawned by asking the question of
what Bitcoin is.</p>



  ♦


  What is Bitcoin?



<p>Ask three strangers what Bitcoin is, and you will probably get three
very different answers. Any answer is necessarily shaped by past
experience, political and economic beliefs, and an individual
understanding of the world. Your personal set of ideas, your world view,
defines where you are on the landscape of ideas.</p>

<p>The landscape has sets of ideas which clump together: narratives,
which help to explain what Bitcoin is. One person might think of Bitcoin
primarily as digital gold, focusing on the store of value aspect of
Bitcoin. Another person might think of Bitcoin as a payment system,
focusing on the medium of exchange aspect of Bitcoin. Yet another person
might think of Bitcoin as a way to automate more complex social
constructs, focusing on automation of contracts and similar ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Nobody can know everything. The complexity of society is irreducible.
We cling to mental models that satisfy our thirst for understanding a
given phenomenon, and stick to groups who identify with similar
narratives.”
<cite> Dan Held</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These narratives, these sets of ideas, describe both what Bitcoin
actually is — at least in part — and what people think it is.
These narratives will necessarily evolve over time as our understanding
of the system and the system itself evolves. Neither ideas, nor people,
nor Bitcoin, nor the world at large are static things. Our visions of
Bitcoin have changed, and will continue to do so in the future.</p>

<p>Whatever Bitcoin is, it acts as a gravity well in this universe of
ideas. If your set of ideas overlaps with those embodied by Bitcoin, you
are close to its gravity well and captured easily. If your set of ideas
is opposed to Bitcoin’s, you are far away from its gravitational pull
and remain unattracted.</p>



  ♦


  What is Bitcoin?



<p>Consequently, Bitcoin is attracting opinionated people who share certain
ideas and ideals. “Birds of a feather flock together,” as the saying
goes. In this case, many nerd-birds and cypherpunks flocked around
Bitcoin early. Not particularly surprising.</p>

<p>What is surprising, however, is the side-effect of an opinionated
network: it influences people. Since the set of ideas embodied by
Bitcoin is fixed, it is the set of ideas held by people which has to
align — not vice-versa. The last ten years have shown that Bitcoin is
very effective in changing minds. So far, no single mind was
particularly effective in changing it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So the universe is not quite as you thought it was. You’d better
rearrange your beliefs, then. Because you certainly can’t rearrange
the universe.”
 — Isaac Asimov</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To repeat an old TFTC trope: Bitcoin will change us more than we will
change it, as I have learned myself.</p>

Attraction and Repulsion

<p>But what if your set of ideas does not overlap with Bitcoin’s? What if
you wish to change Bitcoin’s set of ideas, not convinced of the futility
of this endeavor? What if you are downright repulsed by some of its
ideas?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The miracle of physics that I’m talking about here is something that
was actually known since the time of Einstein’s general relativity;
that gravity is not always attractive. Gravity can act
repulsively.”
<cite>Alan Guth</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are truly repulsed by Bitcoin’s ideas, you might end up drifting
away into space, joining the interstellar void where nocoiners float
around.</p>

<p>If you want to change Bitcoin’s ideas in a fundamental way, you might
end up creating another gravity well. This is easily possible because of
Bitcoin’s openness. Its open source code, permissionless network
structure, and lack of formal organization of any kind allows anyone to
copy, modify, and run the code without asking for permission.</p>

<p>As outlined above, changing the core rules of Bitcoin results in a new
game — different from the game everyone else is playing. To not play
alone, you would have to convince other people to play with you. If you
want to have the same number of people to play with, you will have to
convince everyone on the network that your set of ideas is better than
the one held by everyone else. And since this is mostly a financial
game, strong network effects are very beneficial; it is in your best
interest to convince everyone.</p>

<p>Failing to do so will create a competing system; either by creating a
new network or by splitting off from the existing Bitcoin network. Since
all new projects are inspired by Bitcoin, the set of ideas necessarily
overlaps; sometimes almost exactly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tracking narratives is a good way to help people understand that
there are, in fact, a menu of beliefs competing for their affiliation;
[…] Trying to identify where one narrative ends and another begins
is a challenging task, as ideas tend to have permeable borders.”
<cite>Nathaniel Whittemore</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since creating new gravity wells is (a) possible and (b) relatively easy
to do (copy Bitcoin’s code, change a few parameters, launch the new
network with a couple of friends) there was an explosion of alternative
coins in the last few years. While most of these altcoins are outright
scams, some try to find a niche, attracting people who share its new or
modified set of ideas.</p>



  ♦


  Different ideas are captured by different gravity wells.



<p>Being sucked into one of these gravity wells — and thus into an
idea-value feedback loop — is the reason for much of the toxicity we
see in Bitcoin and elsewhere. The direct link between holding beliefs
(ideas) and holding assets (value) is a multiplying factor which can
result in ever deeper entrenchment. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everyone knows nowadays that people “have complexes.” What is not so
well known, though far more important theoretically, is that complexes
can have us.” 
<cite>Carl Jung</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could argue, as Carl Jung did in relationship to complexes, that
blockchains have people. At the root of every gravity well is a set
of ideas and a group of people which are had by them.</p>

<p>Once captured, a difference in technicalities can easily become a
difference in ideologies — and vice versa. Giving up on ideas is
difficult in any case, but if your net worth is intractably linked these
ideas it becomes ever more difficult.</p>

Orbits and Collisions

<p>The formation of any gravity well isn’t exactly a smooth ride. Just like
stellar and planetary formation is violent at times — suns swallowing
planets, planets bumping into each other, and moons being smashed to
pieces — the formation of Bitcoin’s gravity well had some violent
events too. </p>

<p>I plan to explore some of these events in the future, but for now, let’s
just acknowledge that there are other projects orbiting Bitcoin and that
there have been collisions in the past.</p>



  ♦

<p>Whether all other projects will be swallowed by Bitcoin or die on their
own, or whether some will find stable orbits, is yet to be seen. What
can be observed today, however, is that most networks are competitive.
To quote Eric Hoffer: “the gain of one in adherents is the loss of all
the others.”</p>

<p>What can also be observed, since it has happened multiple times over the
last couple of years, is that projects which fail to deliver on their
value proposition are quickly losing most of their adherents and also
their value — the former due to disillusion, the latter due to market
forces. Value, and speculation on future value, is an integral part of
the idea-value feedback loop. If ideas don’t materialize or fail, real
(and speculative) value is lost, which is effectively killing those
ideas and the networks which embody them.</p>

<p>However, as long as people hold different sets of ideas, and as long as
a project in Bitcoin’s orbit embodies this set of ideas, people will
flock to it. Whether those ideas have merit will be decided by time, the
open market, and ultimately, reality. Horrible ideas don’t work at all,
bad ideas not for long, and solutions which aren’t substantially better
than the status quo won’t thrive in a free market.</p>

<p>The best ideas, however, might be discovered by the biggest networks and
will be assimilated, if assimilation is possible. If Bitcoin can eat it,
it will eat it.</p>

Feeding on Ideas

<p>As mentioned above, Bitcoin’s core set of ideas is fixed from day one.
However, this doesn’t imply that Bitcoin can’t be improved. It can and
should be improved, but it has to be improved in ways that don’t
destroy the essence of Bitcoin. Such improvements are happening all the
time, which is why we can send payments to script hashes, have
segregated witness, and can pay small amounts quickly and cheaply on
the lightning network.</p>

<p>The technicalities of improving Bitcoin — and the important difference
between a soft and a hard fork — are well worth exploring, but are
beyond the scope of this article. Without going into more details in
regards to the nature of these improvements, Bitcoin undoubtedly is
improving, and thus its feature set is changing and expanding.</p>

<p>In terms of gravitational pull, this means that Bitcoin is gaining mass.
The set of ideas which describes Bitcoin is expanding along with its
feature set, potentially capturing more people and swallowing competing
projects and ideas in the process.</p>

<p>The idea of cheap payments, for example, has re-emerged thanks to
payment channels on the lightning network. While still in its early
stages, other projects built on this idea will lose their merit if the
lightning network is successful on a large scale. </p>

<p>Privacy is another idea which is at the root of several competing
projects. If future privacy enhancements in Bitcoin prove to be
successful (Schnorr signatures, lightning, whirlpool, wallets
supporting CoinJoins), these projects might be swallowed by Bitcoin as
well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their
houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their
goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into
the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among
the congregation.” 
<cite>Book of Numbers</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not saying that all other projects will perish, necessarily. But
networks thrive because of network effects: the winner takes most, if
not all.</p>

The Value of Conviction

<p>Whenever people are debating ideas, tribalism is the norm, not the
exception. Whether it is politics, sports, iPhone vs Android, or
pineapple on pizza, people identify with the camp that is closest to
their ideas and ideals.</p>

<p>While the validity of ideas are sometimes hard to measure, either
because their consequences are very indirect (politics) or subjective
and not truly consequential in the grand scheme of things (pineapple on
pizza), networks like Bitcoin come with a direct measurement: value.</p>

<p>While this value can be distorted by both manipulation and speculation,
it is a reliable and (almost) direct indicator of both conviction and
validity of ideas. If more people are convinced by a network’s set of
ideas, more people will hold its native token as an asset. And the more
those ideas align with reality, the more real-world value is generated
by the network, convincing more people and deepening the convictions of
those already convinced.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has the largest gravity for a reason: it works since day one,
solves real problems for real people, generating real value. It works
because its set of ideas aligns most closely with reality. It is
valuable because people believe in its value proposition, and with good
reason: Bitcoin is the largest, most secure, most robust network for
permissionless and digital value transfer to date. And it is growing.</p>

<p>Whether you are already convinced by Bitcoin’s ideas or are
diametrically opposed to them, Bitcoin will continue to not care. Its
gravitational pull will continue to increase, swallowing ideas, people,
code, and nodes in the process.</p>

Conclusion

<p>We have seen that Bitcoin embodies a certain set of ideas in its
consensus rules and overall architecture. Changing Bitcoin’s core set of
ideas is virtually impossible, which is why its core design is “set in
stone” since day one.</p>

<p>The idea-value feedback loop is what creates Bitcoin’s gravity. People
coming close to this feedback loop have a certain probability of being
captured, which forces them to align their own set of ideas with
Bitcoin’s or “fork off.”</p>

<p>Understanding that any unchanging system will change its participants is
helpful in understanding both attraction to and repulsion by Bitcoin.
Since changing the core set of ideas is not an option, new projects
embodying new sets of ideas are launched, creating new gravity wells in
the process.</p>

<p>A different idea-value feedback loop is the basis for each gravity well.
Tribalism and loss-aversion help to explain some of the toxicity between
competing projects and communities, since falling into any feedback loop
will taint the world view of anyone captured by it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For one can fall victim to possession if one does not understand
betimes why one is possessed. One should ask oneself for once: Why has
this idea taken possession of me? What does that mean in regard
to myself?” 
<cite>Carl Jung</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both the world and Bitcoin are dynamic things, making any set of ideas
we currently hold insufficient for a permanent, complete view of either.
Bitcoin can and does change, even if its essence is virtually
unchangeable. No matter our individual beliefs, we must not get too
attached to any narrative, or to any set of ideas.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s dominance is no accident. Its set of ideas managed to convince
the largest group of people, generating the most value in turn. However,
exploring other ideas can be a good and healthy thing, if pursued
genuinely. Time and the free market will decide which ideas align with
reality. Bad ideas will vanish, and good ideas will be absorbed. </p>

<p>In a world where people hold a combination of ideas and valuable assets,
a feedback loop which links and reinforces both is a powerful force of
attraction. Whether you just started to feel Bitcoin’s gentle pull or
you’ve been a hodlonaut in close orbit, Bitcoin’s gravity will
continue to increase. I am convinced of that idea, and I hope to have
planted a seed of conviction in you as well.</p>

  ♦1. The Bitcoin Second Layer<p>Bitcoin’s antifragile protocol and its exponentially increasing network effects make it a behemoth, gradually swallowing up global economic activity. The latest of these network effects is a second layer protocol called Lightning Network, which uses bitcoin’s base layer protocol as its security. The concept of layered money is not new in monetary history. In this writing, I’ll be using gold as an analogy to describe why bitcoin will evolve in layers on its way to world reserve currency status.</p><p>Layered Money</p><p>Gold has served as money for millennia due to its unique chemical properties and its global network effects. But gold has not acted as money only in its raw physical form, or on its first layer. Gold is a perfect example of how a layered money system evolves. Let’s take a look at gold as money in a four layered example. I’ll describe the rule set, or protocol, of each gold layer so the reader can imagine similarities to bitcoin’s layered protocol approach.</p><p>The first layer of gold is the physical gold in its raw form after it is mined: gold nuggets. The protocol of gold’s base layer has only one rule. The element must adhere to the properties of the periodic table’s 79th element. If it does, it is gold; if it does not, it is not gold. Consensus around this “79th element” protocol is millennia old.</p><p>The second layer of gold is raw gold that has been melted and shaped into bars and coins following a standardized protocol of purity, weights, and measures. Mints can be controlled by governments or by private enterprise, but the coinage will only be considered money by users if the “79th element” first layer protocol is followed.</p><p>The third layer of gold is gold certificates. These are claims issued by banks that have taken gold on deposit. Third layer banks will only use gold coins and bars that follow the consensus second layer protocol of purity, weights, and measures and only from mints that are properly following the “79th element” protocol. These certificates can act as money but carry counterparty risk of the issuer.</p><p>The fourth layer of gold is certificates backed by bank-issued gold certificates. A liquidity provider can issue these certificates, which would require several layers of trust by the user. Somebody accepting fourth layer gold as money has to trust that the liquidity provider has real gold certificates, which are backed by physical gold at a bank that follows a standardized purity for gold deposits.</p><p>Each layer uses the layer beneath it for consensus and security. Money will always see a multiple layered expansion as it evolves, and each layer has costs and benefits. You can mine your own gold, but this process is very expensive with a high barrier to entry. You can buy gold coins and bars easily in most parts of the world, but using them for day to day commerce is unfeasible. As a merchant, you can accept gold coins but either have to trust the purity or assay the gold yourself. Once you’re using the paper certificate layers, you now are engaged in counterparty risk, but have easier capacity for transactions. Each layer serves a different function. Base layers are for final settlement, while higher layers are for facilitation of economic activity.</p><p>Bitcoin’s First Layer</p><p>Bitcoin’s first layer, or base layer, is a protocol proposed in 2008 that has reached a global state of consensus. Bitcoin’s unit of account, also called bitcoin, has exchange rates with currencies around the world in markets that are growing in depth and liquidity. The protocol itself has added vital updates in its young life that have strengthened both security and usability. The network’s uptime and its ability to prevent double spends are relentless.</p><p>Critics of bitcoin often incorrectly identify a feature of bitcoin, its slow speed, as a flaw. Bitcoin’s confirmation process is meant to be slow because of security reasons. The intent of bitcoin is censorship-resistant, scarce digital cash, not a speedy payments solution. The best way to think about bitcoin’s base layer protocol is as a final settlements layer. The final settlement of physical gold is also a slow, clunky, and expensive process. Imagine, for example, companies in different parts of the world settling large balances of gold by loading ships with physical gold bars and sailing fortunes hundreds of miles across seas. Not only is the delivery an arduous process, but the verification process is also quite a task. In theory, every single piece of metal would have to be tested for purity. This process should be considered as historical context for what is required to have true final settlement of scarce money. The energy consumption required to find valid blocks has dramatically increased over time which increases security, but difficulty adjustments ensure bitcoin still averages six blocks per hour.</p><p>Centralization and attack vulnerability, while both permanent concerns to owners of bitcoin, have not prevented huge sums of capital to be stored in bitcoin’s denomination. The denomination, commonly known as BTC, despite its commonly quoted exchange rates with fiat currencies, stands alone as a final settlement asset. With a secure and reliable final settlement layer firmly in place, development of higher layers can ensue: enter the Lightning Network.</p><p>Bitcoin’s Second Layer</p><p>Lightning Network is a second layer protocol on top of bitcoin. The protocol uses bitcoin as its native denomination, meaning that Lightning can only be used by those with real bitcoin. Under the hood, Lightning Network is a web of bidirectional payment channels, but the protocol’s functionality is beyond the scope of this writing. The important takeaway is that Lightning allows for the instantaneous transfer of bitcoin from peer to peer with one considerable difference from the first layer: channel balances can adjust but do not require immediate settlement on the base layer. Simply stated, Lightning transactions are unsettled bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Having unsettled bitcoin comes with risk, however. Bitcoin held in Lightning Network payment channels can be stolen by malicious actors if node operators are not properly monitoring the channels and the base layer. Malicious actors have a strong disincentive to steal, however, as fraudulent activity gives the victim ability to sweep all funds from the channel. Now that we have covered some of Lightning Network’s basics, let’s take a look at the importance and the significance of this new layer on top of bitcoin.</p><p>The Importance of Lightning</p><p>Firstly, the Lightning Network is a zero sum, fully reserved routing network.You may only use Lightning if you bring in real bitcoin, and all routing fees earned by liquidity providers are paid for by liquidity consumers. This allows Lightning Network to operate with one of the primary features of bitcoin, its limited supply.</p><p>Secondly, Lightning does not carry the burden of base layer confirmation. This allows for bitcoin to be exchanged ad infinitum without consuming precious block space. Lightning nodes can decide to take final settlement of their bitcoin by broadcasting the correct state of a payment channel to the base layer at any time, but they don’t have to.</p><p>Lastly, Lightning transactions can be interpreted as financial agreements, making Lightning Network a capital market layer. The network’s structure is built as a market for capital and liquidity. Bitcoin can now instantaneously fly around the world without having to wait an hour for final settlement. The two core components to any financial transaction, time value and risk premium, can be derived from Lightning transactions. Opportunity cost tradeoffs can be calculated, and bitcoin can be leased on a short term basis to the network without surrendering one’s private keys. With gold, there is no way to accrue positive interest on capital without surrendering the physical metal. This makes Lightning Network an absolute game changer for the entire concept of capital markets: income without explicit counterparty default risk.</p><p>Digital Gold</p><p>Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold, but I’ll propose a more specific analogy. Bitcoin’s base layer is like digital physical gold, while Lightning Network is like digital paper gold but without the counterparty risk. The second layer is unsettled and less secure, but infinitely more usable. Bitcoin is incredible at censorship resistance and decentralization, but frankly terrible at speed and efficiency. Critics of bitcoin completely miss the fact that speed and efficiency should take place on higher layers, NOT on the base layer. Lightning’s arrival will show the world bitcoin’s true capabilities. If gold could only be used as a physical metal, global economic activity would have been prohibitive on a gold standard. Thankfully, paper gold satisfied the liquidity and capital market layer. Lightning Network ensures bitcoin’s path to global reserve currency because it makes bitcoin come alive. Once bitcoin can be transacted around the world without the constraint of a slow confirmation process, it can graduate from reserve asset to reserve currency. Lightning Network finally frees bitcoin from its base layer shackles.</p>2. The Time Value of Bitcoin<p>The HTLCs in Lightning Network give bitcoin a path to become a global reserve currency. Lightning Network provides a framework to measure the time-value of bitcoin, a precursor for a capital market and reserve currency status. Observable variables in Hashed Time Locked Contracts can be used to calculate the interest rate received on bitcoin held in payment channels, allowing investors to measure their opportunity cost of capital. Lightning Network wallet software should include ways to calculate interest and prove the rate received in a trust-minimized way. A reference rate should be developed, using consensus to dictate how the rate is calculated. This reference rate can anchor off-chain bitcoin lending into the global economy, leading to bitcoin-denominated banks, credit ratings, debt capital markets, and eventually an entire financial system: a path toward status as a global reserve currency.</p><p>Calculation Method</p><p>Three observable variables are needed to calculate an interest rate: principal, cash flows, and time. In Lightning Network, the principal is the amount of bitcoin in a payment channel; cash flows are routing fees; time is the block-time in which the fee collection is measured. Wallet implementations should experiment with different interest rate calculation methods with the eventual goal of a consensus method. The US Dollar has Treasuries, Fed Funds, LIBOR, OIS, and SOFR all acting as reference rates within the capital market for lending, borrowing, and swapping cash flows. Bitcoin needs to establish a reference rate of its own, referred to in this writing as LNRR (Lightning Network Reference Rate).</p><p>There are many possible ways to calculate LNRR. Principal may be measured once per block or using an average over time. Fees may be measured for individual HTLCs, individual payment channels, or Lightning Network nodes with multiple channels. Block-time may be measured by the locktime of HLTCs or measured one block at a time. Compounding conventions may be discrete or continuous. On-chain fees paid to open and close channels may be included or excluded in the calculation. We need to experiment with calculation methods because bitcoin is an entirely new asset class and shouldn’t adhere to financial conventions of the past, even though traditional fixed income markets set the bar extremely high for financial sophistication.</p><p>Time-value of bitcoin</p><p>Fees, time-value, and security risk premiums are discussed in the The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments by Joseph Poon and Thaddeus Dryja:</p><p>The time-value of fees pays for consuming time (e.g. 3 days) and is conceptually equivalent to a gold lease rate without custodial risk; it is the time-value for using up the access to money for a very short duration.</p><p>Historically, one of the largest component of fees and interest in the financial system are from various forms of counterparty risk — in Bitcoin it is possible that the largest component in fees will be derived from security risk premiums.</p><p>Fees in Lightning Network can be attributed to two components, time-value and security risk premium. Fees compensate the leasing of bitcoin which translates into time-value. Positive interest rates should attract capital and competition. But Lightning Network node operators investing capital are not doing so purely risk-free. They are taking on a variety of risks, most notably the risk of using hot wallets to stake liquidity to the network. Therefore, interest rates will vary between nodes due to different security practices, captured here by the catch-all variable security risk premium.</p><p>r = time-value + security risk premium</p><p>Lightning Banks</p><p>Lightning Network will birth Lightning banks. Their first function will be to provide liquidity to Lightning Network by funding payment channels. They will try to position themselves as central routing hubs, capturing as many fees as possible. Competition will be open and fierce. Those with the greatest ability to efficiently manage payment channels and actively optimize routing positioning will profit.</p><p>Reference Rate</p><p>LIBOR was originally intended as an inter-dealer interest rate, however market conditions and manipulation scandals have significantly changed its role. Despite its evolution, LIBOR’s model could serve as an example for LNRR to follow. The calculation method for LIBOR is essentially a panel: banks are asked to submit rates and these rates are aggregated to form a reference rate published once a day. Lightning banks can publish their interest rates to each other in order to foster a dealer community similar to the LIBOR panel banks. Any node that can publish an interest rate can potentially contribute to LNRR.</p><p>Once Lightning banks establish LNRR, they can reference this rate and charge a spread for loans that are not secured by the Bitcoin blockchain. They can use the reference rate to attract deposits which would also not be secured by the blockchain. While off-chain, trusted, bitcoin denominated capital market activity does not benefit from Bitcoin’s immutability, it is essential for the establishment of bitcoin as a currency capable of global economic activity. Economic activity requires a tradeoff between time preferences which can only be achieved when savers are allowed to lend capital.</p><p>Reserve Asset to Reserve Currency</p><p>LNRR is not some magic solution. This paper is a suggestion to the Lightning developer community to start experimenting with the translation of HTLCs to a financial framework. We cannot go from Trace Mayer’s sixth network effect of financialization to the seventh network effect of reserve currency status without the correct financial tools. Bitcoin has already emerged as a new asset class and is now acting as a reserve asset for millions around the world. Transitioning from reserve asset to reserve currency will present a challenging path. Ideas like LNRR should be discussed and explored so that we can continue to push bitcoin forward as the world’s best abstraction of money.</p>3. The Bitcoin Risk Spectrum<p>Bitcoin is already a reserve asset. It is the world’s first true example of decentralized digital scarcity, and its elegant, predetermined supply schedule reinvents monetary policy. Its value is recognized by millions of people who own bitcoin as a savings vehicle, speculative investment, or currency hedge. Bitcoin is a reserve asset because millions of people own it as one. Its next step is to transition from a reserve asset to a functioning reserve currency by unlocking the bitcoin capital market. Lightning Network’s arrival finally allows us to assign time value to bitcoin, and we can begin building bitcoin’s capital market from first principles.</p><p>Lightning Network’s HTLCs</p><p>HTLCs are financial agreements with two important properties that eliminate reliance on trusted third parties. Firstly, the contracts have an embedded call option on the counterparty’s bitcoin which dissuades theft. Secondly, the contracts have an expiration, which prevents balances to be held in limbo to perpetuity. These two properties remove counterparty risk but instead introduce payment channel management risk. Routing Lightning payments is the equivalent of a short-term bitcoin lease and allows the router to earn fees; these fees can be used to calculate interest earned on bitcoin staked to Lightning payment channels.</p><p>Traditional Capital Markets</p><p>Traditional capital markets have a risk spectrum: generally speaking, higher variance of returns is positively correlated with a higher expected return. More risk, more reward. It is important to note that risk-free rates are entirely conceptual and theoretical. They are simply a matter of convention to facilitate financial theoretical research and improve communication. Therefore, this article is an attempt to discuss and derive bitcoin-native financial theory, including how bitcoin can be reconciled against other assets. Bitcoin is still trillions of dollars of market capitalization away from becoming a legitimate alternative to other deep capital markets like the ones denominated in US Dollars, Euros, Yen, Pounds, and Yuan. Before we dissect bitcoin’s risk spectrum, let’s take a look at that of the US Dollar to get a sense of which aspects bitcoin should copy and which it should reinvent.</p><p>US Dollar Risk Spectrum</p><p>Why is the US Dollar the world’s reserve currency? There are many reasons including geopolitical and economic prowess, but one of the reasons is the depth of its capital market. There are over $100 trillion in bond and equity securities, allowing owners of US Dollars to easily find a home for them. Its capital market can be viewed as a risk spectrum, with risk on the x-axis and expected return on the y-axis.</p>♦US Dollar Risk Spectrum<p>The first point (illustrated) on the risk spectrum is US Treasury debt. Financial theory requires a risk-free asset to establish baseline interest rates, and currently that asset is US Treasuries. The obvious flaw of this financial theory is that US Treasuries are not truly risk-free. They have default risk, albeit appropriately characterized by market as the lowest possible default risk that an investor can attain. (Many sovereign bonds now have yields lower than yields in the United States, but those bonds are not denominated in US Dollars. This article is written only comparing bitcoin to the US Dollar).</p><p>The second point is corporate bonds. Companies issue fixed obligations at a spread to US Treasuries; for example, this year Walmart issued a 5yr bond at 5yr Treasuries plus 0.60% and General Motors issued a 5yr bond at 5yr Treasuries plus 1.37%. Each of these companies used the 5yr US Treasury as a reference rate. Investors consider the risk premium, or creditworthiness, of each company relative to Treasuries. We can see from this example that bond investors view Walmart as more creditworthy than General Motors because Walmart borrows at a lower spread to Treasuries. This is why reference rates are considered an anchor for debt capital markets, because they more easily allow for relative value comparisons.</p><p>Further along the risk spectrum are investments with higher risk profiles, such as publicly traded equities and venture capital funds. Theoretical formulas for the expected return on equities usually include a combination of the risk-free rate and the company’s risk premium. Venture capital investors will seek an even higher return because the probability of principal loss is perceived to be higher than that of public equities. Theoretical risk premiums are added to each subsequent point of the risk spectrum, all anchored from the risk-free rate.</p><p>Bitcoin Risk Spectrum</p><p>Bitcoin’s capital market should be designed from first principles because its final settlement does not require trusted third parties. Final settlement of the US Dollar has counterparty risk because deposits are considered a liability on banks’ balance sheets. Holders of US Dollars would rather face the US government as a counterparty rather than banks, so they prefer to purchase US Treasuries with their deposits. Either way, the final settlement has counterparty risk. Additionally, the US Dollar itself depends on a single nation and has a single entity controlling monetary policy in a discretionary way; bitcoin avoids both of these risks. Let’s take a look at Bitcoin’s risk spectrum.</p>♦Bitcoin Risk Spectrum<p>The first point (illustrated) on Bitcoin’s risk spectrum is bitcoin held in cold storage. The analogy commonly used for cold storage is a gold bar held in your hand. There is no counterparty risk; the risk is its storage and security, much like if you had possession of physical gold. Skilled storage and security practices make loss less likely, and the advent of robust multisignature solutions further reduces risk. Private key management anchors the bitcoin capital market much like the timeliness and consistency of the US government paying back its debt obligations anchor the US Dollar’s capital market. The expected return on cold storage bitcoin is at best zero and is actually negative if you consider that storage costs and on-chain transaction costs are non-zero.</p><p>I am proposing that the second point on Bitcoin’s risk spectrum should be LNRR, the Lightning Network Reference Rate. Routing fees earned on bitcoin staked to Lightning payment channels can be expressed as an interest rate. The rates received on the payment channel or node level can be hashed and cryptographically provable. Node operators can opt-in to publish realized interest rates on their capital. If a consensus can be reached on an interest rate calculation protocol, capital providers can publish interest rates in an open and transparent way. Positive interest rates will attract bank-like entities that believe they can earn positive return using effective payment channel management and security techniques. Some bitcoin previously held in cold storage will seek the income attainable in Lightning Network, the first ever example of an opportunity cost tradeoff in bitcoin that doesn’t require additional counterparty risk. Bitcoin staked to Lightning is the most unique income producing asset in all of monetary history: income with zero counterparty risk. The historical implications of this on capital markets are tremendous.</p><p>A huge leap in risk exists between the second and third point on Bitcoin’s risk spectrum. The first two points, as we have established, have various security and management risks but no counterparty risk whatsoever. Real world lending of bitcoin has genuine counterparty risk, whether using exchange-based lending platforms or other forms of direct lending. In theory, these rates of borrowing should be higher than LNRR, and capital providers could use LNRR to make relative value decisions between bitcoin leasing via Lighting and off-chain bitcoin lending. Any real world lending will not have bitcoin’s blockchain as security. Lenders will need strong contracts in jurisdictions with strong rule of law to ensure repayment of capital, just as they do with fiat currencies. Complete loss of principal remains.</p>4. The Lightning Network Reference Rate<p>I present a three part proposal for Lightning Network node operators. The first and most crucial part of the proposal is a node-level calculation standard for the accrual of satoshis. The Node Accrual Rate (NAR) is offered as a formula to calculate the profitability of an individual Lightning node, expressed as an annualized interest rate.</p><p>The second part of the proposal is to convince Lightning node operators to disclose their NARs to each other. Transparency and financial disclosure are core tenants of capital markets, and the disclosure of NARs could correspondingly push bitcoin forward on its path to becoming a more robust asset class.</p><p>The third and final part of the proposal is to advocate a framework in which NARs across the network can be aggregated, averaged, and reported as one rate called the Lightning Network Reference Rate (LNRR). LNRR can pave the way for a world of relative value calculations and be instrumental in the pricing of off-chain bitcoin lending.</p><p>This is not a proposal for any changes to Lightning Network itself, nor a call for all nodes to share fee accrual data. Nodes will elect for themselves whether or not to share data, and most will likely choose not to do so. The formula is merely a suggestion for developers trying to capture the economics of payment routing.</p><p>The Time Value Layer</p><p>The Lightning Network sets up a framework from which we can calculate the time value of bitcoin. Interest rate calculations must have three known inputs: principal, income, and time. In Lightning terms, a node opens channels with other nodes and broadcasts the channel opening, essentially locking up principal for a predetermined amount of time. Assuming incoming channels are also opened to the node, the node is now positioned to route payments and charge fees for doing so. These routing fees can be considered income. The ending calculation can be expressed in many ways, but through time node participants will elect standards around which to coalesce. This proposal is a starting place for the discussion around these standards. If multiple standards emerge, I would view this as a positive development because competing calculation standards would foster deeper study of Lightning Network routing economics.</p><p>Lightning Network is also an optionality layer. Optionality is relevant to Lightning because it serves to offset one of the primary risks undertaken by Lightning node operators: malicious counterparty risk. Nodes carry the risk of their channel counterparts broadcasting a previous channel state, but this risk is theoretically negated by embedded call options which become executable upon malicious activity. The settlement optionality simultaneously serves as a security enforcement mechanism and a velocity accelerant.</p><p>Proposal #1: Node Accrual Rate</p><p>I propose the idea of a Node Accrual Rate (NAR) for individual Lightning nodes that desire a standardized method for calculating their realized interest rates. Nodes should be able to automatically calculate their rate of return on capital allocated to facilitate Lightning Network payment routing. Rates can be calculated by querying observable data available in their lnd, c-lightning, or Eclair clients. The following is a proposal for one way to calculate the rate using a generic formula for compounding interest and adapting for block time. The node data can be sliced and diced dozens of logical ways, and I look forward to many counterproposals that are sure to include innovative ways to capture return data.</p><p>NAR = [(p+f)/p]^(52,560/n)-1</p><p>Let n = the measurement period, expressed in number of blocks, suggested minimum value of 100</p><p>Let p = node’s average balance held in channels over the measurement period, expressed in satoshis</p><p>Let f = total routing fees earned by the node over the measurement period, expressed in satoshis</p><p>52,560 is the approximate number of blocks per year to normalize NAR as an annualized rate</p><p>n:</p><p>The suggested 100 block minimum measurement period is arbitrary but matches the minimum block time before mining rewards become spendable. Said another way, your Lightning node should be active a certain number of blocks in order to reasonably measure an annualized rate of return. I believe this minimum can be increased to cover at least one full difficulty adjustment period of 2,016 blocks once routing activity becomes more commonplace. A longer minimum measurement period would make for higher quality and less noisy data.</p><p>p:</p><p>The average balance of a node throughout time can be measured a multitude of ways. Striking channel balances upon each new block confirmation and then averaging these amounts over the measurement period could be a clean and impartial way to determine p.</p><p>f:</p><p>Lightning Network node operators are already sharing f with each other. I’ve seen numerous “day_fee_sum” screenshots on Twitter with positive integers next to them. Accelerated adoption of the Lightning Network over the past few months brought time value to bitcoin in a trustless way, and nodes are earning sats as a result. Node operators already sharing f with each other will soon be calculating and sharing their NARs as well.</p><p>Proposal #2: Disclosure of NARs</p><p>Lightning node operators currently volunteer information about collecting routing fees, managing payment channels, and other emergent routing techniques. In a similar way, I anticipate and strongly encourage nodes to volunteer their NARs. Sharing NAR data is an easy way to display profitability to other capital market participants. The exchange of profitability information is a foundational tenant of capital markets; the widespread exchange of NAR data between nodes would accordingly bring long term health to bitcoin’s capital market. Node operators are already disclosing the small amount of sats they’ve earned by routing payments through the Lightning Network, leading me to believe that such NAR exchanges will be commonplace for nodes motivated by profit or by transparency. Some nodes will look to attract capital in order to leverage their newfound skill set, even though most nodes will not be motivated to share data. Some nodes will be dishonest about their NAR, and the market will have to identify fraudulent disclosures just as forensic accountants dissect every disclosure from publicly traded corporations.</p><p>Advertising profitability, even if unaudited, will attract capital looking for return. Example: a Lightning node with sufficient capital and well positioned inbound and outbound payment channels earns a NAR (annualized return) of 0.25%. Funded with 10 million sats (0.1 bitcoin/~$400), the node earns about 957 sats (~$0.04) in one difficulty adjustment period (2,016 blocks/~2 weeks). The implications of being able to earn sats without relinquishing control of private keys is truly a monumental arrival for bitcoin in capital market terms, no matter how tiny the amount of interest may seem.</p><p>The node operator can choose to leverage its profitability by advertising a historical rate of return. The node from the example promises depositors a rate of return of 0.15% because a 0.25% return on routing would ensure a positive profit margin. The investor takes counterparty risk because the node could instantaneously exit scam with the depositor’s money or simply fail to deliver on its promise to pay a rate of 0.15% on invested capital. The node, however, is instead motivated by creating a strong reputation as a counterparty and repays all depositors the promised rate to establish creditworthiness and increase the potential for additional deposits. The routing income accrues to the node in a trustless way, but the depository relationships occur entirely off-chain in trusted counterparty situations. The bitcoin era Lightning Network bank, without barrier to entry, available to anybody with the appropriate hardware and software, has arrived. Many will route, profit, succeed, raise deposits, fail, mislead, overpromise, and default, all essential components to a healthy and functioning capital market.</p><p>Proposal #3: Lightning Network Reference Rate</p><p>Lightning Network transitions bitcoin to a more capital market oriented asset. Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLCs) combine some of the protocol’s most powerful features into a standardized financial agreement with defined optionality and expiry, allowing participants in the Lightning Network confidence to transact bitcoin without the burden of continuously auditing individual clauses. In theory, the HTLCs in Lightning Network provide bitcoin with its own native risk-free asset (aside from cold storage and HODLing, see Risk Spectrum section), which is a theoretical term in traditional finance used to describe the asset bearing the lowest possible risk within an investment universe. The US Treasury’s obligations carry this label in US Dollar capital markets, and like bitcoin held in Lightning payment channels, have materially less risk than other counterparties. Bitcoin held in Lightning payment channels should serve as a low-risk alternative to off-chain lending and can be used as a reference transaction by which to measure risk premium.</p><p>If Lightning node operators around the world disclosed enough NAR data to establish a statistically significant average, this average rate could serve the purpose of offering the bitcoin capital market an accurate measure of low-risk time value. Example: hundreds of nodes disclose NARs, and a cluster of rates is observed around 0.18%. The rate can be a cluster, average, or median of publicly disclosed NARs taken each block or daily, and the end result would be a reference rate widely disseminated to all Lightning Network participants. The Lightning Network Reference Rate (LNRR) can be a very powerful signal that bitcoin has a native time value, a rate that risky off-chain lending should theoretically exceed. If LNRR is equal to 0.18%, an exchange offering 6% on deposits is actually offering a rate of LNRR+5.82%. LNRR represents the time value of the transaction and 5.82% represents its risk premium.</p><p>Investors can lend money to the US Treasury at 2.5%, or they can lend to investment grade (IG) corporations at Treasuries plus 1% or junk grade (HY) corporations at Treasuries plus 4%. Investors don’t look at the IG and HY companies as investment opportunities yielding 3.5% and 6.5%; they strip away the Treasury component (time value of the US Dollar) to determine relative value between credit spreads. The Lightning Network Reference Rate can and should serve a similar function in bitcoin capital markets. Exchanges wouldn’t be offering deposit rates at 6% or 8.5% but instead at LNRR+5.82% or LNRR+8.32%.</p><p>The Goal is Reserve Currency Status</p><p>Reserve currencies need deep and liquid capital markets. Investments denominated in bitcoin exist only on a small scale, largely because bitcoin is still mostly a commodity and costs resources to store and use as opposed to other assets that accrue positive time value. Lightning Network officially switches the equation for bitcoin but is still a nascent technology. For bitcoin to continue its journey toward becoming a world reserve currency, theoretical financial frameworks such as time value, risk premium, and optionality have to evolve but without relying too heavily on legacy ideas and ideals. The primary reason for this proposal is to offer an opportunity for bitcoin to capture relevant characteristics from traditional capital markets and transform them into native and emergent bitcoin financial theory.</p><p>Please follow me on Twitter and feel free to reach out with any feedback.</p><p>twitter.com/timevalueofbtc</p>♦
