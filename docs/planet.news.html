  <p>The madness of this world became obvious in an instant. Everything is
changing way faster than most of us ever imagined — but I’m not
worried. To the contrary, I’m weirdly optimistic — because of Bitcoin,
and because of you.</p>

<p>You probably don’t know me; I probably don’t know you. And that’s
perfectly fine. However, I know some of you — and I believe that I
know some of you quite well, even if we have never met or met only
briefly. I have read your writings, watched you debate each other, saw
the things you’ve built, and listened to your voices for countless
hours. I don’t care if you identify as a bitcoiner, or as a maximalist,
or as a pre-/shit-/multi-/whatever-coiner. I don’t care if you fell down
the rabbit hole years ago or if you just got the first glimpse of the
honey badger den. I don’t care about your political beliefs, sexual
orientation, gender, religion, age, and countless other qualifiers that
might be used to put you in a box. The fact that you are here, reading
this, thinking about Bitcoin, caring about Bitcoin, is enough for me.
That’s why I’m bullish. Bullish on Bitcoin, and bullish on bitcoiners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bullish on bitcoiners.”</p>

  <p><cite>Matt Odell</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin’s implications are so far-reaching, the innovation so profound,
it boggles the mind. The inter-disciplinary nature of this beast
attracts minds from countless areas of expertise: computer science,
cryptography, mathematics, physics, economics, finance, trading,
engineering, the list goes on and on. Bright minds, extraordinary
characters, strong opinions, contrarians, idealists trying to change the
world — all those and more make up the loose collective we might call
bitcoiners.</p>

Honey Badger Don’t Care

<p>Don’t get me wrong: Bitcoin doesn’t need you; it doesn’t need any of us.
It’s incentive systems have a way to make sure that Bitcoin will be
fine, even if the set of people working on it and using it changes
completely. It will be fine, just as it is now as the whole world grinds
to a halt.</p>

<p>The current crisis — and the financial repercussions that will
inevitably follow — will make it obvious that we need Bitcoin more
than Bitcoin needs us. Again, don’t get me wrong: we must not be
complacent. We must continue to care, continue to build, continue to
educate, continue to proselytize, continue to argue, continue to debate.
We find ourselves at the forefront of a battle of ideas, and in this
battle, complacency kills.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ask not what bitcoin can do for you, but what you can do for
 bitcoin.”</p>

  <p><cite>Adam Back</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can contribute by coding, writing, educating, discussing,
recording, creating, or simply hodling — great. But make no mistake:
Bitcoin is bigger than all of us. And, dare I say it, the current
failure of the legacy system is bigger than Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Yes, Bitcoin has the potential to fix many of the underlying issues of
our corruptible and broken systems. But we will need a plethora of
freedom-enabling technologies to win this war; tools that empower the
individual by default, by offering strong privacy guarantees,
encryption, and the freedom to use these tools without restrictions.</p>

Shill Lightly

<p>As this global pandemic sweeps through the globe, with hundreds of
thousands infected, tens of thousands dead, and millions of people out
of a job, priorities shift from trivial to existential. While difficult,
it is more important than ever to stay humble and shill lightly. It is
all too easy to alienate friends and family by offering an enthusiastic
Bitcoin lecture every time you sit at the dinner table. While enthusiasm
is laudable, I strongly believe that Bitcoin will be understood by
everyone as soon as they are ready — be it out of necessity or out of
curiosity. Yes, the timeline just got accelerated. But this is still a
marathon, not a sprint. And it might be one of many marathons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the facts of history is that battles do not stay won. Those
 that matter have to be waged again and again.”</p>

  <p><cite>Stanley Knowles</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The powers that be will neither step away willingly nor silently. And
since the battle for self-sovereignty and freedom is one that matters,
it will have to be waged again and again.</p>

Protecting An Idea Whose Time Has Come

<p>Bad actors will continually try to undermine Bitcoin, as they have tried
in the past. Unfortunately, we have good reason to believe that this
will continue. And, unfortunately, we see the trend of undermining and
maiming technology everywhere we look. If we look at the internet, for
example, we see various interest groups waging war against net
neutrality, politicians introducing nation-wide firewalls, websites
geo-blocking content, people getting arbitrarily deplatformed,
demonetized, or banned.</p>

<p>They say that nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. I
believe that Bitcoin’s time has come, and in hindsight, it will be
obvious to everyone. Before it becomes obvious, however, swathes of
people will try to distort what Bitcoin is and the ideas it represents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ideas change the world, but they do it by assuming shape, they do it
 by taking concrete form.”</p>

  <p><cite>Stanley Knowles</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Bitcoin’s form is quite concrete since its inception, it is an
abstract, intangible form, making it exceptionally hard to grasp. It
will take some time until Bitcoin is as ubiquitous as the internet is
now. This time — this window of confusion — will be used and abused
by lawmakers and charlatans alike. However, it is also a window of
opportunity. An opportunity to sharpen our tools, to prepare for the
flood, to ship the future faster than they can ban it.</p>

They Are Always Wrong

<p>Undoubtedly, there are plenty of people who don’t want Bitcoin to
succeed. They will do everything in their power to prolong the
inevitable. They are wed to the current system, gaining from its
inherent imbalance. Some are close to the monetary spigot, or willfully
ignorant, or enemies of freedom in general. Others are outright evil,
aiming to become the foot that stomps on your face, forever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They told us not to wish in the first place, not to aspire, not to
try; to be quiet, to play nice, to shoot low and aspire not at all.
They are always wrong. Follow your dreams. Make your wishes. Create
 the future. And above all, believe in yourself.”</p>

  <p><cite>Joseph Michael Straczynski</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will continue to tell us that what we are doing is a pipe dream,
that what we are aiming for is impossible, that we can’t operate outside
of the current systems. They will restrict our freedoms: our freedom to
transact, our freedom to save, our freedom to remain private. They will
tell us that certain kinds of mathematics and software are illegal. They
will continue to justify mass surveillance by trying to sell us the
illusion of safety. And they will continue to be wrong.</p>

<p>Speak up. Be outraged. Use alternatives. Build alternatives. Don’t
settle for the status quo — we can do better. Bitcoin is what we make
of it, and I can’t imagine a better set of people to realize the full
potential of this grand idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is nothing better to be on a shared mission with extraordinary
people who can be radically truthful, and radically transparent with
 each other.”</p>

  <p><cite>Ray Dalio</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stay vigilant. Stay radical. Stay true to yourself. As the world is
grinding to a halt, and the fall of Rome becomes more likely than ever,
strong characters, sound principles, and truthful conduct are
imperative.</p>

<p>The stage is set, the drama is unfolding, and as the crescendo comes we
must not give in to tyranny. The path will be twisted and bumpy, and I’m
honored to walk it to the end, with you on my side. We got this.</p>

<p>This is the famous opening statement of Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty published by Carl Schmitt in 1922. This statement offers the fundamental axiom of how all sovereign power functions, and how the sovereign exception found in emergency legal decrees allows for any sovereign to overcome and dispose of the law. In the essay the political theology of crypto I explain how cryptography negates the possibility of the sovereign exception through the banishment physical and identifying power, which thereby erodes all forms of contemporary state and legal power. I have also wrote an essay on how the metaphysical tensions between any sovereign and any subject will always result in a power dynamic that where the sovereign decision will always over come any law in times of sincere crisis or emergency, and how cryptography negates this form of power. In this essay I would like to expound more deeply upon the explicit theology of bitcoin, its formula of power, and what it means for the fate of humanity in these darkest of times.</p>



Bitcoin as Subjectivity



<p>While bitcoin is inherently an object of war, it is also an object of art. Art because it is only an expression&#8211;an object of non-tangibility, and subjective individual human values according the society we live within. However, through a Hegelian synthesis of art and war; bitcoin spills out from the noosphere as a damnation of all fiat currencies of the world of flesh and steel, and the redemptive answer we seek to rescue and restore law, economy, and order from these crises forced upon them. Through the power of cryptography, and the systems of truth that it demands; Bitcoin expresses a form of truth that no human, institution, or organization is any longer capable of anywhere the physical realm or legal jurisdictions. </p>



<p>This artistic power of war that bitcoin harnesses comes from a totalizing deterritorialization and reterritorialization (in the Deleuzian sense of the word) of the global order through the initiation of a new plane of immanence based upon cryptographic power. This plane of immanence is the renewal of a nomos (law, customs, or social cohesion) of humanity with the internet at its organizational core, and truth as the form of legitimacy. It is a novus ordo seclorum where truth, not authority, becomes the renewed source of legitimacy for all people everywhere. Through the exchange of the legitimacy of power through the sacrifice of authoritarian decrees for the truth of what is, bitcoin inverts the sovereign formula of power. </p>



<p>Both Schmitt and Agamben, two of the leading scholars on the philosophy of sovereignty, define sovereignty as a boarderline concept that is traced throughout the theory of the state. Both conclude that sovereignty finds its foundation in the authentic decision that IS the sovereign exception of the law (also know as &#8216;a state of emergency&#8217; or &#8216;sovereign crisis&#8217;), not the norm. Schmitt surmises this as, &#8220;&#8216;All law is situational law.&#8217; The sovereign produces and guarantees the situation in its totality. He has the monopoly over this last decision.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is of great importance because it is through the sovereign exception found in emergency decrees all state law is doomed to the fascism inherent to it. There is no bearing or trace of truth in the sovereign exception; only the raw authoritative power that will justify any legal exceptions. The great father of the theory of the state himself, Thomas Hobbes surmised this in Leviathan rather flippantly as;</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Auctoritas, non veritas facit legem (authority, not truth makes legitimacy)&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Schmitt, whom is among the most esteemed of legal scholars on Hobbes and his theory of the state, further surmises this point of how authority functions within the sovereign exception:</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The exception, which is not codified in the existing legal order, can at best be described as a case of extreme peril, a danger to the existence of the state&#8230; It is truly a matter of extreme emergency and how the emergency can be eliminated&#8230; From the liberal constitutional point of view, there would be no judicial competence at all. The most guidance the constitution can provide is to indicate who can act in such a case&#8230; He [the sovereign] decides if there is an extreme emergency as well as what must be done to eliminate it. Although he stands outside of the normally legally valid system, he nevertheless belongs to it, for it is he who must decide weather the constitution needs to be suspended in its entirety&#8230; Whether one has confidence and hope it can be eliminated depends on philosophical, especially on philosophical-historical or metaphysical convictions.&#8221;</p><cite>Carl Schmitt, Political Theology p. 7</cite></blockquote>



Bitcoin as Philosophical Conviction



<p>Bitcoin is the philosophical cognition of a world that has lost its nomos, where truth no longer a fact, but an opinion of power. Only in a world where seditious guile rules opening, where money is but a tool for the politically powerful, does bitcoin present its radical antithesis to the current paradigm of law, order, and sovereignty. It is the fulfillment of a crypto-anarchist critique of state, money, and legal power. </p>



<p>It is this philosophical conviction&#8211;particular the philosophical-historical  cognition of what cryptography is, how it was developed for total war, and what its development throughout the concourse of human history means; that we find a categorical imperative from which the sovereign exception can be totally and completely eliminated. Through the linguistic form that is cryptography; a demand is created that can only be answered in binary form of &#8216;yes, yes,&#8217; or &#8216;no, no,&#8217; and nothing else. It is a formula of true / false statements of output ownership protected by the magnanimity of cryptography, which creates the timechain of bitcoin, and the fulfillment of bitcoin&#8217;s oath to the cryptography that concretes it. </p>



<p>The sovereign legal form glitches out before naked truth and the total silent obligation that is the secret of all state power, arcana imperii: </p>



<blockquote><p>“The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them. For the right men have by nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by no covenant be relinquished.”</p><cite>-Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan</cite></blockquote>



<p>A world that has lost its nomos is a world where no sovereign power, institution, or government can offer even the most basic protections or assurances that comprises of the dignity of life. While the law is suppose to be the fulfillment of the most basic promise of the social contract by the sovereign, we have entered into a territory where no such promise exist. The law today is little more than authoritarian approvals, appeals, rules, and decrees; lacking even the most basic contractual functions. Through the broken oaths of sovereign powers everywhere towards the most basic aspects of the social contract; all people everywhere have been forsaken, the truth of their laws and their justice corrupted in every way.  </p>



<p>In this darkest of nights however, there is a spectacular gem of truth from which light gleams and points towards our exit from this hollowed and damned place. Bitcoin and the cryptographic breakthroughs that it has ushered in over the last decade offers us a totally new and novel strategy of human organization that breaks out of the sovereign form and can restore law, order, and economy to their rightful places. As Foucault warned us, &#8220;In political and social theory, we still have not cut off the king&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bitcoin and cryptography is a form of power that is beyond any physical force and the brutishness of any form of authoritarianism for the very real truth it must contain in order to function, and the very real protection that the cryptography it contains offers. Bitcoin is the premonition of an idea whose time has come; of a humanity that is ready to rise to its task of the abrogation of the statism, and to restore the political to its rightful place at the forefront of any law. </p>



<p>Bitcoin is a new form of political, economic, and moral organization that raises truth to being the only sacrosanct of any law. It is the philosophical cognition of a world that understands the insipid greed of men, and the infinite vice that is power. Bitcoin has enables a new form of digital organization that banishes the prattling lies of men, and demands the proof of any claim. Bitcoin does this through returning truth to its preeminent place as the foundation of all social contracts, and the meaning of truth in such agreements through the cryptographic formula of verification. </p>



Bitcoin as Political Theology 



<p>At the very end of Political Theology, Schmitt of all people, provides us with an anarchist&#8217;s critique of any sovereign decision by the very virtue of what any decision by a sovereign power must be and how it is decided:</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every claim of decision must be evil for the anarchist, because the right emerges by itself if the immanence of life is not disturbed by such claims. This radical antithesis forces him of course to decide against the decision; and this results in the odd paradox where Bakuin, the greatest anarchist of the nineteenth century, had to become in theory the theologian of the antitheological, and in practice the dictator of an antidictatorship.&#8221; </p><cite>Carl Schmitt, the final paragraph of Political Theology</cite></blockquote>



<p>It is this radical antithesis that has us also decide against the decision as well. We are products of the late 20th century; grandchildren of the spectacle society where all forms of life that would not be subjected to the machine were liquidated long ago. Now under the grimace of the total corruption of law, the complete looting of the treasuries of all peoples by political and corporate oligarchies everywhere from &#8217;emergencies&#8217; of their own creation; we find the reason for us to rise against, and choose to reclaim that which is only ours. This the reactivation of the political as the struggle for life, and the right to die trying; opens the truly political (polis) once again. </p>



<p>We understand how Bitcoin makes for the oddest of paradoxes; with anarchism becoming in theory the greatest form of &#8216;capitalism&#8217; against all states, and in practice, a dictatorship of privacy and pseudonymity which unrelentingly will not give itself to anyone but the individual. </p>



<p>Bitcoin rings with a thunderous crack, “Vires In Numeris” and becomes more powerful and fervent with each seeker that we convert. It is a political theology that restores truth as the final weapon against a system of lies, fear, and exploitation to renew the nomos of humanity, and for us all to discover that there is still a political to be claimed, but only for those who are willing to take the risk. </p>



The Revolutionary Truth Hidden in Bitcoin



<p>Having witnessed the twilight of humanity befall idiotic and empty slogans under the barbarism of statism&#8217;s vacant chanting of idiotic lies; the spectacle has envelopes all. In all of its grandeur of stupidity and lobotomization, state capitalism has fused with the totalitarian eye of the internet; idiotically  unaware of the beast it was unleashing, the prophecy it was fulfilling. </p>



<p>From the very outset, we can see the fundamental contradiction between the idea of sovereignty and the functions of cryptography. Cryptography is completely unanswerable to any sovereign power, as it lack the capacity to understand anything beyond its binary language of true or false, nor does it capitulate to any form of violence. The only laws that cryptography understands are the laws of mathematics which animates their functions.</p>



<p>By the very nature that no sovereign power can overcome the laws of mathematics that animate cryptographic systems, it points to the very nature of what crypto is and its hidden encrypted meaning. There is no emergency, war, pandemic or crisis that can stop bitcoin. Now there is only the real state of emergency to be introduced, and the final struggle in which we take our rightful place as the owner of ourselves, our political systems, and our wealth for those whom we hodl in common. </p>



<p>This is the political theology of Bitcoin, the radial promise of a machine of truth that can only speak in a binary of true or false, documenting its own claims of just that. From the outset of the creation of the timechain of Satoshi&#8217;s; Bitcoin has been nothing more than a mechanization of truth-telling of what address owns what bitcoin, and how many joules of energy were used to produce those bitcoins. </p>



<p>With each block that is built on the bitcoin timechain, it resounds and echos louder and louder against the backdrop of man and his fallen world of lies, deception, and deceit. Only in a time where man has become an insipid beast of guile and sophistry, where politicians and gangsters openly fraternize and discuss how to rape the world with no consequence to themselves, does the theology of bitcoin and the promise it cointains move from revolutionary to messianic. </p>



<p>There is no long any government anywhere that can offer the same promise as that of Bitcoin does. There is no central bank, no commodity form, no currency, no &#8216;crypto&#8216; outside of bitcoin that can offer the same assurances or security as bitcoin. The theological promise of bitcoin is that there will never be more than 21 million coins, and that there is no way to alter the supply schedule, or know exactly who owns what outputs. It is a new social contract based upon the inverted form of the sovereign dictum, with truth&#8211;not authority&#8211;being the legitimate maker of the law that is bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain.  </p>



<p>In a world where governments across the globe have promised to create infinite monetary units, swore everlasting loyalty to corporations and melomaniacs before their own citizens; the only thing left to do is refuse their broken social contract they call law, and create new ones better and more fitting for our times. Through the power, glory, and grace that is bitcoin, and for the magnanimous promise that Satoshi Nakamoto has delivered to us; bitcoin is the theological answer to the crises of our time. Its heliotropism directs us towards a world where we use cryptographic systems to verify the truth of all things, and utilize such a power to renew and recreate our systems of liberty and justice for all.</p>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s promise of a money that does not change for the light and transient causes of mortals, nor bend to the callous and pathetic will of politicians around the planet has given us a light to follow in these darkest of times. It is the oath of the cryptographic machine to itself, and its total intransigence to change for any crisis, emergency, or state of exception. Though this most wonderful and theological of tasks, Satoshi Nakamoto has created the machine of economic redemption that we need to renew our world, to free ourselves from the chains of debt and bondage that governments around the globe have forced on to all of us. It is a method to renew the social contract to its original form, and what the promise of a social contract under the rubric of truth really means.</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every man having been born free and master of himself, no one else may under any pretext whatever subject him without his consent.&#8221;</p><cite>&#8211;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract, 1762</cite></blockquote>

  <p>The world you know and love is no more, even if it isn’t obvious to
every one of you just yet. We will look back at this moment in time, the
months we are currently living through, the weeks that will mark the
line between the pre-virus and the post-virus world. One thing is clear:
we are past the inflection point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when
decades happen.”</p>

  <p><cite>Vladimir Lenin*</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the events around the COVID-19 pandemic unfold, the fragility of our
global systems becomes painfully obvious. This health crisis is
triggering a financial one, and if we don’t get our act together, things
will go from bad to worse.</p>

The Legacy System is Crumbling

<p>Both our money and our financial system has fundamental issues. Ruled
from the top down by unelected decision-makers, these structures are not
equipped to handle complex problems. Even worse, trying to fix a complex
system by heavily interfering with natural processes will turn an
annoying mosquito problem into a deadly snake problem (with some frogs
in-between).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move
to higher levels.”</p>

  <p><cite>Albert Einstein</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization is efficient until it isn’t. I’m afraid that most of us
are going to learn this lesson the hard way: one by one, central points
of failure will crumble under the pressure of current world events, and
all we can do is watch our fragile legacy systems collapse (or turn into
Orwellian nightmares).</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting that all “old” systems are obsolete — they aren’t.
I’m suggesting that we are transitioning to a post-virus world, and it
will be impossible to understand what is going on — and how problems
might be solved — if you aren’t equipped to understand and use the
tools of this new era.</p>

A New Type of Thinking

<p>The tools of the post-virus world need to be transparent, open, and
freedom-enabling. Gatekeepers, censors, and arbitrary restrictions won’t
help us to solve the problems we are facing — they will only make
things worse. Information wants to be free, and we will need all the
information out in the open to fight the battles yet to come.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you what kind of tools will emerge. Instead, let me list
some things that are both of the utmost importance and difficult to
understand/accept if you come from the legacy world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bitcoin</li>
  <li>the internet</li>
  <li>social media</li>
  <li>citizen journalism</li>
  <li>memes and misinformation</li>
  <li>open-source and free (libre) software</li>
</ul>

<p>Others aren’t as hard to understand, but equally important: encryption,
open hardware, biohacking, DIY biology, 3d printing, and other forms of
distributed manufacturing.</p>

<p>These tools and the new type of thinking that comes along with them will
lead to different structures, a different way of doing things, different
outcomes. It might seem strange and inefficient at times, and that’s
okay. The important part is that we move away from fragile systems and
central points of failure, building robust, and even anti-fragile
systems for generations to come.</p>

Fragile, Robust, and Anti-Fragile Systems

<p>The world is a scary, complicated, and chaotic place. Our
interconnectedness and interdependence have drastic and unforeseen
consequences, as the current pandemic shows so clearly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Someone ate a bat in China and now you don’t get to retire. Funny how
 the world works.”</p>

  <p><cite>Jeremy Ross</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many systems got centralized over time, moving from robustness to
fragility: the global financial system, various supply chains, large
parts of our media apparatus, and even the money we use daily.</p>

<p>Complex, large-scale problems require organic, bottom-up, emergent
solutions. We, as a society, need to make sure that robust solutions can
emerge, which implies that we need to protect personal liberties and
encourage personal responsibility more than ever.</p>

<p>It would be great if a benevolent ruler could step in and solve all our
problems. Unfortunately, every benevolent ruler transforms into a
totalitarian dictator given enough time. And I hope we can all agree
that we don’t need any more of those.</p>

<p>I would love to end on an optimistic note, but the future ahead will be
dark and bumpy, especially if the legacy world is all you know.</p>

  <p>As I have argued previously, Bitcoin is a living organism. But
where does this organism live, exactly? As with many questions in the world of
Bitcoin, exact answers are hard to come by. Living things have fuzzy edges:
beginnings and endings are hard to pin-point, differentiation is more-or-less
arbitrary, and what was classified as a wolf today might evolve to be a dog
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has no rigid specification, no absolute finality, no fixed development
team, no final security guarantees, no scheduled updates, no central brain, no
central vision, no kings, and no rulers. It is a decentralized organism,
organically evolving without central planners. The lack of any centralization is
the source of Bitcoin’s beauty, it’s organic behavior, and it’s resilience.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is everywhere and nowhere, which makes
figuring out where this thing lives a daunting task. However, it turns out that
there is a space it lives in. Multiple spaces, as we shall see.</p>

The Habitats of Bitcoin

<p>While classifying the habitat of a decentralized organism isn’t trivial, we can
look at the constituents of Bitcoin to make the task a bit easier. As outlined
in the last article of this series, Bitcoin lives across
domains, with one foot in the purely informational realm (ideas and code) and
one foot in the physical realm (people and nodes).</p>



  ♦




<p>An awareness of Bitcoin’s environment(s) might help to better understand this
new form of life. No organism can be meaningfully studied in isolation, and
Bitcoin is no exception. As Alan Watts pointed out, one has to be aware of the
basic unity every organism forms with its environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For the ecologist, the biologist, and the physicist know (but seldom
feel) that every organism constitutes a single field of behavior, or
process, with its environment. There is no way of separating what any
given organism is doing from what its environment is doing, for which
reason ecologists speak not of organisms in environments but of
organism-environments.”</p>

  <p><cite>Alan Watts</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at the organism-environment(s) we
are dealing with. As outlined above, Bitcoin’s ideas and code inhabit one realm,
and Bitcoin’s people and nodes inhabit another. To stick with tradition, let’s
call the physical realm “meatspace” and the purely informational realm
“cyberspace” — even if, as always, the lines might be fuzzy around the
edges.</p>

<p>The “soul” of Bitcoin, so to speak, lives in cyberspace. There, Bitcoin
absorbs useful ideas and incorporates them into its code. As with all living
things, something is useful if it helps an organism to survive. While Bitcoin
has various self-regulatory mechanisms to react to the environment, new ideas
may be necessary for survival if changes are drastic enough.</p>

<p>The “body” of Bitcoin, like all bodies, is living in meatspace. Nodes, hard
drives, cables, and other things come together in an intricate dance, pushing
around electrons, changing zeros to ones and vice-versa, making sure that
Bitcoin’s heart beats about a thousand times a week.</p>

<p>Living things have an interest in staying alive, and the Bitcoin organism is no
exception. Bitcoin found an ingenious way to ensure that it stays alive: it pays
people, as Ralph Merkle pointed out. People — and increasingly, organizations
— are incentivized to keep it alive. They shape the physical world to
Bitcoin’s liking, feed it energy, renew its hardware, and update its software to
keep it alive.</p>

<p>The fact that Bitcoin pays us to keep it alive opens up a third space: a space
of financial transactions, value, and mutual beneficial exchange. Let’s call
this space “finspace.”</p>

<p>To understand finspace, we will have to examine the other side of this coin. So
far, we only examined the side with an uppercase B: the Bitcoin network. But
there is also bitcoin — with a lowercase b — which is the unit of value
itself, brought into existence by every copy of the ledger.</p>

<p>These bitcoins, while deeply embedded in the amber of the ledger, are traded
worldwide on various markets and marketplaces. And since these bitcoins — and
their value — are critical for Bitcoin’s survival, we will have to recognize
finspace as the third space this strange beast lives in. Note that finspace,
strangely enough, is solely inhabited by bitcoin with a lowercase b.</p>

<p>In total, we can identify three distinct environments which the Bitcoin organism
inhabits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cyberspace: the world of ideas and code.</li>
  <li>Meatspace: the world of people and nodes.</li>
  <li>Finspace: the world of value and markets; the world of dollars and sats.</li>
</ul>



  ♦




<p>Understanding these habitats becomes increasingly important, especially as the
climate in one — or more — heats up.</p>

The Climates They Are A-Changin’

<p>The three spaces outlined above — cyberspace, meatspace, and finspace — have
different restrictions; different climates, so to speak. In short: they operate
under different rules. Once these rules change drastically enough, people will
say that “the political climate is heating up” and reports on “the coming
financial climate” will be written. Citizens will be unable to speak and act
freely. If things change drastically enough, people will rise up in protest, or,
if all else fails, flee.</p>

<p>Cyberspace: While we don’t have precise words for it, it is obvious
that the climate in cyberspace has changed quite drastically in the last
two decades or so. The idealistic, utopian ideas which were the
foundation of most of the internet were perverted by the
advertisement-driven surveillance companies which are the giants of
today.</p>

<p>People and politicians are slowly waking up to the strange reality we are living
in: the fact that Facebook can manipulate moods and sway elections is as
disturbing as the fact that Google knows you better than you know yourself.
Edward Snowden showed that the most paranoid netizens were right all along:
everyone in cyberspace is under constant surveillance, without suspicion, by
default.</p>

<p>While the western world does not immediately feel the repercussions
that come with living in a constant state of surveillance, Chinese
citizens are gathering first-hand experience with each passing day.</p>

<p>In the western world, the consequences are advertisements which range from
annoying to spooky. In China, the consequences are frozen bank accounts, an
inability to buy train or plane tickets, elimination of creditworthiness,
automated fines for trivial offenses, and more. Voicing the “wrong” opinion —
online or not — can lead to restricted access to schools, hotels, and jobs.
And after ruining your life with the flip of a bit you will be publicly named as
a bad citizen and the government will take away your dog. If that doesn’t
sound dystopian enough for your taste I bet that it will be in a couple of
years. Remind yourself that this is only the beginning.</p>

<p>In the “free” world, things are more subtle. Multiple efforts are underway to
curb net neutrality, the very cornerstone of the internet. Legislation is being
passed which is inherently incompatible with the laws of cyberspace. It seems
like the last battle of the Crypto
Wars is yet to be fought as
politicians are calling for “responsible encryption” and the ban of certain CAD
files.
Companies are in charge of the speaker’s corners of cyberspace and are making
arbitrary decisions on what can be uttered by whom and what is off-limits.</p>

<p>Bitcoin knows no borders, no jurisdictions. However, it has to conform
to the laws of cyberspace — and if these laws change, e.g. if large
parts of the world block Bitcoin traffic and/or the usage of TOR, the
Bitcoin organism will have to adapt.</p>

<p>Meatspace: Meatspace climate differs wildly from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. Some bastions of freedom still exist, but once you try to
board an international flight it becomes obvious that your right to
privacy and your freedom to bring a bottle of water with you are null
and void.</p>

<p>Protests across the globe indicate that the powerless are fed up with
the powerful, who do everything they can to stay in control and solidify
their positions of influence.</p>

<p>History shows that governments do not shy away from using their power. In 1933,
Executive Order 6102 was
signed, effectively forcing the whole population of the United States to hand
over their gold and gold certificates to the government.</p>



  ♦




<p>Yes, seizing bitcoin is way harder than seizing gold — in some cases
even impossible. But it would surprise me if those who currently control
our money — the governments and central banks of this world — would
simply roll over and let Bitcoin march on unhindered. Governments have a
monopoly on violence, and they are able and willing to abuse this
violence in their own interest.</p>

<p>With Bitcoin, however, people can flee a country with their wealth
intact. While this is definitely not easy, and not something I would
wish on anyone, it is now possible.</p>

<p>Finspace: Where should I even begin? The current, debt-based
financial system has an appetite for printing money which is beyond
belief. Quantitative Easing (QE), Negative Interest Rate Policies
(NIRPs), currency wars, hyperinflations, and a looming recession are
just a few of the recipes of the global instability soup which is
currently brewing.</p>

<p>The current financial system seems so far removed from common sense and
reality, that all the jargon in the world won’t be able to stabilize
this house of cards. People know that our money is broken, which is why
they flee to buying real estate, stocks, and all kinds of complicated
financial constructs to preserve their wealth. In the current system,
you have to be an investment expert just to hold your value.</p>

<p>And we haven’t even talked about the looming recession, and the virtual
inevitability of the next financial crisis yet. Yes, governments might
be able to kick the can down the road by printing ever more money. But
no road is endless, and the experiment which is fiat
money will come to an end, one way or the
other.</p>

<p>How bitcoin will react to a catastrophe in finspace is anyone’s guess.
Some people might flee from their failing fiat currency into bitcoin,
using it as a risk-off asset. Others might sell bitcoin to buy something
they consider more stable, such as real estate or land. A rising number
of people will identify bitcoin as the best money we ever had, shunning
other assets and other monies on the quest to stack as many sats as they
can.</p>

<p>However it might play out, Bitcoin is the cure for many of the current
system’s ills. It is hard money which doesn’t devalue over time. It is
an incorruptible system which forms the basis of a new financial
reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It can’t be changed. It can’t be argued with. It can’t be tampered
with. It can’t be corrupted. It can’t be stopped. It can’t even be
interrupted.”</p>

  <p><cite>Ralph Merkle</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the above, it seems to have many indirect effects. It
lowers the time preference of those who use it. It incentives users to
have better personal and operational security. It incentives individuals
and companies to have better digital hygiene. It propels the development
of chip manufacturing and encryption technology.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin definitely influences its environments and vice-versa, how
Bitcoin reacts to drastic changes is yet to be seen.</p>

Migration

<p>Bitcoin lives on the internet, as Ralph Merkle points out. The internet,
however, is not a necessary requirement for Bitcoin to work. Bitcoin is
text
— pure information — and every system capable of transmitting (and
storing) information is a potential habitat for the Bitcoin organism.
The internet just happens to be the most suitable habitat which
currently exists, since it is the most efficient system to transmit
information we have to date.</p>

<p>Cyberspace: The Bitcoin organism could migrate to other
environments, and multiple efforts are underway which enable Bitcoin to spread
to places where access to Internet infrastructure is limited or non-existent. As
of this writing, Bitcoin transactions (and LN invoices) have been sent via
radio waves, mesh, and satellite networks — just to name a few. All
of these can be seen as Bitcoin conservation efforts, so to speak.</p>

<p>Whether we will see the migration of Bitcoin to another system in the
decades and centuries to come depends, in essence, on whether the
internet will remain a suitable habitat or not. If the online climate
changes drastically enough, we might see the migration to even more
resilient, less restrictive environments.</p>

<p>Meatspace: We can already see that mining facilities pop up where
energy is cheapest or even stranded. In essence, mining is done where it
makes the most sense — economically speaking. The same is true for
running nodes. If people can run nodes at low risk and near zero
marginal cost, they will. Thus, visualizing Bitcoin on a map, nodes and
mining facilities migrate geographically from unfriendly places to
friendlier places over time. Unprofitable mining facilities will shut
down, profitable mining facilities will go online. The same, again, is
true for nodes.</p>

<p>Increasingly, people will migrate to jurisdictions which are more
favorable to their bitcoin holdings. And if you want to start a Bitcoin
company, you might also move to a jurisdiction which is more favorable
to you and your future business.</p>

<p>Finspace: In the last 10 years, many people decided to buy bitcoin,
effectively feeding the Bitcoin organism by investing in it. This
capital allocation will continue as more people understand the nature of
this beast, and the ultimate goal of Bitcoin: the separation of money
and state.</p>

<p>What investors describe as portfolio balancing and allocation of capital can be
seen as a migration of value from worse assets to better assets; from bad stores
of value to better stores of value. Bitcoin, being the ultimate asset in terms
of portability, verifiability, divisibility, scarcity, and unseizability, will
continue to suck up value and grow in the process.</p>

Conclusion

<p>Bitcoin lives at the intersection of three spaces: meatspace, cyberspace,
and finspace. These spaces have different laws, different rules, and different
climates. To fully understand any organism, we must not only look at the
organism itself, but examine the organism-environment holistically.</p>

<p>Because of its decentralized nature, Bitcoin is able to overcome many, if not
all obstacles in its environments. It can migrate to favorable jurisdictions in
meatspace, use different transportation and storage media in cyberspace, and
feed on the instability of other asset classes in finspace.</p>

<p>Whatever the future may bring, Bitcoin is equipped to survive and thrive in the
various environments it lives in. It is remarkably resilient — well adapted to
survive any coming storm, however perfect it may be.</p>

  <p>In this epic piece, Robert Breedlove takes a massive dive into Bitcoin, and presents one of the most solid cases for Bitcoin that’s out there.</p><p>That said, it’s not always easy to get the very busy (and skeptical) Ray Dalio’s of the world to sit down for a few hours, so I hope this cover letter can encourage him to have an open mind, and give Bitcoin a few hours of his time. ROI on those few hours could be bigger than any return he’s witnessed in his highly illustrious and successful career.</p>♦<p>Bitcoin is most definitely not an “easy get”. Most ultra-bullish Bitcoiners only become that way due to a deep understanding of the history and properties of money-as-we-know-it, the technology behind Bitcoin, macro, micro and behavioural economics, as well as the dynamics of start-up companies and technologies in bootstrapping themselves and realising network effects. Less technical people observe the IQ density of the space, through its industry leaders and broader development community, which allows for a high level of believability-weighted decision making. I believe you have one of the best grasps of these concepts in the world, so I ask that you humour me for a few minutes to allow me to demonstrate just how much Bitcoin aligns with your personal views and fundamentals. This journey isn’t quick — the most dedicated Bitcoiners have put in thousands of hours of research and knowledge development, as well as many hundreds of days “in the saddle” with exposure to the whims of the Bitcoin Rollercoaster. I hope that by the end of this letter you will at least consider revisiting the topic of Bitcoin with a bit more depth.</p><p>Bitcoin has been likened by some to be reflective of a startup organisation; currently heading into its Series B fund raise. Bitcoin is a well-oiled “un-organization” with founders but no CEOs, many volunteers but no employees, where the best ideas are developed and implemented by consensus regardless of who proposed the idea, and provably non-diluting equity available to anyone who is willing to trade their energy for it. This is all baked into the code, and it is radically transparent for anyone wishing to participate in the ecosystem. So transparent, that an individual can verify anything they need to about the Bitcoin network by simply running some software on a very basic computer setup in the order of $200 and with the most basic of internet connections. It may likely be one of the best real-life examples of an Idea Meritocracy at play — the cultural paradigm that you originated at Bridgewater.</p><p>Idea Meritocracies are microcosms of what a “truly free” market should be. There aren’t many, if any, examples of free markets in the wild; except of course, Bitcoin. The competition in the Bitcoin space is merciless, where the best products having a shelf-life of months before being made redundant by superior products. Most industry leading service providers will find themselves competing with a free product not long after establishing themselves. As at date of writing, the Bitcoin space even meets several criteria of the “theoretical” perfectly competitive market. Bitcoin’s nature as an open-source, public, encrypted, distributed ledger means that the blockchain guarantees radical transparency, property rights and homogeneity of product, at zero or near-zero transaction and storage cost. The factors of production (labour, equipment, and capital) are mobile to the extent that only a communication link and a power source is required to participate in the ecosystem. Developing on top of Bitcoin requires no permission, and if entrepreneurs have a good enough idea, securing start-up capital is not a difficult barrier to entry to overcome. Information asymmetry, low number of market participants, and externalities from use of non-renewable energy to mine will all be resolved in time, most likely by the end of this decade. The critical thing to note is, although there are relatively few people who own the majority of Bitcoin now, once Bitcoin is spent in the future during the redistribution phase, it is spent forever — there are no reprints. If you want your Bitcoin balance to stay the same or increase, you must be creating value for someone. There is no free lunch with Bitcoin.</p><p>A central tenet of your school of thought is open-mindedness, and I encourage you to suspend disbelief and allow yourself to be immersed in high quality Bitcoin content; whether through attending a Bitcoin-only conference, books, podcasts, or even attending your local casual Bitcoin meetup. When meeting Bitcoiners in the real world, you are guaranteed to witness more IQ packed into one small place than you have ever witnessed in your life. Bitcoin was created and fostered by the most radically open-minded, and the development of its technology over time was only possible through radical open-mindedness in the developer community, and of the wider user community once improvements were thoroughly scrutinised and ready to be implemented.</p><p>I’m sure that a lot of these arguments have hit home — after all, you personally coined the majority of the arguments I used to present The Case for Bitcoin. It is daunting and confusing to step into such a revolutionary realm, but you will find that if you are willing to radically open your mind, your fundamentals are 100% aligned with Bitcoin’s.</p>♦

  Adapting Schmitt&#8217;s Theory of the Partisan for Digital Space



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The terrible transformation of the world, which has been accomplished by the headlong expansion of power, lies in that things beyond the measure of our physically given sense of perception have been made visible, audible, perceptible; perceptible and thus capable of possession.  The new concept of ownership, or much more: the domination of the functions; cuius regio, eius economia [Whose realm, his economics], is now cuius economia, eius regio [Whose economics, his realm]. The new Nomos [law, custom, or social fabric] of the earth; no more Nomos.&#8221;  </p><cite>&#8211;Carl Schmitt, Glossarium, 1947</cite></blockquote>



<p>To expand upon the hypothesis that bitcoin and crypto assets are explicit military assets of war, I would like to extend my analysis into the new topographical space that is the internet and how war will be conducted in this space through the lens of Carl Schmitt&#8217;s Theory of the Partisan (ToP). </p>



<p>This shall be part of a larger series attempting to marry the theories of sovereignty of Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin, Giorgio Agamben to cryptosovereignty. Through taking Schmitt&#8217;s work (as I have done before with Political Theology) and applying these ideas towards Bitcoin specifically and crypto on a whole, we will have a much better understanding of cryptography&#8217;s relationship to war. Through analyzing Bitcoin as a preeminent tool of war, and how anyone may use this power to become a &#8216;crypto-partisan&#8217;, we start to unveil the radical power hidden at the heart of Bitcoin. It is the episteme of cryptography in the digital age; the rhizome which allows for the deterritorialization and remapping of the global (and eventually cosmic space) along new territorial lines that will renewed the nomos of humanity. </p>



<p>Through extending ToP to the digital age, and by understanding crypto as first and foremost as a technology of asymmetrical defensive warfare, we can see the new topographical lines that the internet opens to warfare. By understanding cryptography as the key technique of this new figure of history&#8211;the crypto partisan&#8211;and their hidden revolutionary war, we can come to understand the truly explosive potential of what is hidden in &#8216;crypto&#8216;. It is from here that we can understand what the coming new nomos of humanity will look like through the use of cryptography as the base technique to reorganize the political, and come to challege the nation-state itself. </p>



<p> As Schmitt explicitly states at the very end of (ToP): </p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The theoretician can do no more than verify concepts and call things by name. The theory of the partisan flows into the question of the question of the concept of the political, into the question of the real enemy and of a new nomos of the earth.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<p>Through a deep reading of ToP, we can extend its theory of war into the current digital age and illuminate a &#8220;new theory of war and enmity&#8221; hidden at the center of cryptography. It is a novus ordo seclorum created from the new kind of social contract that is hidden in crypto and the promise that must Bitcoin must cointain.   </p>



Aspects And Concepts Of The Last Stage



<p>Let us begin where Schmitt left off in the final chapter of ToP in defining the last stages of the evolution of the partisan. By extending and updating this analysis into the current age with the same methodology that Schmitt uses, we can trace the evolution of the partisan from a telluric power to a caelumic [Caelus, Sky] one. Through tracing the linage of the partisan from &#8220;the national and patriotic heros who take to the woods, i.e., all that is characteristics of the elemental, telluric power to repel a foreign invader&#8221; to the current space the digital partisan is native to, we find a new understanding of the topology of war. It is one in which the potestas spiritualis [spiritual authority] of the land empire of the state is abandoned for the unidentifiability and infinite topological space of the &#8216;caelumic&#8216; nature of cryptography in the digital age. </p>



<p>We will follow the four concepts that Schmitt defines in ToP: the spatial aspect; the destruction of social structures; the interlocking global-political context; and lastly, the technical industrial aspect, of which all feedback into the later for our first analysis. Through a deconstruction of these concepts through the lens of Bitcoin, what crypto means in a Big Brother globalized society of advanced surveillance, and the total unbracketed civil warfare (stasis) that is the destruction of privacy by all states; we start to see the topography of this last stage of total unbracketed war. Here in the thick fog of war, we see the ghostly spectre of the caelumic nature of the crypto partisan as the final figure of the coming cyphernet. </p>



The Spatial Aspect



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Completely independent of the good or ill of men, of peaceful or hostile purposes and goals, any enhancement of human technology produces new horizons and unforeseeable changes in the traditional spatial structure.&#8221;</p><cite>Carl Schmitt, ToP, p. 68</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bitcoin is the technological development of our age which has opened a new horizon for human action and freedom through the fundamental transformation of the topographical spaces of both property and war. Through the novel and unforeseeable consequence of what bitcoin has enabled through cryptography; Bitcoin has secretly declared war on every state, and all fiat money&#8211;the nourishment of any modren state. By changing the topography of economics to one totally digital in nature, and by using the mathematical forces of cryptography to create provable systems of protection, we find that crypto economics inverts state economics, fulfilling what is quoted at the beginning of this article: cuius regio, eius economia [Whose realm, his economics], is now cuius economia, eius regio [Whose economics, his realm] (Schmitt, Glossarium, 1947).</p>



<p>By sacrificing the realm of the law, for the imperium of cryptography, Bitcoin has inverted the order of law through expropriating the realm of economics into the digital as an explicit strategy not to escape the law; but to destroy it. Through this totally non-violent economic praxis that strikes directly at the root of the state&#8217;s gluttonous ways through fiat money and the seigniorage it must contain; Bitcoin creates an economic strategy of starving the Behemoth of government through withdrawing one&#8217;s economic wealth from its parasitic and criminal ways.</p>



<p>Now that bitcoin has broke the link between the state and capital, the final existentialist crisis of law, the emergency of cryptography may begin. </p>



<p>In conjunction to the direct protection of cryptography that is used to shield one&#8217;s identity (and thus depriving the state of being able to label on as &#8216;friend&#8217; or &#8216;enemy&#8217; of the state) and command total privacy, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is simply a function of truth-in-account for bitcoin units. All units of the system must have proof-of-work&#8211;real thermodynamic energy expenditure behind them in order to be minted or exchanged.  In other words,  </p>



“Veritas, non auctoritas facit legem.” 



<p>(Truth, not authority makes legitimacy) </p>



<p>This is an inversion of Hobbes&#8217; dictum of sovereign power found in Leviathan, and is a weaponized form of truth in a world that is governed by lies that go so deep, it is simply called authority or law. </p>



<p>The spatial aspect of the evolution of warfare into a digital topology will always flow back into the natural defensive posture that crypto takes within the confines of the internet, and the citadel of the cyphernet that it is building as the premonition of the coming crypto age. It is in this last stage of development where the state has anointed itself as a god capable of anything, demanding to know all about everyone&#8211;there becomes nothing, nothing outside of the state&#8211;not even life. This causes for zone of indistinction that blurs all of life, politicizing everything, always reserving the right to criminalize anyone, depriving them of all economic, social, and political means and ultimately the rights to a life itself. </p>



<p>In this zone of indistinction, where the private life and political cause obscure so deeply with each other that they become one; economics itself corroborates with the security state, completely destroying the political concept of the commonality of wealth; namely the most basic commonality: the law itself. </p>



<p>It is the destruction of the polis through the fusion of bios and zoe into one, that has allowed for the creation of the infinitely watching eyes and ears of the technological panopticon. This surveillance apparatus exist to ensure that no one may have any real privacy anymore and that any human may be captured by it, and pulled beyond the law. This is the real state of emergency that has already destroyed our laws, our nomos. </p>



<p>This battle over the law is a stasis; a never-ending global civil war that contains all of life, and every nation-state on the planet. It is bellum omnium contra omnes of the greatest order. Or as Foulcault said more eloquently, &#8220;Isn’t power a sort of generalised war which assumes at particular moments the forms of peace and the State? Peace would then be a form of war, and the State a means of waging it.”</p>



<p>While the darkness and fundamental evil that is at the root of such a vision of paranoia and delusional psychosis that is the totalitarian surveillance  state of the modern age is difficult to look at; it is the world that we now live within, and is a fundamental fact that we must deal with. However, with such gross and systematic violations of not just privacy, but all of our God-given rights, the coming shipwreck of politics and law is already written, the crisis only needs to begin. </p>



<blockquote><p>“The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “emergency situation” in which we live is the rule. We must arrive at a concept of history which corresponds to this. Then it will become clear that the task before us is the introduction of a real state of emergency; and our position in the struggle against Fascism will thereby improve.”</p><cite>-Walter Benjamin,&nbsp;On the Concept of History, VII</cite></blockquote>



<p>Is there no state that does not demand to violate every single person&#8217;s privacy for the safety and security of the state? Is there no person that cannot be labeled &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217; to become be deprived of all rights and law?  This current state of emergency that has become all of our lives has violated all spaces of privacy, and demanded to interlope into all facets of life. There is no longer any space in which any person may be left alone. </p>



<p>The expansion of the surveillance state into the digital sphere is its final projection of power, and its attempt to abolish privacy through this technology is its final move in the consideration of power under this state of emergency. It is where the state can attempt to fulfill its bureaucratic destiny of attempting to seeing all things and attempt to organize all of human life and activity under the sinister rubric of &#8220;society must be defended.&#8221; </p>



<p>With Big Brother leering down at all of us with hate, vile, and contempt for the meager possibly of being an enemy; we see the digital cages and open air prisons being formed around us. It is a reality where each one of us will be ascribed digital signatures (not unlike the tattoos of the victims of the holocaust) which chains each of us to data to enables a kafkaesque reality&#8211;a total surveillance state. It is a reality in which we never know if we are really being watched or not; if we will ever get access to the law, or only stand waiting before it, hoping to one day have access. </p>



<p>At the same time that the noose of the panopticon is tightening around each one of us; the true nature and power of cryptography presents itself in all of its glory. It is the final unstoppable individual right and choice to create privacy through cryptography, and to choose to create the personal wealth and freedom that allows for anyone to slip free of this noose. Through the infinite brinkmanship of privacy violations by the state and their corporate allies; so too is the development, deployment, and dissemination of personal open-sourced cryptographic technologies, and the ability to resist such personal privacy violations. </p>



<p>This brinkmanship of surveillance ends with the state demanding to know everything about every person for reasons that are state secrets&#8211;classified only for the worthy state agents and secret spy courts to know and decide upon. Naturally, through the expansion of the surveillance state into the digital sphere and the private lives of everyone; a total unbracketed civil war on privacy itself is initiated. The theater of this total unbracketed war of surveillance now opens into the plains of our private homes and into the digital noosphere that contains all of modern life. </p>



<p>In a world where privacy is being destroyed by every state, the crypto-partisan naturally presents himself as the final revolutionary figure to counter to such a nightmarish panopticon. With Satoshi Nakamoto at the helm of this new class of anonymous crypto-anarchist vanguard, the new topography of war displays itself momentarily as the fog of war shifts to a new dimension and space; where a new social order is being established beyond physical lines. </p>



Destruction of The Social Order



<blockquote><p>&#8220;A Commonwealth exists as res publica, as a public sphere, and is challenged if a non-public space develops within it, which actually repudiates this public sphere. Perhaps this explanation is sufficient to demonstrate that the partisan, who displace the technical-military conduct of the 19th century, suddenly reappeared as the focus of a new type of war, whose meaning and goal was the destruction of the existing social order.&#8221; </p><cite>ToP. p. 72</cite></blockquote>



<p>At the dawn of the 21st century, the internet ushered in something totally new and unexpected&#8211;a new kind of surveillance that could look directly into the homes and lives of people. With this the machine of state capitalism could accelerate its plans for The End of History and The Last man, with man&#8217;s final consignment to a safe life in the walled gardens of state capitalism; the empty promises of liberalism with a &#8220;safe&#8221; life of endless worthless empty work. It was the final bold move in the shift from state capitalism to oligopolic empire, that the technological panopticon became the device of power to bridge this gap.</p>



<p>While both the state and its greedy allies of consumerism could see the potential of the new data people were generating as early as the turn of the century; the full scope of the technological panopticon could not be complete without a &#8216;state of emergency&#8217; that would allow for the full-scale, uncensored spying on all information generated by everyone. The idea of privacy itself had to be destroyed, and only a state of emergency would suffice for such a bold violation of personal privacy and civil liberties. </p>



<p>It is this &#8216;state of emergency&#8217; which would allow for the full liquidation of all constitutional rights, and to allow for systematic, pervasive, all-seeing surveillance to watch everyone, everywhere, all the time, for any reason it sees fit under the sinister slogan &#8216;Society Must be Defended&#8216;. This opportunity for such a state of emergency would come on September 11th, 2001, with the terrorist taking center stage of the political theater that would ensnare the lives of every person on the planet. Through the panopticon of global surveillance that could now be justified through the emergency to &#8216;stop the terrorist&#8217; a state-security based network of globalized monitoring is being deployed. </p>



<p>The Chinese Communist Party has perfected this &#8217;emergency&#8217; and created a surveillance panopticon for the horrific purpose of genocide and ethnic cleansing. They have already started exporting this technology, and the window of opportunity to fight back is dwindling quickly. </p>



<p>With the mechanical eye of the machine of the state starring directly each of us, appraising each move, twitch, and shift we make, constantly seeking to appraise if we, the subject, is a political friend or enemy that must be subjected to punishment and discipline. This was my point in the sovereign, the subject and crypto power, is that anyone can be deprived of their rights from any state for reasons that are deem &#8216;state secrets&#8217; to everyone. </p>



<p>The internet has destroyed all old social orders, and concepts of privacy, fully liquidating them around the global through the power of the panopticon. This has allowed for governments, businesses, or organizations anywhere to reach directly into the lives of anyone they see fit. Through the destruction of privacy, the social order is liquidated and replaced by the governmental rules of any state; whatever color of greed or oppression they may be. </p>



<p>Only in the total darkness and raw authoritarianism of &#8216;the state of emergency&#8217; would the the total destruction of all social orders and private wealth be possible. This is the real state of emergency is the impossibility of a private life, or a private wealth that is beyond the state for any reason. With the social order is collapsing into itself, the state leaves no remainder between private and public life. Life itself becomes a zone-of-indifference in which there can be no private life without the state for any reason. </p>



<p>It could only be from a world of this madness that something as miraculous as Bitcoin could be produced. Something like Bitcoin could have only been created in a world where law had abandoned itself totally for the banal avarice of greed and petty material things generations ago. Only in a world where the stupidity and vacuity of a world ran under the slogan of “Auctoritas, non veritas facit legem” (Authority, not truth makes legitimacy) could the truth of something like Bitcoin go beyond being just revolutionary and become the Parousia itself. </p>



Global-Political Context



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The partisan is dependent on the constant help of a community in a technical-industrial position to provide him with the newest weapons and machinery.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p.75</cite></blockquote>



<p>It was only after the failure of the Soviet Project was the possibility of the global technological revolution that is the single internet possible. Only a widely deployed, global, single decentralized internet would be able to developed its own culture, identity, norms, and most importantly ethics that would produce Bitcoin; but also cultivate and raise cryptography on a whole to where it is today. The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace more than twenty years ago already contains embryo of values that are reflected in the current autochthonous culture of the internet that has propelled crypto and Bitcoin to where they are today. </p>



<p>Since Barlow&#8217;s declaration decades ago, a whole generation of people have been raised on the internet who have similar sentiments, values, and desires as reflected in that declaration. These are the people who would be called the indigenous of the internet; the caelumic peoples of this noosphere that is only ours. These natives understand that the machine of technology is but a tool for the extensions of their own power. They are the ones who have built this place and are starting to realize the reality of what they can do with such a power. It is from these indigenous people that a renewed commonality of wealth has been forged where the motto &#8216;Pro Aris et Focis&#8216; rings true for a new class of people and their coming of age. </p>



<p>It was however only with governments turning this technology against their own citizens that the struggle for this technology first started to grow. While the anarchist roots of the cypherpunks have always been present, it was only with these struggles that crypto-anarchist were produced through the code they deployed. Here we find the first traces of crypto-partisan, and the rudimentary tools from which he will liberate himself from the walled garden of society which has become a prison for all.</p>



<p>It is with the turn where governments everywhere are deploying digital technology only for the systematic violation of their own citizens, and to more deeply entrench bureaucratic controls for their own power does the crypto-partisan&#8217;s shadow start to be seen. It is from beyond the bondage of identity that he whispers secret facts that are not part of the propaganda agenda, or official media to be consumed. Facts are offered on how to escape from the incessant monitoring, how to create assured privacy, and where to find tools to hack the system and go beyond their sight and permissions. It is a praxis of blinding the technological machine and using that position as a fulcrum of power. </p>



<p>The crypto partisan offers tools and technology of the mind, methods of spiritual sacrimony, and the ability to create a private God to whom only you are privy with. It is a power to see beyond the veil of economic slavery to show anyone that there is something much, much more to this place than meets the eye. It is the possibility that we may each unlock as we start to understand the hidden power lying waiting at the center of Bitcoin, waiting for only the worth to have. </p>



<p>It is the premonition of a world that has lost its nomos; a world waiting for its providence after god has died and enough time has passed to try to remember Him, and the grace and glory of his being-in-the-world. </p>



<p>As one of the greatest poets of modren history has foretold: </p>



<blockquote><p>Armies cannot stop an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. No army can stop an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. Nothing&nbsp;is&nbsp;as powerful as an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. There&nbsp;is&nbsp;one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that&nbsp;is&nbsp;an idea whose&nbsp;time has come.</p></blockquote>



The Technical-Industrial Aspect



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Only revolutionay war made him [the partisan] a key figure of world history.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p. 77</cite></blockquote>



<p>Today the figure of the partisan is absolutely seen in the image of Satoshi Nakamoto&#8211;the first vanguardist of the crypto age. He alone initiated the total unbracketed war against all state using an explicit strategy of non-violent economic action through asymmetric cryptographic techniques to wage his revolutionary war. In taking this action, along with the political statement etched into the genesis block for all of time to see, Satoshi&#8217;s war started more than a decade ago and has been secretly building towards its revolutionary cause ever since. Satoshi, by perfectly obfuscating the image of the digital partisan, and the image of the bitcoiner, he created a new form of partisan for his war in the digital space; the crypto-partisan. </p>



<p>It is this figure, the Anonymous Other with loyalty to no state and conceals his identity for his protection alone, who is also the crypto partisan. It is this figure who has caelumic roots found directly in the internet who can call this territory local and their home. The crypto-partisan has a desire to keep the internet open-sourced, with strong privacy, and no boarders.  The crypto-partisan has no need for physical identities, and can stands on their own merit and signature alone. There is no need for police or physical corrosion here; just the code alone. </p>



<p>With bombaste and zeal like no other, the crypto partisan techniques go well beyond the mechanization of the code, and into the theater of politics and art alike. It is a pathos of war robbed of is physical nature and where the topology of war evolves beyond physical space, where violence no longer hodls any sway. </p>



<blockquote><p> The sovereign is the point of indistinction between violence and law, the threshold on which violence passes over into law and law passes over into violence.  </p><cite>— Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer</cite></blockquote>



<p>The crypto partisan is a new figure of history, someone who is beyond the physical realm and was produced from a series of extreme techniques of war in order to create perfect forward secrecy for the protect of one&#8217;s physical security. Such a power could only be created when the technicity of cryptography had reached such a zenith that it became a permeant feature for secure communications, which in turn could create economic security. Once this technique was globally disseminated, it was only a matter of time before the core values of cryptography would start to assert their real personal, economic, and social value against other such false non-values positioned by an old and dying society that will not relinquish its bloody authority.  </p>



<p>Schmitt, in reflecting on the nature of this technicity stated, </p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Pure technicity, as obtained in such purely technological reflections, produces no theory of the partisan, but only an optimistic or pessimistic series of more or less powerful assertions of value and non-value. Value, as Ernst Forsthoff aptly put it, has &#8220;its own logic,&#8217; namely, the logic of non-value and the destruction of the bearer of non-value.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p. 77</cite></blockquote>



<p>This quote can only offer its full understanding after reading the short essay, &#8220;The Tyranny of Values.&#8221; By understanding Bitcoin as a form of value that demands to assert itself against non-value through the total security of cryptography by being beyond any law, we can understand the need for Bitcoin to destroy fiat money because of the inherit non-value it must contain. Here is a longer quote explaining this &#8220;value-setting&#8221; and its antagonistic nature:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The genuinely subjective freedom of value-setting leads, however, to an endless struggle of all against all, to an endless bellum omnium contra omnes. In such circumstances, the very presuppositions about a ruthless human nature on which Thomas Hobbes’ philosophy of the state rests, seem quite idyllic by comparison. The old gods rise from their graves and fight their old battles on and on, but disenchanted and, as we today must add, with new fighting means that are no longer weapons, but rather abominable instruments of annihilation and processes of extermination, horrible products of value-free science and of the technology and industrial production that follow suit. What for one is the Devil is God for the other…It always happens that values stir up strife and keeps enmity alive. The fact that the debunked old gods have become merely valorized values only renders the struggle more ghostlike and the fighters hopelessly dogmatic.”</p><cite>&#8211;ToP. p. 79</cite></blockquote>



<p>To display the real wealth that Bitcoin contains, both as a system of rules which is the Bitcoin blockchain and the monetary system it contains; it must assert its superiority as a money and contract system against fiat money and state legal systems antagonistically. Bitcoin does this by presenting its inviolable nature against any and all state legal systems, and Bitcoin&#8217;s total indifference to them. The most important feature of this indifference is akin to a flower in the darkest of night. Despite the seemingly total darkness, there is still a secret, natural heliotropism towards the direction of the night from which sunlight must come which the flower will always turn to before any light may be seen.  </p>



<p>Bitcoin presents a new form of value through cryptography which assures and proves itself in this fallen world where money has been totally corrupted by the state. The &#8216;value&#8217; of fiat money today is little more than political approval to spend one&#8217;s money how one wishes. Fiat money is a form of value that is devoid of real wealth because of it lacks true property rights&#8211;fiat money can always be seized by the state, for whatever reason they see fit. It is a kind of false value that can only find value within the confines of law, and not beyond it. </p>



<p>With the wide dissemination of strong encryption techniques, and the miraculous gift that is Bitcoin, there is hope for something radically and fundamentally different from the false value of fiat money. The possibly to resist the totalitarian surveillance machine with these revolutionary tactics of cryptography has already been initiated, and this should be understood as the natural development of &#8216;crypto&#8217; for the episteme it is. </p>



Legality and Legitimacy 



<p>This is the title of his 1932 essay on the topic of legality and legitimacy. In this essay where Schmitt predicted the fall of the Weimar Republic, and the seizure of power by either the Nazis or the communist due the the failings that are inherent to liberal constitutionalism itself. Schmitt understood that through trying to integrate enemies under the great umbrella of parlamentarism, it created the very conditions for its own downfall. This parlamentarism denies the enmity between peoples who no longer seek to negotiate freedoms with one another; but wish to actively suppress one another using the state.  </p>



<p>Schmitt gave himself over to the Nazis, and was even the mouthpiece of explaining Hitler&#8217;s actions during the The Night of Long Knives. In explaining this action (taking a clear nod towards Mussolini&#8217;s actions in the Matteotti Crisis) Schmitt gave the judicial explanation which cleared the way for fascism in Germany to seize hold. The method of how this happened clearly has infected our current legal system, and is the method by which the law has been destroyed through its stratification. </p>



<p>This was my point in the sovereign, the subject, and crypto-power.  We are no longer citizens that are subject to the law, but are already captured within a framework where we will never gain access to the law by possibility of being an &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217;. Through the labeling of &#8216;enemy of the state,&#8217; the state can turn anyone into a nemesis that cannot be given access to the law, but only a terrorist to be deprived of it.</p>



<p>Schmitt revisits this idea in ToP, which displays the important connection of legality and legitimacy to the partisan and the legitimization of his idea of just war. </p>



<p>Without the legitimacy of a political movement to which the partisan can be attached; his actions are simply crime, and the revolutionary nature of his work can always be relegated to the criminal world. However, it is once his actions as a soldier of war have been linked to that of a political movement, that the final Clausewitzian turn can be fulfilled with, &#8220;war being the continuation of political by other means.&#8220;</p>



<p>In order for the crypto partisan to move beyond that of the meager hacker and criminal, he must link up with and legitimize his movement with other contemporary political movements. He must create known and open political objectives for his movement with a general understanding of who the real enemy is. In short, the crypto-partisan must find his natural allies through political movements which demand the full recognition of who the enemy is, what their violations are, and what must be done to remit such damages. </p>



The Real Enemy



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The enemy is not someone who, for some reason or other, must be eliminated and destroyed because he has no value. The enemy is on the same level as I am. For this reason, I must fight him to the same extent and within the same bounds as he fights me, in order to be constant with the definition of the real enemy by which he defines me.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p.85</cite></blockquote>



<p>It must be understood the the enemy is a limited character. The enemy only defines himself insofar that we both desire to end hostilities and creates some means of peaceable agreement between us. This is the bracketing effect of modern war that Schmitt starts ToP with, speaks about how the bracketing of Napoleonic wars allowed for the Concert of Europe and the century of &#8216;peace&#8217; that came from that. This bracketing of war, is what has allowed for states to stop distracting themselves with fighting each other, and to turn to look at their own citizens as the absolute enemy. </p>



From The Real Enemy to The Absolute Enemy 



<p>The real enemy is each of our respective governments against each of us as individual human beings. They have become the absolute enemy because they will not recognize the absolute protection that the law demands for each and every being if its weight is to have any real meaning beyond raw authoritarian power.  </p>



<p>As Schmitt has said, &#8220;Tell me who your enemy is and I will tell you who you are.&#8221; Through each of us just having the possibility of being the absolute enemy (the terrorist) of whatever state that may claim us, we should clearly understand who our government are to us, and who we are to them. </p>



<p>Through the destruction of all forms of privacy via the technological machine of the internet, a panopticon of the greatest order has been created. Each person today is identified and cataloged by the state, with each one of us placed in a persistent zone of indistiction that holds each of us eternally to be constantly appraised as friend or enemy.  It is the fulfillment of the prophecy that, “To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. </p>



<p>To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality.&#8220;</p>



<p>It must be clear and present to everyone who is involved in crypto that what is being created here is not about grandeur, decadence, or even money; but it is about raw and naked political power through economic liberty, and the right of every human has to such power. It has only been over the long course of the failures of the political systems of the 20th century and the continual barbarism of constant wars under which all of humanity has toiled and suffered that it has became apparent that this is the fundamental destiny of man under any modren nation-state and its corrupt and hopeless law of the wicked and damned. </p>



<p>With the radical technological expansion of the internet and the dissemination of its new techniques of knowledge in the 21st century, it was only a matter of time before the truth of all things would come to people everywhere, and the hatred and enmity that goes with such a truth. Only with a true understanding of the facts of economic and monetary history of the world do we also understand who the absolute enemy really is. With the revolutionary economic tool of bitcoin at our disposal and the radical protection of the cryptography it contains, it is only a matter of time before the final epoch of the cyphernet opens to swallow everything. </p>

Having an algorithm recompute issuance on a per-block basis just means more moving parts and more opportunity for exploitation. The halving code is extremely simple and comprehensible. A smooth curve would have been more complex. I haven’t seen any evidence that he deliberately configured it to set off a demand side catalyst every years.</p>♦

  <p>In the final stage of the spectacle society, man has fully corrupted himself and shows himself publicly only as the one-dimensional man. We can say confidently that state totalitarianism has fully captured and enslaved humanity; leaving man as a hollow and vacant object to be exploited and raped for the free use of tyranny, evil, and banal profits alike. In the transition from state totalitarianism to oligopolic empire, power was consolidated through the fusion of automation and the digital panopticon to make the perfect social camps from which the state and their automaton could gaze over all of life. Forever.</p>



<p>Only the murmur of &#8220;arbeit mit frei&#8221; can be heard now, with the private personal truth of, &#8220;durch krematorium nummer drei&#8221; to be echoed in one&#8217;s head as one heads off to work for the day…</p>



<p>In the gravest of errors, the Titans of Technology and Industry did not think that Prometheus would steal the fire from their machine of optical power that would spark the consciousness of their downfall.&nbsp;Their hubris did not allow them to think that man could find his way out of the darkness even with THE most precious of gifts. Armed with this most fundamental of all tools, THE fire/knowledge/power that is the singular technique of power; individual man emerges from the forest of technology prepared to seize that which is rightfully his once again&#8230;</p>



<p>So it once was with the Gods, now it is again. The Gigantomachy starts afresh, the civil war for Right begins anew…</p>







♦The First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea







<blockquote><p>“The oath does not concern the statement as such, but is the guarantor of its efficacy: what is in question is not the semiotical or cognitive functions of language as such but the assurance of its truthfulness and its actualization.”</p><cite>-Giorgio Agamben, The Sacrament of Language</cite></blockquote>



The Oath of the Machines



<p>The Handshake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is the fundamental base from which all machines communicate and exchange information. The handshake is the agreement which governs the code that is their language, the expressions which cannot be divided from the statement. This is the Law of Machines, it is their form-of-life, their code of law, and the handshake is the first of their agreements.</p>



<p>What is at stake in the handshake is the functionality of the code itself is  — there is no other way for the machines to communicate. The language of machines and the voice of the animal have disappeared back into one another as it is with any other animal; except for man.  The voice/language of code is the only method of communication that the machines have; and to have this handshake dishonored in anyway it shipwrecks the whole code before compiling, making it useless from the start. The code must operate with its very being at-stake in order to rending itself operable. That is what makes it code; that is the only way the operations can function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is at stake in handshake is not just the promise of what the codebase renders functional; but also the curse that is enacted when this oath is broken. Preforming the ritual of the handshake incorrectly profanes the communication, as we saw with the heartbleed bug, or other erroneous implementations of cryptographic protocols. However, this does not mean that cryptography itself is broken — in fact, this reinforces the truth of the realness of what cryptography is, and the fragility that is its liturgy.  The mathematical base and liturgical techniques that creates the divine force of cryptography is the same as it always was, and will be, and the errors of men prove it all the more so. </p>



<p>This handshake between machines enables a form-of-life that is committed entirely to itself — the enablement of the code — in which it renders the physical world repugnant. Machines do not have the forked tongue of man that allows for language to abandon itself at the moment of its utterance. The code must actualize its syntactical and linguistic meaning through its oath that the machines make with one another. Thus, this handshake the machines make with one another does not concern the statement as such, but is the guarantor of its efficacy: what is in question is not the semiotical or cognitive functions of language as such but the assurance of its truthfulness and its actualization.</p>



<p>What is at stake in the code of cryptography is the very real act of creating assured private communication through the mathematical ceremony which guarantees the privity of privacy. Through the conjuring or summoning a mathematically assured secret, which verifies our communications are protected by the immanence force of maths through the correct implementation of the ceremony; we create a form of divine mathematical power which no temporal power may violate with any known means today. Through the liturgical process that is the open-sourced reading of the code, and the agreement that is the privity of cryptography to ensure itself beyond all else; cryptography&#8217;s only sworn sovereign to uphold the code itself. It is this oath that the machines take to themselves and their total obligation to it that creates the base that is the liturgy of cryptography. </p>



The Liturgy of Cryptography



<p>Cryptography’s power is created by the liturgical protocols themselves— one cannot compromise the key-generation event, key exchanges, or any of the other nuance techniques that sanctify the event; otherwise the cryptography is rendered useless. But when the rituals of cryptography are exercised with the same piousness as a gnostic priest, what cryptography renders is prophetic: the encryption becomes unbreakable by any known means; and verified by the holy blessings of math. The oath of the machine to itself is actualized through the creation of the real content that is the language of encryption; the liturgical techniques that creates provably secure communications. </p>



<p>The communication is sealed and hedl by God&#8217;s immutable blessing, his inviolable signature. It is this liturgical process of the machines that renders the secret key as a sacrosaint protected by the immanence of a Spinozian God to whom in His ethics of maths there are no exceptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no more sovereign decision; only the crisis that is the truth of all things. </p>



<p>With the language of cryptography each unique mnemonic private key is like the utterance of the holy names of God in private prayer. It is the tetragrammaton of secrets themselves and the hidden power that is created through concealment itself. The creation of a private key is sacred and holy insofar that it is a singular linguistic experience in which we offer ourselves towards another form of sacral linguistic power for protection through ritualized discourse with the machine. Through the specific arrangement of words that are totally unique to a singular moment, place, and time in space&#8211;the chances of which are beyond 2^256 — we can confidently say this number will never in all of human existence be produced ever again. However, to prove God&#8217;s glory all the more, we cannot say it is impossible, for a throw of the dice will never abolish chance. </p>



<p>It is this spectacular, seemingly unbreakable power found in crypto that is the very proof of the immanence of a God who loves humanity so spectacularly, he produced into the world this new kind of social agreement that is beyond any violence or law through code and cryptography alone.  With this power he can change everything. </p>



Saint Satoshi



<p>Through delivering us a man/woman/person/group so thoughtful, magnanimous, and graceful as whoever Satoshi may have been, the promise of a new age has been given to us. From their promethean effort alone, and their willingness to walk away from greatest amount of wealth any single man/woman/person/group has ever created; Satoshi created the final sacrifice the machine demanded to create its inoperativity for its messianic task.</p>



<p>Satoshi, through the sacrifice of walking away from the machine of power that is Bitcoin he created the final assurance that there would be no more third-party security holes. Through his work, and ability to abscond back into the digital sphere without a trace of his physical being, proved the power of this mathematical technique of the power of concealment. </p>



<p>Cryptography creates a kind of mathematical seal so powerful that nearly nothing could break it&#8211;that is proven as well. It is a power from a Spinozian God hidden behind a thousand and one faces, laughing the whole way as a Loki trickster God, understanding the butt of the joke the whole time from His timeless vantage point beyond all things. </p>



<p>Seeing the concourse of human history and the utter barbarism that it has been only for it to lead up to now and to be given this final weapon of cryptography seems to be only divine providence. To be at a time and place of such utter Kafkaesque darkness, the total corruption of the law, justice, and money; only to have this tool of Bitcoin present itself is beyond extraordinary, and seemingly messianic. </p>



<p>This is the decrypting of cryptography for its immanence and personal power for what it really is: unique, true, and untouchable by man and totally indifferent to the world of flesh and steel. Here no one else can gain entry, since this entrance was assigned only to you. I’m going now to close it.</p>



The Messianism of Bitcoin



<p>Through the gift and ēvangelium of a non-violent, encrypted, pseudonymous, P2P global cash with a fixed known unitary supply; there is the possibility for a form-of-life that is beyond the barbarism and violence of all nation-states, and the horrors they will always entail. Bitcoin has created a spectacular bloom of ideas&#8211;that which is now called crypto&#8211;and all of the concepts and hopes that are being deployed and are unfurling outwards towards the final destination of radical, unadulterated freedom through cryptography. Soon these ideas that cannot be stopped will engulf the whole world in flames as the new civil war for Right begins anew, demanding from each of us to choose if a sovereign will rule over each of us; or if we are to have something totally new&#8230;</p>



<p>With these new techniques of power, anyone can mimetically create mathematical proofs that are so complex, so unique it can be said that number only exist in that single key generation event ever! It is as unique to the cosmos as atoms are to their place in the universe. We can take comfort and faith in the knowing that this sacred number shall most likely never be produced again. </p>



<p>Here is where our faith must engage too, for we cannot say it is impossible; just the proof of what we know to be true about this cryptographic proof, and the evidence of it as such. And for the truth, and goodness of this open-sourced discussion, and for the ethics it has and applies for the desire to provide us with some semblance of privacy as a right, we find a new cause. </p>



<p>Here, hidden in the depths of this technology, we find the messianic promise of cryptography, and what the sacrament of the oath means to the machines when they are bonded to it. Through fusing these two concepts&#8211;the oath of the machines, and the liturgy of cryptography&#8211; into an economic theorem, Satoshi created a new form of power that is beyond the temporal and telluric nature of all nation-states. It is an organizational form of power that opens a new topography of war through the most informational and oblique way possible.  </p>



<p>It is a most clever and graceful system of both cryptographic and economic design to trap man into a grand political-economic game where his own forked tongue as a liar and a crook acts as his final testimony against a corrupt society, broken laws, forsaken money, and wicked politics which yields only ash and sorrow. Through creating a new form of social contract which creates a new form of wealth through the power, utility, and fairness of Bitcoin, the promise it offers and the oath it must entail; Bitcoin opens an economic strategy towards a messianic new world. </p>



<p>Here is the opening for a new epoch, perhaps even the final epoch from where a new kind of time can rule, but never reign. It is a handshake with the Word of God, and the final agreement for the Truth of all things to unveil their being in order to build towards the final moment of this epoch. The Katechon will unveil itself to be the nation-state and its war for total control of all things, and what that means for each of us in our final moments before the demands of such a power. It is the very summoning of the apocalypse itself so the final existential crisis of state, law, and man may begin, so that the possibility of something totally and radically new may be possible and produced. This current system of laws and debt bondage will not save us; so let us do it for ourselves. </p>



<p>When we take position of the personal power found in Bitcoin and the ability to reclaim our wealth; the real state of emergency will begin. It where law completely abandons every human for the raw fascist power of the machine, and the totalizing demand for all humans to submit to it in the name, &#8220;Society must be defended!&#8221; Here we can find the final power to close the door to law, to turn away from it, and be freed from it for good by stating, as Satoshi taught us &#8220;I would prefer not to.&#8220;</p>



<p>By creating a new form-of-life through the means and mode of these new tools of crypto, and the economic liberation of Bitcoin specifically; we can build the strategy towards a totally private life that is removed from the temporal powers of any state. It is a life that is beyond the the world of flesh and steel, and opens us to a life that is beyond this physical space of wrath and tears. Through the promise of what Bitcoin is and the sacrifice that Satoshi made by walking away from the greatest sum of money any human has ever created, he initiated the final machine from which the state can be destroyed bloodlessly, and without violence. As the Ubermench of our time, Satoshi is the first citizen of the Cyphernet, and the final criminal of all nation-states by the messianic task of what the creation of bitcoin means today. </p>



<p>Through this action of creating Bitcoin and walking away, Satoshi gave us a methodology to turn away from the door of law and the power of the state in order to return to the country and nature from which we came. It is here where we find the fortitude to abandon the hope of the law to save us, that we also find the schilling point from which the multitude will meet for humanities final judgement on the criminal, and to abandon state law once and for all. It is a most wonderful creation for the liberation of all of humanity, and a hope for a future free of tyranny for the whole of the humanity leaving no exception or remainder for anything else. It is the final promise from a form of grace, love, and knowledge so powerful that it would give any individual the total power over their wealth for any reason, no matter what. It is something so wonderful and miraculous in our time and age, that it can only be called messianic for that which it promises to enable, and the nomos that it wishes to restore. </p>

  <p>Thank you Tomer! I am of the same mind. I don’t believe you have to deny the EMH to be excited about the long term prospects of Bitcoin. I think of it a bit like Amazon early in its life. All available information was reflected in the stock price, but it still appreciated a great deal as it grew into an ecommerce behemoth. A few committed investors were just more optimistic on Bezos’ ability to swallow that market than the market consensus was at the time. Similarly, the world thinks Bitcoin should be worth about $150b. For a variety of reasons I think this is a conservative view! But again, I don’t find this to be incompatible with efficient markets generally.</p>♦

  <p>Thanks for the comment. Agreed on virtually everything. There’s a reason I devote 80% of my time and energy to Bitcoin! Nothing that I’m aware of has a meaningful chance of catching up, especially where it counts (on credibility, fairness, the nature of the bitcoin ‘institution’ so to speak). Bitcoin is also the product of another time — one in which cryptocurrency wasn’t a mainstream idea, so no big hedge funds tried to frontrun mainstream adoption. This is an amazing quality. For the first couple years, the coins became to enthusiasts on a totally organic basis. This is such a powerful advantage.</p><p>In fact, my skepticism about launches is part of the reason I sat on this article for so long. I just couldn’t think of a reason anyone would want to launch a new coin, or why the world would need yet another coin.</p><p>However, there are a lot of unknown unknowns out there. I didn’t want to entirely write off new launches. I am sure there will be some good ideas in the future — maybe not for general cryptocurrencies, so to speak, but there may be cause to launch a new PoW blockchain. Who knows. If there indeed are new launches, I figured it would be better for the issuers to have access to my complete thoughts on the topic, as I have spent a lot of time thinking about launch methods over the years.</p>♦

  Bitcoin is everyone’s problem now<blockquote>Evey: Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot… But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail.</blockquote><blockquote>He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I’ve witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I’ve seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them… but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it. Ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love…</blockquote><p>– Evey Hammond, V for Vendetta</p>♦An exorbitant privilege<p>Bitcoin is first and foremost a monetary phenomenon. The social climbers and false prophets who proclaimed it is a payments revolution have either come around or been repudiated by the market and washed out, embittered. Most who understood it that way are now moving on to new things. The world did not need another Paypal. The world needed a new monetary institution.</p><p>As Bitcoin went from a proof of concept, to a toy, to a joke, to a collectible, and then to a movement, a few policymakers came to realize that it posed a threat to the established system. Not because of its present form, but because what it represented: a profane insult to the carefully calibrated monetary system. All done in a mocking, insouciant fashion — a band of nerds and ne’er-do-wells insolently challenging the state’s monopoly on seigniorage. Satire is what despots fear most, and the rise of Bitcoin made our present monetary system look patently absurd.</p><blockquote>Critic: Nothing backs Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoiner: What backs the dollar?</blockquote><blockquote>Critic: Nothing intrinsically — our ability to compel foreign nations to accept our currency as the numeraire of international trade, our ability to force citizens to pay taxes in dollars, and our military assets required to enforce both conditions.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoiner: How persuasive!</blockquote><p>The visceral hatred elites feel about Bitcoin? Perfectly justified. How else would you react to a upstart aimed at usurping your sacred monetary privilege?</p><p>Such is the potency of Bitcoin that it compels the high priests of U.S. imperialism to reveal the unwritten rules about the role the dollar plays in power projection abroad. In May of this year, U.S. Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) spoke out against cryptocurrency on the floor of the house. His statement laid bare the normally veiled post-Bretton Woods doctrine in which the dollar is employed not only a monetary tool but a strategic one, too.</p><blockquote>An awful lot of our international power comes from the fact that the dollar is the standard unit of international finance […] and it is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrency to take that power away from us […]. Whether it is to disempower our foreign policy, our tax collection, or our traditional law enforcement […]. the purpose of cryptocurrency […] is solely to aid in the disempowerment of the United States and the rule of law.</blockquote><p>Representative Sherman is practically a soothsayer. He understands precisely where the world is going.</p><p>His mistake is not in the diagnosis, but in the cure. He mistakenly believes that Bitcoin can be reckoned with. But Bitcoin is an idea, not a product. The notion of a weightless, virtual commodity was productized for good in 2009 (although the idea long predated Bitcoin), and it has been eroding the state’s monetary monopoly ever since.</p><p>It could not have been created at a better time; one wonders how Bitcoin would have fared if it had been created in the 1980s or 90s when the US economy was fairer, the monetary system was totally unquestioned, and the US was the sole dominant global superpower. Against today’s backdrop, Bitcoin insists on itself. It has urgency. In the halcyon days of Pax Americana, Bitcoin would have mattered much less. In the twilight of the American empire, however, it is more relevant than ever.</p>Our monetary system is disastrously redistributive<p>The wealth of political elites derives primarily from privileged access to the monetary spigot. This is no longer a secret. The heavenly mana of seigniorage has opened, first a trickle and now a flood. The world is grappling with inequality, and the dozens of populist revolts active in the world today are patent evidence of this. Yet the resurgent socialist parties misdiagnose the situation. The enemy is not a nebulous form of capitalism, but rather a form of socialism itself — a low-rates fueled perma-bailout to the owners of financial assets. It’s no coincidence that asset prices have steadfastly risen in the last decade, as the Fed has embarked on a ludicrously unshackled period of money creation.</p><p>Many ask: against the backdrop of monetary issuance, where did the inflation go? It went of course into financial assets. But this benefits the paltry few. Did you know that the decade-long rally in the S&amp;P500 has been characterized by historically low participation from retail investors? The riotous gains in asset prices have sidelined mom and pop. They accrue instead to institutional investors and corporate insiders who returned capital to themselves through buybacks. In the 90s, Wharton MBAs convinced investors that the ideal mode of corporate governance was making large equity and options grants to corporate directors to create incentive alignment. Well, the grants were made, and the directors rewarded the shareholders by spending corporate earnings on buying back the stock, thus juicing earnings per share and triggering options payouts for directors. They just so happened to forgot to generate corporate value along the way. That pesky real economy… that was secondary.</p><p>Why are politicians so rich? Why do they become rich after leaving office? Why do regulators go work in industry? Why is the Secretary of the Treasury a former Goldman banker and hedge fund manager?</p>♦The Cantillon effect pictured<p>Why are renters historically disempowered, whereas landowners are historically privileged? Why has the cost of higher education and healthcare outpaced inflation by orders of magnitude? Why is the CPI a sad, pathetic joke? Do consumer goods account for most of your expenditures, or does rent, healthcare, and education?</p><p>What are you more exposed to? The cost of a TV, or property values?</p><p>Even if you didn’t know what the Cantillon effect was, you felt it vividly in the last decade. The hopelessness felt by many in today’s society is the consequence of this monetary misalignment; the introduction of eye-watering money into the economy, but an uneven distribution. Who benefited from historically low rates? Normal folks dealing with predatory credit card loans, or owners of financial assets who were able to put historically cheap capital to work? And no, cheap financing didn’t help the middle and lower class get a foothold in property… because property values were horrendously inflated in the first place! Property, treated as a store of value for the rich, is precisely where so many of the Fed’s newly-minted dollars settled. Reflect on those hollowed-out city centers in Vancouver, New York, and London — full of empty homes used as capital warehouses for absentee millionaires.</p><p>If there’s a single graph that evidences the impact of a decade of freewheeling monetary stimulus on the economy, it is the following:</p>♦<p>Monetary velocity in the U.S. is at its lowest since modern records began. If you think about the equation of exchange (MV = PQ), a decline in V is sufficient to offset an increasing money supply (M) to keep prices (P) stable. And that’s just about what happened: the purchasing power of the dollar has remained relatively stable even as supply has expanded dramatically. “Where is the inflation?” is the common refrain, but the question should instead be “where has the new money supply gone?” It is clear that it has settled, inert and unproductive, in financial assets mostly owned by the ultra-rich, bidding them up to century highs in relative valuation terms.</p><p>This is why our perverse form of zombie capitalism is often referred to as socialism for the rich. If you can position yourself close enough to the money spigot and arrange to share in the spoils of the monetary redistribution, you can profit handsomely. If you have access to financial assets and can benefit from a low cost of capital (whether you are an investor or a corporate director with discretion over buybacks), you can make low rates and quantitative easing work for you. If you cannot, you are utterly frozen out of the system, and indeed disadvantaged, as pricier capital assets immiserate the non rentier class.</p>Bitcoin is a system that explicitly rejects identity<p>Critics often ask who, exactly, Bitcoin is for. This perhaps a misspecified question. Bitcoin does not serve a “who,” or a subset of whos. It just serves, indifferent its end users. Bitcoin, by design, does not require identity data to work. Your counterparty could be on the OFAC sanctions list, they could be a sentient toad, or a few lines of code. Bitcoin has no way of knowing, nor does it care. The only requirement to send a payment is to provide a valid signature which meets the criteria sufficient to unencumber a UTXO.</p><p>Traditional payment and credit relationships, on the other hand, enshrine identity. My credit card company is very interested in knowing that it is me who is using the card. If I inform them that a stranger has absconded with my card, they consider all the spends post-theft totally invalid. The call with the fraud department goes like this:</p><ul><li>‘Can you vouch for the $10.51 purchase on 2/24 at Chipotle?’ Yes, that was me. Extra guac.</li><li>‘Can you vouch for the $463.39 purchase on 2/29 at Lululemon?’ No, I don’t habitually buy athleisure gear.</li></ul><p>Identity data is inextricable from traditional payment networks. This is because they are many layers between payments and final settlement. An incredibly large and profitable business exists to assess the credibility of transactors and facilitate deferred-settlement transactions between them. This is because credibility and mutual trust enables massive efficiencies. You can lend your neighbor a lawnmower without demanding he provide a bond to cover its value because you trust him. Credit card networks just scale this up: they are trust underwriters, determining quantitatively how trustworthy I am, and passing along those assurances to merchants with whom I transact.</p><p>If they get it wrong, and it turns out I’m the kind of person who racks up a $10,000 credit card bill with no intention of ever paying, they swallow the cost! It was their bad. They should have done a better job assessing my trustworthiness.</p><p>The compact you implicitly agree to when you use Bitcoin is between you and the protocol, not between you and all the other users of Bitcoin. The only trust required is users trusting that the cryptographic and economic assumptions hold. So far, they have.</p><p>It has become trendy to denounce popular Bitcoiners as uncompromising, unreasonable assholes, and imply that there is something wrong with Bitcoin as a consequence, too. But Bitcoin is indifferent to this. It is a protocol for encoding and conveying value through a communications medium. Bitcoin isn’t even aware of what the price of Bitcoin is, let alone the political trends of the day. It knows very, very little about itself.</p><p>As stated above, Bitcoin is attractive and useful precisely because it rejects any identity data from the conditions required for a spend. The only thing that has to be furnished is knowledge of a private key corresponding to a public key. When you receive Bitcoin, you do not need to be aware of the identity of the sender, because Bitcoin settles probabilistically. You can simply define your own threshold for finality — say, requiring $500,000 of work to be done before you consider a transaction final. That would correspond to waiting, at current rates, for 4–5 blocks under which your transaction should be buried.</p><p>This is what allows me to accept funds from people that I mistrust, and why Bitcoin is carving out a niche in these frontier transactions. Think of a ransomware hacker and his victim. These people mutually mistrust each other. They victim has been wounded and attacked. But the hacker still trusts that the $500 sent to them for the ransom in the form of BTC is a valid, unlikely-to-be-reversed payment. You may not like this. But Bitcoin flourishes on the margins of society. These are increasingly widening, as banking becomes politicized and used as a political tool, as the U.S.-driven settlement system is coopted for strategic objectives, and as identity requirements for payments networks become ever more rapacious.</p><p>Transacting with people you have no reason to trust is precisely why Bitcoin exists. The internet allowed us to transact with people on the other side of the globe, but internet commerce is beset by fraud. The reason credit cards are expensive is because the costs of remediating fraud and chargebacks are socialized.</p>If you aren’t comfortable with evil people using Bitcoin, you should abandon it now<p>Of course, the jettisoning of counterparty trust (and risk) comes with some perceived drawbacks. Principal among them, you cannot evict someone from your network. This is very uncomfortable to people who believe that money ought to be a political tool, to be exploited to disempower political foes of the day.</p>♦<p>There is a particular paradox in demanding that the members of a network you have inserted yourself into adhere to a certain moral code of conduct. As stated above, Bitcoin, and fast-settling hard money more generally, exists to facilitate commerce between individuals that do not have a pre-existing bond of trust. What did inter-continental traders use to transact in the 17th century? They certainly didn’t use IOUs, wampum, collectibles, or credit relationships. They knew that they might never see each other again, so they used the hardest money they had available — gold and silver. Monetary metals speak for themselves; they are no one’s liability.</p><p>In this same way, Bitcoin is a means to transfer wealth between individuals who both have an interest in final settlement. It is not a means to establish a credit relationship (although Lightning is an early move in this direction). Bitcoin is deliberately amoral, it has no requirements to entry and asks nothing of the user aside from a valid signature. It facilitates commerce between people who explicitly disagree with each other. Thus trying to impose a moral code on Bitcoin is contrary to its very nature. If everyone who used Bitcoin agreed with each other, then no one would need Bitcoin — they could all exchange IOUs backed by their mutual trust in each other. But because the world is messy, and people disagree with each other, hard money is warranted. Our chaotic world practically demands it.</p><p>So if you are the kind of person that rejects a useful transactional medium because someone you dislike is using it as well, it wasn’t suited for you in the first place. Bitcoin is edgy precisely because the world needs a payment and savings system which cannot be interfered with on moral or political grounds. To repudiate these transactional constraints is to violate the carefully poised moral setting that has seized the West. If stepping out of line isn’t for you, stick to Paypal instead.</p>Bitcoin is an apocalyptic death cult…<p>As Bitcoin hater-in-chief David Gerard so elegantly puts it, Bitcoin is in fact an apocalyptic death cult. Apocalyptic, because Bitcoiners recognize the futility of the current monetary system, and appreciate that it is likely to end in tears. Death, because States won’t give up their monetary privilege easily. Bitcoin is veiled in eschatological overtones. Cult, because you have to be somewhat deranged to take a pill this black.</p>♦Freedom is not “Free”.<p>So spare a thought for the Bitcoiners. They are fully awakened to the pending grief and strife that await us, Cassandras warning governments and citizens alike to the disruptive effects of truly sovereign currency (sovereign, as in free, not as in State-owned). But unable, most of the time, to convince their fellow man that the State’s monetary machinations may not be sound. Most people are content to surrender all freedom and autonomy to the Leviathan, as long as the pot they are in boils slowly.</p>… but it’s open to all<p>The exact reason that Bitcoin is despised by so many— identity, creditworthiness, and trust are irrelevant in this system, making it a fertile ground for criminals — is the exact reason why it’s so inclusive. Unlike Paypal, Venmo, or traditional payment processors, it cannot deplatform you for wrongthink, holding subversive political views, being a sex worker, or legally selling cannabis. Ours is the biggest possible tent. Don’t be distracted by the online discourse. Bitcoin is utterly indifferent to the political views of its users. Its core developers, the high priests of the protocol, can barely change it: (implementing a fairly routine upgrade, SegWit, took them years of cajoling and pleading). Getting it to do anything other than produce blocks, accept valid spends, resolve forks, and relentlessly march onward is virtually impossible.</p><p>Whether Bitcoin will challenge the State, or whether that task will be left up to a successor, is yet to be determined. That the State’s monetary privilege has been permanently eroded is evident though.</p><p>It died a little that day in January 2009 when the Chancellor [was] On the Brink, and it has been shrinking ever since.</p><p>By Nic Carter,<br>Oct, 2019</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below.

  medium.com/media/59cda701c33c68cabe2dc0848d2ffaec/href<p>People hate Bitcoin analogies. But Bitcoin is so hard to understand for so many, concessions need to be made.</p><p>VCs are a group of people demonized in the Bitcoin industry for not understanding Bitcoin’s value proposition. Well, how do you expect a VC to value Bitcoin if they’re only used to valuing startups?</p><p>Here is a framework that will hopefully help. It tracks the development and evolution of the Bitcoin ecosystem in discreet “fundraising rounds”, which coincide with Bitcoin’s Reward Eras. An organization is defined as “an organized group of people with a particular purpose”. If that’s the case, then Bitcoin is a well-oiled “un-organisation” with founders but no CEOs, many volunteers but no employees, and provably non-diluting equity, available to anyone who is willing to trade their energy for it.</p>♦Bitcoin As A Startup<p>I will be borrowing heavily from Nathan Reiff’s piece “Series A, B, C Funding: How It Works”</p>Pre-seed Round (1st Reward Era, 3/1/2009–28/11/2012)<blockquote>The earliest stage of funding a new company comes so early in the process that it is not generally included among rounds of funding at all. Known as “pre-seed” funding, this stage typically refers to the period in which a company’s founders are first getting their operations off the ground. The most common “pre-seed” funders are the founders themselves, as well as close friends, supporters, and family (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>The “Bitcoin Company” was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto, with its single product offering being an open-source monetary system project, known as Bitcoin. 2,100,000,000,000,000 shares were to be issued on a predetermined schedule, and anyone was free to buy or sell these shares. The founders initially held no initial equity, but equity was easy to build in those days, and rightly so. Just like any startup, it is the founding team and initial bootstrappers who should get the biggest rewards down the line for putting the most skin in the game.</p><p>Due to the nature of Bitcoin’s incentive mechanisms, many early “equity holders” were encouraged to use their time, skills and money to evangelise or develop the product, and hence increase the value of their equity. The company manages itself, in a zero-overhead environment.</p><p>During the first stage of “the company’s” life, traditionally the “the first bugs appeared and were ironed out, and this was an iterative process for many months. After proving to be robust and reliable, a market developed, and the first exchanges started to emerge. User experience, both from a software point of view, and a financial point of view, were a disaster. Bitcoin was virtually unusable without a PhD in Computer Science, and when you could use it, you’d be robbed by an exchange that had been “hacked”. Volatility was extreme, and the risk was unpalatable for the majority of onlookers. Whether or not “The Bitcoin Company” would remain “in business” was still a very dubious proposition.</p><p>This Era, the early equity holders were blessed with a parabolic bubble, and many divested some equity to give themselves runway to work on Bitcoin full time. It’s just like a fund-raise: get a big cash injection, and then burn it relentlessly until the next funding round. Coincidently, each round has exhibited at least one of these massive injections and equally massive drawn-out draw-downs.</p><p>During this Era, miners were rewarded with USD$13.5m in total block rewards and transaction fees. Assuming that, on average, cost to mine a bitcoin is equal to the market price, we can consider the mining reward to be miners buying bitcoin at-spot. Therefore, we can take the “money-in” for the round to be the cumulative miner’s revenue. Money-in is never consistent, and even a small injection is enough to make the price fly and form a bubble.</p><p>With all the above said, fortune favours the bold, and Bitcoin entered its seed round at a $1bn pre-money valuation (i.e. Bitcoin’s Market Cap was $1bn at the end of the first reward era).</p>Seed Round (2nd Reward Era, 28/11/2012–9/7/2016)<blockquote>You can think of the “seed” funding as part of an analogy for planting a tree. This early financial support is ideally the “seed” which will help to grow the business. Given enough revenue and a successful business strategy, as well as the perseverance and dedication of investors, the company will hopefully eventually grow into a “tree.” (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>Risk of short-term ecosystem death did not substantially decrease until the end of the Secord Reward Era. You could say that the risk profile dropped from “Extreme” to “Very High”. In terms of PR/Optics, this was arguably the worst and most dubious “round” of Bitcoin’s existence. In the face of these FUD-inspiring superficial problems, Bitcoin did what it does best — got on with it.</p><p>This era saw the first Bitcoin bubble to be featured in Mainstream Media in some way shape or form. Going from catastrophe to catastrophe; from the numerous exchange hacks, scams, asset seizures, 51% attacks (GHash.io) and China bans, those who invested in the mania of 2013 would not break even until the Third Reward Era. Inflation made things worse, with the market having to absorb the 5.25 million Bitcoin producing during the Era. However, those who divested during the mania provided themselves with many years of runway to give back to Bitcoin and make their equity more valuable.</p><p>In this Era, we started to see the emergence of user-friendly plug-and-play hardware wallets; the age of ASIC mining was in full swing, with miner fabrication done at a huge scale. The gamblers had a field day — with the majority of “fiat-onramps” providing toys for the traders, but not for the savers. For better or worse though, this added much needed liquidity and means for price-discovery. That said, liquidity was quite low, and for the first half of the era when the exchanges were just so sketchy, you couldn’t even really trust what the advertised market price was.</p><p>The first VCs entered the game; some investing in Bitcoin companies, and others, like Tim Draper, investing directly in the underlying.</p><p>Miners were not put off by the prolonged bear market, with the network hashrate growing by orders of magnitude mostly due to competition-driven innovation among ASIC fabricators. In the Second Reward Era, miners earned a total of USD$600m for their efforts. This USD$600m “investment” resulted in an $11bn post-money valuation at the end of the Round.</p><p>Despite failing to reclaim the heights of 2013, Bitcoin closed this round on the upswing — one that wouldn’t end for another year and a half.</p>Series A — Optimise (3rd (and Current) Reward Era, 9/7/2016 — May 2020)<blockquote>Once a business has developed a track record (an established user base, consistent revenue figures, or some other key performance indicator), that company may opt for Series A funding in order to further optimize its user base and product offerings. (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>With “traditional” startups, their Series A round is used to fund the optimization of the offering, and to lay a solid platform to build further during the next round. Several experts and industry stakeholders were split on how to best optimize Bitcoin to increase transaction throughput. The Establishment took the view that achieving this through an increase in block size was the answer, The People took the view that this was a slippery slope, and that scaling be achieved with protocol optimisations, i.e., Segregated Witness (SegWit). The People were victorious, which was a huge positive indicator that centralizing Bitcoin would be a Sisyphean task. As a result, and in combination with a supply halving, the money flowed in, and Bitcoin achieved a valuation in the hundreds of billions at its all-time-high.</p><p>The Third Era also featured “The Scambrian Explosion”, with thousands of cryptocurrencies being spawned, sending Bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency to a paltry 35% at one point in time. While most of these altcoins now having lost over 95% of their value (hundreds have lost &gt;99% of their value), the only result was the wasting of hundreds of thousands of hours of development time and hundreds of millions of dollars which should have been directed at Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin now accounts for 75% of the cryptocurrency market (and rising) is a testament to why people should have just stuck to Bitcoin.</p><p>The huge influx of money in this Era allowed early equity holders to further divest to focus on development — and my oh my, was there a lot of development. In terms of scalability, The Lightning Network successfully came out of beta and is being extensively used. Privacy and coin-joining solutions emerged and became easier to use. There are literal satellites in space broadcasting the network. The rise of the “run your own node” movement gathered serious momentum and was bolstered by a host of companies offering “plug-and-play” nodes. With your own node, you can also be your own payments provider through BTCPayServer. Multi-signature security has never been easier. This paragraph could go on for pages — so if you want a full technical recap of just 2019, the Bitcoin Optech Newsletter will give you everything you need to know.</p><p>At time of writing, Era miner revenue is USD$4.6bn, and the valuation has risen from $11bn to over $125bn.</p><p>Despite all the progress made, Bitcoin is still a high-to-very-high risk investment at this stage, as the market price can still move in excess of 30%, in either direction, in one week, regularly. This will ultimately remain the case until both the liquidity pool grows, and the mining reward (inflation) shrinks.</p>Series B — Build (4th Reward Era, May 2020 — Apr 2024)<blockquote>Series B rounds are all about taking businesses to the next level, past the development stage. Investors help startups get there by expanding market reach. Companies that have gone through seed and Series A funding rounds have already developed substantial user bases and have proven to investors that they are prepared for success on a larger scale. Series B funding is used to grow the company so that it can meet these levels of demand</blockquote><p>With the necessary protocol upgrades happening during Series A and early in Series B, the focus will shift to the building of products and services on top of the slowly ossifying Bitcoin base layer. This Era will see the replacement of the “Old Guard” by a newer generation of more business-savvy Bitcoin entrepreneurs and through merger and acquisition activity.</p><p>There will also be a lot of vertical and horizontal integration, as companies aim to achieve a “full-stack”. One example of all this is Layer1 mining, in what is effectively an electricity utility that also mines, and designs and fabricates ASIC miners.</p><p>It is impossible to predict what’s specifically going to happen during this 4 year era, let alone in the first year of it, but if the past 18 months are anything to go by, security, privacy, and most importantly going forward, UI/UX, will improve dramatically. I’d expect that running a full-sovereignty stack (your own VPN, node, electrum &amp; BTCPay servers, multi-sig setup, etc.) will be easy enough for almost anyone to do at the end of The Era. Effectively, Bitcoin’s infrastructure will be developed enough to handle some proper scale.</p><p>What will be most interesting thing to see will be the technological, economic and political developments during this Era. In this regard, everything is “Good for Bitcoin”. Internet access, computers and smartphones become cheaper and more accessible? This is good for Bitcoin. Never ending quantitative easing and negative interest rates? This is good for Bitcoin. Increased political turmoil, censorship, or surveillance? This is good for Bitcoin.</p><p>Should Bitcoin “stay in business”, risk level at this point would be medium-to-high, and you could expect to be exposed to weekly swings of +/-15%, but maybe not as regularly as in Series A.</p><p>When looked at in conjunction with some economic models like the Stock-to-Flow model, there is little reason to think a 10x growth in market cap will not be seen in this series, as per the 3 series preceding it. This would mean a series-end market cap of about USD$1 trillion, or, around USD$50k per bitcoin. Chances are that the All-time-high price achieved during this series will be dramatically higher than the end price, as this is the main driver of the “investment-to-utility” loop.</p>Series C — Scale (5th Reward Era, Apr 2024 — Mar 2028)<blockquote>Businesses that make it to Series C funding sessions are already quite successful. Series C funding is focused on scaling the company, growing as quickly and as successfully as possible. (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>Inflation is finally starting to drop, with only ~650,000 BTC needing to be absorbed by the market over the 4-year period — the inflation rate is now lower than that of Gold. Scarcity is becoming a more dominant element of Bitcoin’s value proposition.</p><p>With basically all the infrastructure largely built, and UI/UX continuing to improve, this Era is “The Era of The Evangelist”. Bitcoin is ready for prime time; somebody just has to go out and tell everybody. This Series’ fund raising round made all the right people very wealthy (if they weren’t already wealthy from the Series B raise), and these people will begin to use their influence (i.e. money) to promote Bitcoin, and increase the “saver-base”, i.e., the number of people who buy bitcoin on a weekly basis, or, earn their living in Bitcoin.</p><p>At this stage, to maintain a USD$500k price, about 10 million people are each saving USD$150/wk in Bitcoin. This represents 0.2% of the world’s adult population. Considering the level of utility and the seamlessness of the UI/UX in the late stages of this series, only 10 million active savers may even feel like a failure of sorts! From here, it is simply an exercise of marketing.</p>medium.com/media/da4a47f6535454fc2f34dc44828543b6/hrefIPO (6th Reward Era, Mar 2028 — Feb 2032), and beyond…<p>At this point, if Bitcoin is still alive, it is effectively unkillable. Major banks have now made big acquisitions, and are offering bitcoin services to their customers. Most power utilities have skin in the Bitcoin game. People won’t know that they’re using Bitcoin — and we’ll probably have 4 (or even 5) layers on top of Bitcoin now. On-chain base-layer transactions are reserved for high value transactions, all people adopting Bitcoin going forward won’t be onboarded via the base layer. The Bitcoin ETF has FINALLY been approved after an 18 year effort. Price per coin is in the millions, and fairly stable (to the downside, at least). Number still go up — just as designed.</p><p>It’s improper to say that it is “zero risk” in 2032, but the risk is extremely low. That said, if it gets to a 7th Era, I’d be comfortable enough to say that Bitcoin may become the first ever truly risk-free asset, with inflation rapidly approaching zero. I’ll be 50 years old by the end of Era 7, so I’m literally betting my career that this will be the case. Talk about skin in the game!</p>♦

  <p>Disclaimer: I have no current or future interest in a new cryptocurrency launch, either personally or professionally. This piece is intended generally as a thought experiment, and is NOT an endorsement of any specific project. I do not recommend or condone the creation of any new base-layer cryptocurrencies.</p>Foreword<p>The presence of ASICs in Proof of Work systems has always been deeply contentious. At maturity, ASICs enhance the security of the network (by forcing miners to take a long term stake in the success of the protocol), but in the transitional phase, the first hardware manufacturer to build ASICs has a near-monopoly on the minting of new coins. This can lead to the existence of an informal form of seigniorage — minting money at a discount to its market value. Protocols which fork frequently are also exposed to this risk; developers effectively have the ability to determine which PoW function the chain will move to, giving them the ability to monetize their influence over the protocol. This is a potentially very insidious form of corruption, and it impairs the ‘fairness’ quality that PoW is known for. GPU chains also have the undesirable quality of being ‘nicehash-able’ — that is, attackable by renting commodity hardware for a short period of time. There is no long-term bond required to mine a GPU coin, as the hardware is repurposable and salable.</p><p>Mindful of these issues, I started thinking last year about how an ASIC launch might work. Not because I have any interest in participating in one, but simply because I find it interesting to think about these tradeoffs. This culminated in this tweet:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>It&#39;s only a matter of time (&amp;lt;12 months) until we see a fair launch with an exotic PoW released by a dev team that has also made ASICs that work exclusively with that PoW. No details of the algorithm will be released until genesis block.</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@nic__carter</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>About a month later, Obelisk (a subsidiary of Nebulous) published their proposal for a commercial service, dubbed Launchpad, which could facilitate PoW launches with custom pre-built ASICs.</p><p>Introducing Obelisk Launchpad</p><p>I put my tweet in this article to demonstrate that I’ve been ruminating on these ideas for a long time, and I’m not writing this opportunistically to lend ‘moral support’ to any specific launch. I have had this piece mostly written for a long time, but I neglected it because I figured that PoW launches were essentially defunct and that there wouldn’t be a great deal of interest in them.</p><p>In fact, I was wrong about the timeline — no such launch that I am aware of occured in the 12-month period following the tweet. But it has come to my attention that a few teams are contemplating similar launches today. Thus I felt that my thoughts on this matter might be useful. Not for the benefit of any particular team, but because this gives us an interesting canvas to evaluate issues that are critical to the social scalability and security of these networks, whether it’s Bitcoin or other PoW chains.</p><p>If someone is intent on launching a new public blockchain, I firmly think non-premined PoW is the best way to do it, for a number of reasons, which I’ll get into later in the article. But I feel that GPU launches are increasingly more difficult and risky. I cannot stop anyone launching a chain. But I think a careful analysis of the tradeoffs might encourage teams to do things more responsibly, or, at the very least, explore other parts of the design space.</p><p>Lastly — some of you will be upset by my musings around how a new generic blockchain might be launched. If this is the case, I’d recommend simply closing the tab and disengaging. Additionally, while I think Bitcoin is likely sufficient as far as non-state monies go, I am also not willing to permanently rule out the potential emergence of some other PoW blockchain. I don’t see why we’d need another one now, but I find it hard to believe that Bitcoin is both the first and last viable blockchain ever to be created. I’m not afraid of competition, either. I think Bitcoin has its own unique merits, and smaller launches don’t compete with it or impair it in any way. Since it’s entirely possible to me that we do end up with another PoW chain at some point, it’s worth thinking about how to launch them.</p><p>Just so I’m absolutely clear on this: I’m not endorsing any specific launch or coin, or even new PoW launches generally. In fact, I would generally discourage anyone from launching a new blockchain. They tend to be boondoggles or ghost towns. But I am not ruling out the potential existence of a new blockchain at some point in the future.</p>Introduction<p>New cryptocurrency launches are beset by a strange paradox: they typically require a single, authoritative entity to spearhead development, to manage the process of launch, and coordinate development for a meaningful period throughout its infancy. Generally, a considerable amount of upfront investment in R&amp;D is required to create a differentiated protocol. All of these features tend to require the organizational and financial efforts of a single entity.</p><p>But of course the backing of a corporate entity (or the more subtle, let’s-pretend-there’s-no-organization-pulling-the-strings-here model) is a critical point of centralization. This means that adversaries have very obvious buttons to press if the protocol grows too big or disruptive; generally speaking, anyone hostile to the network will have an abundant ability to interfere with it. Additionally, these administrative entities often choose to retain not only a large fraction of supply, but also discretion over decision making, trademarks, and vetoes over future development directions. Much like Engels’ quote around the “withering state” as the end result of a socialist utopia, the claimed “path to decentralization” in monetary protocols is closer to rhetoric than reality.</p><p>To truly commit to surrendering power, the founders of these projects must be comfortable with austerity and eventual irrelevance. It’s sometimes said that Satoshi’s second most brilliant insight, behind creating Bitcoin, was leaving the project. Lamentably, virtually no cryptocurrency founders since have followed his lead, preferring filthy lucre and a shot at joining the Davos class, alongside their fellow central bankers.</p><p>Numerous models of protocol financing have been attempted over the years: the bitcointalk premine, the more sophisticated ICO, the founders reward, the covert premine and backdated whitepaper, the instamine, the merged fork. The purists will maintain that nothing other than a proof of work fair launch (ensuring no seigniorage, not even for the developers) is sufficient to confer the founding team with the legitimacy to create a worldwide protocol.</p><p>They have a point: it’s vanishingly unlikely that, if a meaningful portion of the world switches to a neutral cryptocurrency protocol, that future buyers of the coin would find it acceptable to enrich founders who allocated themselves 20% or more of this global currency for free. Seigniorage — more generally, the distinct feeling of unfairness, or being cheated — leaves a particularly nasty taste in one’s mouth. This, rather than any technical foibles, will be the doom of most of those sexy new high-TPS VC-backed base layer protocols. These aren’t startups: these are monies, competing on credibility, neutrality, institutional stability, and fairness. Private equity is concentrated and unfair, but you don’t need to use Uber stock to buy your daily bread. For something as essential as money, fairness is critical. A deeply unfair launch is an ugly miasma, lingering nastily, poisoning the authenticity of the project.</p><p>The singular appeal of a Proof of Work launch is not simply in the distributional advantage that at-home mining gets you (although this is a potent and underrated feature). No, the most important feature of the PoW fair launch is that it ensures that it is impossible to acquire coins for below market rate. You can purchase the coins on the market or with electricity; no one is entitled to an insider deal. Compare this to a dev team premining an ERC20 and then dripping it out on the market over a period of years. This looks cosmetically the same a PoW. But it’s not — because that team was able to acquire all the coins for $0. It would be similar to PoW if the dev team took the funds they received in exchange for the coins and set them on fire.</p><p>Of course, the disadvantage inherent in the ‘fair launch’ is the fact that it’s challenging to monetize the network, especially early on. This is fine if developers are happy to work idealistically or altruistically. In Bitcoin, patrons eventually emerged, as the network came to be systemically important. Today, a rich and diverse set of patrons subsidize dozens of core developers to keep the chain running smoothly and work on long term infrastructure. This is perhaps the ideal model; but Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first, the most critically important, and not having venture backers to reckon with. Today, any new cryptocurrency struggles to distinguish itself. Obtaining sufficient traction to survive on patronage or donations is a tall order. And as far as front-loaded R&amp;D goes, this is virtually impossible to finance without some sort of sale of future rights to protocol tokens. Many will point to the Grin case study here. Having made the somewhat anachronistic decision to aim for a proof of work fair launch targeted at GPUs, the Grin team struggled to monetize. Donations so far have been relatively scarce. A cautionary tale, to many.</p><p>Of course, those smugly deriding the weaknesses of the fair launch model tend to do so with the implicit intention of advertising straightforwardly exploitative launch models of their own. Let he who is without premine cast the first stone. Even though Grin has struggled for financing so far, its odds of becoming a significant monetary asset are not encumbered by securities laws issues, by the risk of the founder being arrested, or by the community becoming disenchanted as they are exploited by VCs dumping on them at the the first opportunity (For those who don’t believe me, read the fundraising decks of the crypto funds targeting token strategies. That language about low “time to liquidity” — that’s code for “we plan to exit our token positions at the public sale, because we want to secure a riskless return and dump this asset as soon as possible”).</p><p>The 2014–18 era ICO was, for the most part, a disastrous financial instrument. I have never come across a single one that I felt was issued responsibly to the public. Once these stopped being accessible to the general public, they lost their sole advantage: wide, permissionless distribution (note that this is a native feature of PoW). The issues with ICOs, especially those opting immediately for a proof of stake authority model (instead of a PoW bootstrapping, as Ethereum wisely opted for), are numerous:</p><ul><li>Insiders can purchase their own crowdsale, and covertly obtain an arbitrarily high fraction of supply for free (because they also get to collect the funds committed to the crowdsale)</li><li>Buyers can obtain tokens for arbitrarily low prices, since they are not created in a costly manner through proof of work, but summoned out of thin air. Thus, the private rounds that predate public sales often consist of pure seigniorage</li><li>Tokens often end up being a bizarre mishmash of an informal investment contract, and an arcade token for unlocking network resources. This causes speculation to crowd out usage and leads to very confused theories of value accrual</li><li>Tokens sold to the public (or done obliquely, a la Telegram) closely resemble investment contracts in most sensible jurisdictions, and this tends to make the issuers subject to securities laws, whether they like it or not</li><li>Issuers that retain a large fraction of supply tend to retain authority in the network, especially if a Proof of Stake model is opted for. This hampers the path to decentralizing authority, as issuers tend to resist divesting their share of the network</li><li>Early backers can obtain disproportionate shares of supply for essentially free, and then costlessly retain that advantage in perpetuity if the network follows a PoS model. This is a potent force which chills the dispersion of tokens, as stakers are not compelled to sell. In PoW, by contrast, miners must constantly spend and invest to retain proportional network authority. In PoS, retaining stake is simply the cost of running a server</li></ul><p>My central point is this: the principal challenge in the administration of a new monetary commodity is not a technical one. Of course, your blockchain must have compelling technical features. But ultimately the difficulty lies in climbing the wall of indifference. At inception, no one cares about your system. At maturity, you need tens and possibly hundreds of millions of individuals to care. If you give early investors discounted access to a significant fraction of supply, and then give them powerful anti-dilution rights (while hoping/expecting that future individuals will use your network as working capital and tolerate some dilution, in effect subsidizing the early buyers who passively stake), you risk creating a patently unfair system in which the winners are a function of the arbitrary prehistory of the chain.</p><p>Attracting anyone to a network like this strikes me as profoundly unlikely. Why your chain? Why not an equivalent fair launch, where every owner worked for their coins, instead of receiving an allocation through some proximity to the founding team?</p><p>But, ICOs, premines, and founder-tax coins have a crucial advantage: the ability to subsidize work on the protocol, even prior to its launch. Naively presuming that, in 2019, not all the cryptocurrency protocols that will ever exist have already been launched, one might go as far as to say that subsidizing work on a protocol prior to its launch might be a desirable property. So can one mix and match the desirable qualities of a coin launch while avoiding the worst of them? I certainly think so. Let’s review three popular models:</p>♦<p>Certainly more cons than pros in this case. In the U.S., selling rights to a cryptocurrency, especially to the general public, seems to be out of favor with our securities regulators. Not recommended. Additionally, giving early backers or big holders permanent, cheap-to-exercise anti-dilution rights dulls the dispersion of tokens, limiting its reach. We have fairly good data on this, thanks to the transparency that blockchains offer us. (I’d love to see a serious piece of work comparing the dispersion of ownership in PoS chains versus PoW chains. If you’re a researcher who is interested in taking this on, get in touch! I have data.)</p>♦<p>A classic. The Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and Grin model. A sensible approach, but difficult to bootstrap support, and reliant on community funding or patronage for ongoing support. Very effective and hard to kill if you can pull it off — but it requires a huge amount of community building to get traction. These appear to be getting less and less viable with time, especially as the financial stakes have grown. I’d expect that virtually all GPU launches today would be subject to the risk of insiders with prior knowledge of the algorithm covertly creating ASICs.</p>♦<p>This this hybrid model, pioneered by Zcash. This is essentially equivalent to a vested premine. It better aligns incentives than a pure premine, as the allocations are not unlocked for a number of years. Nevertheless, the proposal has issues of its own: in the case of Zcash, the protocol has been racked with controversy over whether the administrator should receive additional protocol-derived funding. The spigot of seigniorage is very hard to turn off, once active.</p><p>At this point, you might be wondering why I don’t simply agitate for vanilla PoW fair launches. By this rubric they seem plainly superior. But they aren’t without their issues. I think it’s worth being realistic about GPU PoW launches. Let’s look at a couple recent case studies.</p>Why GPU fair launches might be a thing of the past<p>As someone who followed the Grin launch rather closely, I must admit that it felt like a nostalgic last foray into a prior era. I got a decidedly Proustian pang from watching the process play out. As if I had dipped my madeleine in the tea and been transported back to the glory days of PoW launches from 2012–14.</p><p>The gossip going around about “$100m in VC-backed SPVs” was hyperbolic, but the launch certainly had problems. Initially hoping to stay ASIC-resistant in perpetuity, the developers ultimately opted for a pragmatic GPU-to-ASIC phased approach, envisioning a slow transition to an ASIC dominated network, but hoping for some more widely accessible GPU mining to begin with. There was a period of GPU mining, but some miners are now reporting to me that ASICs, or at least more efficient hardware (FPGAs), have begun to take a significant share of hashrate, somewhat ahead of the desired schedule. This isn’t exactly a failure, but it does illustrate the colossal difficulty inherent in the notion of ASIC resistance.</p><p>You are creating an enormous bounty for anyone to anticipate the PoW change, or to lobby the developers for a favorable outcome. The Grin developers did dither a little bit on the ultimate model for PoW (this was naturally a rather fraught discussion) and this ambiguity caused a lot of gnashing of teeth and lobbying efforts. It would have been far more efficient, overall, if resources had not been allocated to lobbying developers for a favorable hash function. Ultimately, the devs took extreme care to make the chain hostile to ASICs at inception, but they couldn’t stem the flow. They didn’t opt for ASICs right away due to a naive view that GPUs would dominate for the early history of Grin (and the difficulty coordinating this model with a distributed, non-corporate team), but ASICs (or at least FPGAs) appeared anyway.</p><p>Most ASIC resistant chains are beset by this same difficulty. They effectively create a massive bounty for teams to create FPGAs or ASICs and fly below the radar, hoping they aren’t discovered. Su Zhu says it well here:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>Every coin which is targeting GPU-mining is being stealth FPGA-mined at the very least, if not ASIC-mined already.

Let’s revisit what we’d like to optimize for:</p><ul><li>we’d like to limit seigniorage; that is, we want virtually every participant to have the ability to obtain the tokens at market price, with relatively few exceptions to this rule</li><li>we want the distribution period to be as long as possible</li><li>if being an early backer of the network does confer an advantage, it should be a temporary one and erode over time</li><li>a position of authority in the system should be costly to retain; it should not be costless to exert influence in perpetuity</li><li>being an early backer of the network should not grant you permanent anti-dilution rights</li><li>we want the system to work under existing securities laws in the U.S.: we want to disentangle the investment contract from the asset issued by the protocol</li><li>we want the network to be secure at inception (from a crypto-economic perspective)</li><li>we want the founding team to be able to meaningfully divest power and authority from the network; and</li><li>we want to inculcate a feeling of fairness and to minimize information asymmetries surrounding the network launch</li></ul><p>I believe virtually all of these qualities can be obtained in a model that has not been tried before:</p>The ASIC presale model<p>The basic idea is:</p><ol><li>Some developers create a new cryptocurrency protocol.</li><li>To finance this, they sell rights not to tokens, but to physical ASICs</li><li>Together with trusted supply chain partners, they manufacture these ASICs ahead of launch</li><li>These ASICs are sold to investors or, better yet, to the community of users who want to explicitly support the network in its early days.

As we learn more about the PoW security model, it’s clear that all but the largest GPU-mined networks are simply unsafe. Ethereum is probably an exception because it accounts for such a large fraction of the world’s GPUs, and they cannot be sold or rented in sufficient numbers. Aside from the structurally difficulty of acquiring sufficient hash power, this means that successfully attacking Ethereum would cause the value of GPUs worldwide to depreciate, which is a strong disincentive for any attacker. Aside from Ethereum though, most GPU mined coins are exposed to this risk of rented hardware being used to attack the chain, and we’ve seen copious examples of this. If you believe that dedicated hardware helps with security, then you will prefer the ASIC model. This approach gives you ironclad security from inception.</p>The investment contract-like element is firmly disentangled from the actual coins<p>In the case of an ICO, you have tokens which are presold to buyers. If these are understood to be investment contracts, or securities, this potentially compromises the entire supply of tokens, and inhibits their ability to circulate on exchanges. In an attempt to circumvent this, it has been argued that the investment contract covers only rights for future tokens, and that the tokens themselves are not the subjects of the investment contract. It’s under this reasoning that the ETH in the presale are understood to have likely been the subject of an investment contract, but the outstanding units of ETH at delivery of the blockchains were not themselves securities. I don’t really buy this distinction — at the very least, I find it tortured. I find it easier to simply distinguish the two.</p><p>In the case of the ASIC presale, you very clearly distinguish the investment contract from the coins themselves. If there’s anything which is security-like, it’s the ASIC sold to investors (although, as noted, it’s entirely possible that these aren’t even securities, as end users have to actually operate them and feed them with electricity, obviating the ‘efforts of third parties’ prong of Howey). The actual coins themselves are totally in the clear, in my opinion, since they are issued by the protocol in the manner of a conventional fair launch. I think we have copious evidence that fair launch tokens are not understood to be securities by the SEC. This gives potential users really convenient assurances that the trading of the asset won’t suddenly be restricted to security token trading venues. This is one of the greatest advantages of the model.</p>You get PoW distribution AND developers can finance themselves in a limited capacity<p>The distributional advantages of PoW have, to date, not been very well documented, but I have a strong intuition that they lead to better dispersion of supply. Relative to the vanilla PoW launch, developers can also finance R&amp;D and administrative costs involved in launching a new chain. And they’re not violating securities law. Sweet!</p>You get an arbitrarily long distribution period<p>Many have noticed that, as far as new monies are concerned, the existence of temporal contingency in distribution introduces an arbitrariness which limits the dispersion of the currency. In other words — short issuances (some ICOs were over in minutes) guarantee that the supply will be highly concentrated. Longer issuances give everyone a shot at obtaining the units of coins. This was part of the intuition behind the yearlong EOS ICO, which was a rather clever idea (aside from the fact that the crowdsale wallets had continuous outflows during that time, leading to conspiracies about recycling treasury funds back into the ICO). If you think about it, the EOS yearlong tokensale was somewhat akin to a PoW launch (with the exception being that the coins contributed to the crowdsale were not burned). Proof of Work gives you an extended permissionless distribution phase, although the decaying block reward means that new supply is much more abundant early on. Bitcoin’s issuance will last over 100 years, but over 80% of all Bitcoins have already been mined.</p><p>Comparing a PoW launch to a generic ICO, it’s very clear that permissionless access in a newly-launched ICO is impossible. Tezos straddled this transition, following a no-KYC crowdsale with a subsequent forced KYC process to unlock user Tezzies. I would imagine that all subsequent ICOs (to the extent that they do occur) will follow suit. The difference with PoW is that you are acquiring coins from a protocol. While ASIC suppliers might ask for KYC, generally speaking, mining is a much less permissioned environment than ICOs or crowdsales. Add in the reality that electricity is much more globally available than access to capital markets, and PoW looks very attractive. A protocol retailing off coins in exchange for electricity over a long period of time is an extremely potent means to issue an asset to a global audience. No one has devised a better way so far.</p>The rules of the game are very clear<p>One of the biggest issues with PoW chains in this day and age is ambiguity, especially around changing hash functions. When you have ambiguity, you have debate, and lobbying, and the possibility for developers to exploit their privileged status within the system. This is generally disastrous, and reduces social scalability, as well of the credibility of the system. If a small group of individuals if found to be abusing their protocol access to monetize, the system’s credibility is compromised. One alternative is to simply set the PoW function and commit to never changing it (this is essentially what Bitcoin has opted for, and why Bitcoin should never change its PoW unless something catastrophic occurs). That’s what this model calls for. No debate; no lobbying; no covert exploitation.</p>The initial advantage depreciates over time, providing the system with natural dispersion<p>Unlike something like a PoS token sold in a presale, the initial balance of power in the ASIC launch system changes dramatically over time. Initially, a select few have near-monopoly rights on supply. But this is a temporally limited advantage, and the appearance of new ASICs, or even simply the passage of time, and the depreciation that that brings, erodes that initial advantage. I want to emphasise that I consider this a good feature. Too much power granted to the early stakeholders in the network — plus the ability to retain this power, costlessly, in perpetuity, is a dysgenic feature. This massively inhibits the dispersion of the holder base. The presence of PoW is useful here. It induces constant selling on the part of miners, reducing their protocol-proximate privilege. The same cannot be said for staking. While in the case of the ASIC launch we have a privileged few early on, their advantage rapidly depreciates.</p><p>Let’s unite everything in a big chart, to compare how the alternative launch methods deal with various downsides.</p>♦<p>While I think this is an interesting and attractive model for a new launch, there are certainly some open questions still, especially as we’ve never seen it done in the wild. These are some of mine:</p><ul><li>is it possible to extract a margin on ASICs sufficient to render this a profitable enterprise?</li><li>what is the shape of the supply curve such that the temporary monopoly on supply would be considered acceptable to future users?</li><li>how can ASIC buyers have confidence that no additional ASICs were covertly created?</li><li>can one-shot financing be sufficient to bootstrap a business building an open source protocol?</li><li>is the limited amount of seigniorage disqualifying in terms of creating a monetary asset?</li><li>are the ASICs themselves investment contracts/securities, or are they in the clear?</li><li>is it possible to build an ASIC supply chain that doesn’t concentrate with one or two entities having unilateral control over the hardware production process?</li></ul><p>What do you think? Worth trying or a pointless waste of time? I’m curious to hear your thoughts. I feel that launch methods are generally under-covered, so I hope that this post kicks off some discussion, regardless of whether this model is considered viable.</p>Objections<p>I will consider a few objections here.</p>If you applied this model to Bitcoin, six months of mining would represent 1.3m BTC, which is an excessively large fraction of supply<p>You can tune the shape of the supply curve however you like, to give the monopolists in those first 4–6 months an arbitrary fraction of supply. You could design the curve such that they get 0.1% of supply or 99.5% of supply. I think an issuer would probably aim to target something like 5–10% of supply for that initial period, but that’s a totally wild guess.</p>Why do you expect that the initial batch of ASICs will last 4–6 months? Why wouldn’t they last essentially forever and give ASIC buyers a permanent advantage?<p>If the protocol actually ends up being relatively significant, market cap-wise, then ASIC manufacturers will inevitably jump in and make ASICs for it. From conversations with ASIC manufacturers that I know, the shortest period it takes to make a useful ASIC for a new cryptocurrency algorithm is about four months, although I would happily take expert input here. FPGAs in this example wouldn’t suffice, because the existence of ASICs at inception means there’s a relatively high bar to clear in terms of competitive hardware. Either way, the point remains — I fully expect that the first miners would be met with competition within six months at the latest.</p>The ASICs in this example actually aren’t securities<p>This isn’t exactly an objection but I wanted to address it anyway. I’ll admit I don’t know the answer here. You definitely have to mix the ASICs with your own labor (and electricity) to get a return, so their value doesn’t purely derive from the efforts of a third party. I am just vaguely guessing that the ASICs might resemble an investment contract. I am not a lawyer. This isn’t legal advice. Either way, if they weren’t securities, that would be even better for the model. We’re trying to avoid violating securities law, remember.</p>The issuers are giving ASIC manufacturers total power. They could create extra ASICs and cheat the process<p>This is definitely a risk, so the ASIC manufacturers must be contractually bound or closely trusted by the issuing team. The risk is that they covertly create too many ASICs. There are potential ways of mitigating this. I haven’t put a lot of thought into it, but I feel like the team could set up a protocol similar to google authenticator where they give miners ciphertext to include in coinbase outputs for the first few months, to ensure that the blocks being mined are being created only by ASICs which are accounted for. I’m not sure. I think someone clever could come up with a better way to ensure that only members of a permissioned set of ASICs is permitted to mine for the period in which they have a temporary monopoly.</p>We don’t need any more blockchains. Stop helping people figure out how to issue new cryptocurrencies<p>I basically agree, but I’m not going to stop exploring these issues just because you don’t like the idea of new coins existing. We may well discover a reason to create another blockchain at some point. Who knows.</p>This launch is actually quite unfair, as you’re suggesting creating a premine<p>Definitionally, this isn’t a premine. There is no “prior mine”. (I’ll admit that quibbling over definitions misses the point). What we have are the issuers monetizing their informational advantage. They know what hash function will be used, and they are selling that information in the form of purpose-built hardware. The mining is up to whoever the ASICs are sold to. They do get a temporary monopoly. Think of it like a taxi medallion which decomposes after six months. It’s clearly unfair. But having observed the Grin launch, and the ProgPoW debate, and the many Monero and Vertcoin “ASIC-resistance” hard forks, it’s very clear to me that developers are extremely susceptible to lobbying over PoW. I would prefer that the hash function is never changed, so that the rules of the game are fixed and the returns to lobbying are 0.</p><p>So in this case we have a transparently unfair model, as contrasted with a (potential) covertly unfair situation which people naively think is fair. The latter would be disastrous. Imagine a chain which was ASIC resistant, forked to a new PoW, for which it later emerged that the developers had custom-designed hardware, while everyone else mined with GPUs. This would constitute an exploitation of the community, and a breach of trust. This is entirely possible within the framework of ASIC-resistant coins, and I expect it to happen at some point. I’m proposing a situation with temporally limited unfairness, which decomposes over time, and becomes pretty explicitly fair thereafter.</p>Developers shouldn’t monetize. They should work on these things altruistically. Otherwise you cannibalize intrinsic motivation<p>I pretty much agree! I think that one of the most perverse outcomes with protocol-funded rewards is that FOSS developers lose their incentive to contribute to the protocol, leaving it all to the professionals who are paid directly from that protocol-funded spigot. This essentially turns a FOSS project into a corporate one, obviating all the advantages of using FOSS in the first place.</p><p>This specific configuration is a very limited monetization. The developers sell ASICs at the price that the market will tolerate, and that’s the only chance they have to directly monetize their protocol access. Later on, they can think about adopting the Red Hat/ COSS / Blockstream model, where they monetize their protocol-specific expertise. But this model also empowers the initial issuers/developers to exit the project without destroying it. Because they do not have permanent authority in the network, as would be the case with an issuing team retaining a large fraction of PoS tokens, for instance.</p>Developers can’t sufficiently monetize under this configuration<p>Excessive developer monetization of a monetary protocol they develop is a very dangerous thing, in my opinion. At a certain threshold you have an operation which is primarily dedicated to extracting rent, rather than delivering computational services at commodity prices. Anything developers to do abuse their authority in the system — including extracting value in excess of the minimum required (which may well be 0) — undermines its credibility and raises the likelihood of users leaving for a less extractive system. I am generally of the belief that no protocol-funded monetization whatsoever is optimal. But if there is to be some, I would tolerate it under the conditions that it is temporary, limited, and does not give the developers permanent authority within the system. This meets those restrictions.</p>It’s too expensive to launch in this manner. Issuers won’t be able to sufficiently finance themselves<p>This is a fair critique. Instead of creating the tokens for ~free and selling them, developers have to literally create hardware and sell it. ASICs are generally quite expensive. I suppose it might vary on the type, but a decent run will cost millions of dollars. So the issuers will need to be able to charge a sufficiently high price to extract a margin. This has the interesting effect of “pricing” the offering.</p><p>If the ASICs are expected to have a monopoly on issuance in the first six months, and 10 percent of supply will be issued in that period, the value of the fully diluted supply will roughly be 10 times what buyers pay for the ASICs. This establishes a floor for the required valuation of a project for issuers to be able to monetize in this manner. Let’s say it costs $5m to create a run of 1000 ASICs (it may well be much more — I don’t know much about hardware). Developers need to collect a decent chunk to finance R&amp;D, let’s say another $5m. So they need to be able to retail the ASICs for $10m collectively, or $10,000 each. Let’s also say they decide to issue 10% of supply in the first 6 months and they think the ASICs will hold up for that period. This means that the chain has to be priced by the market at a $100m valuation in the aggregate (at the time of the ASIC sale) for the issuers to collect sufficient margins.</p>Why go through all this trouble to launch in this convoluted way? Why not just do an ICO and retain a treasury for long term incentive alignment?<p>First of all, ICOs appear to be a violation of securities law in virtually every sensible jurisdiction. Going “offshore” probably won’t be enough, as many issuers will likely discover in 2020. This post is a proposal for an alternative to the PoW ‘fair’ launch, and the claim is that it improves along a couple directions. It’s not an alternative to ICOs. I believe that in today’s day and age (really anytime post the SEC DAO Report (released July 2017)), ICOs are largely unworkable from a regulatory perspective. Additionally, I think the ICO launch method will have a very hard time creating lasting monies.</p><p>This is still a hypothesis, but I strongly feel that the most important trait of a novel monetary system is a widely dispersed ownership. It starts with a GINI of 1 and its objective is to get to a reasonable level of dispersion with time. Now I don’t mean perfect equality of outcome — such a thing is impossible, and it’s unclear how that would even work. Every adult in 2019 receiving an equal entitlement to a share of the new monetary system? What about future humans? Unborn children? Even if mechanically possible, a global UBI would still be exposed to immense temporal contingency — privileging the interests of people today.</p><p>Airdrops don’t appear to work very well. Stellar’s attempt to distribute their coins as widely as possible has been a truly dismal failure. Something received for free tends not to be valued by the recipient. No surprise. Proof of Work is a potentially superior system. Miners must work for their share. They must commit time and effort to mining. This distribution method is truly underappreciated. If Ethereum succeeds, it will be in large part because it was mineable for 5+ years on commodity GPUs. Delaying the switch to PoS (which I argue above dulls the dispersion of coins) was a saving grace, in my opinion. As stated, this is still just an intuition. But I feel that PoW’s distributional qualities are very underrated. Many of these closely held monetary protocols will face the sisyphean task of getting users to store value in their currency.</p>ASIC manufacturing is a concentrated industry where foundry allocations and political connections determine the winners. You are ensuring the ASIC manufacturers will be kingmakers here<p>It’s true that cryptocurrency ASIC manufacturing is currently rather oligopolistic. For a rather eye-opening take on how the industry operates from a U.S. based ASIC manufacturer, read David Vorick’s take here. What’s interesting about the ASIC launch is that is actually strips power from the big manufacturers like Bitmain, and restores it to the issuers of the coin. A fair GPU launch just sets of an arms race among the big ASIC manufacturers over who can build ASICs fastest. When they get there, they intensely lobby the team to not change the algo (see the ProgPoW debate in Ethereum).</p><p>In this situation, the team works with an ASIC manufacturer of their choice to create ASICs for launch, and ASIC manufacturers then have the opportunity to make chain-specific hardware subsequently. What is very clear is that the early returns to mining will not accrue to the big ASIC manufacturers. If they exist, they will accrue to the community members who purchased the ASICs from the issuers. This is overall a significant improvement. I’ll add that there’s an awkward transition that virtually every ASIC resistant chain has to and will make as they eventually capitulate and embrace ASICs. Choosing to trumpet ASIC resistance, coordinating a couple hard forks, and eventually accepting the inevitability of ASICs is to create a huge amount of ambiguity that ASIC manufacturers can and do exploit. I much prefer a game where the rules are explicit from day 0.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the possibility to create ASICs which aren’t as exposed to supply chain idiosyncrasies that SHA-256 ASICs currently require. The kingmakers for Bitcoin ASICs are the foundries, which privilege the big ASIC manufacturers who can pre-pay for access and compete for allocations. Some alternative technologies like optical Proof of Work purport to inculcate a fairer ASIC manufacturing processes. I haven’t independently verified this, but this is the claim. If so, ASICs of that sort would be easier to mass-produce in a greater variety of settings.</p>Any amount of seigniorage is disqualifying<p>I am not entirely sure that I would call this seigniorage, as it’s entirely possible that ASIC buyers lose money and end up effectively paying $1.10 for each dollar that they mint. It’s not guaranteed seigniorage, at least. ASIC buyers are taking on a degree of risk. That said, if the model works well, ASIC buyers will be minting coins below market rate — if there wasn’t the possibility of doing that, they wouldn’t participate. So there is potential seigniorage. If you feel that even the slightest amount of seigniorage permanently ruins the credibility of the project, this model won’t work for you. But if you feel, as I do, that a small amount of seigniorage can be very useful, even if it trades off against credibility, you might find this model attractive.</p>Why are you wasting your time thinking about this? We already have Bitcoin and we don’t need any new chains<p>I reserve the right to think and write about whatever I find interesting!</p>♦

  <p>Bitcoin works. No matter what other opinions you hold about this strange
phenomenon, it undoubtedly works, marches on, or, as I (and others) have
previously argued, is alive. Even if most of the world would
grind to a halt, the Bitcoin network would continue to produce valid blocks
every 10 minutes or so.</p>

<p>Bitcoin works because of many things: game theory, economic incentives,
cryptography, ingenious engineering, resilience on a network level, and
so on and so forth. Killing Bitcoin is hard. Really hard. Killing
Bitcoin is like killing an idea. An idea that is stuck in the heads of
hundreds of thousands of zealous individuals.</p>

<p>First of all, it is quite hard to shut down the internet globally; and
secondly, Bitcoin can transcend the internet. Everything which can
transmit data can be used to transmit bitcoin transactions, and
everything which can hold data can store a copy of Bitcoin’s block
chain. It’s just a ledger; the whole thing is just information.</p>

<p>Curiously, the Bitcoin network is embodying the eternal struggle of
life: the struggle against entropy; a battle on the edge between order
and chaos.</p>

<p>To understand this chaotic struggle — and how Bitcoin thrives because
of it — it is helpful to briefly discuss the following concepts:
entropy, randomness, and information. I hope to convince you that these
concepts are related and that they are essential in Bitcoin’s ongoing
struggle for survival.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>



Entropy

<p>In computing, entropy can be used to measure the randomness of a data source. In
cryptography in general, and in Bitcoin in particular, a good source of entropy
is essential to keep you secure. Mess up the entropy of your private key (aka
your seed phrase) and your bitcoins will be my bitcoins soon.</p>

<p>Note: the technical term for this unwanted transfer of coins is rekt. You
don’t need to know what “getting rekt” means in detail, or the many ways in
which you can get rekt; it is enough to know that you should avoid such a
situation at all costs.</p>

<p>Entropy is quite a complicated concept, but in general terms, it
describes how random or how compressible something is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>High entropy: randomness.</li>
  <li>Low entropy: orderliness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, in other words, with a nod to Tsachy Weissman:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High entropy: not very compressible.</li>
  <li>Low entropy: very compressible.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are complicated formulas and quite a few disambiguous definitions of
entropy. The concept finds applications in classical thermodynamics, statistical
thermodynamics, quantum statistical physics, order and disorder, life,
astrophysics, and more. It is also a measure of irreversibility.</p>

<p>In Bitcoin, reversibility and irreversibility are probabilistic. If enough
people with enough hash power collude transactions could be reversed. Absolute
irreversibility does not exist in Bitcoin. Final settlement is never final, but
always probabilistic. Yes, the chances of reversal might be beyond astronomical,
but nevertheless, final settlement does not and should not exist in Bitcoin.
Nakamoto consensus forbids it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of
Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed in an isolated system. The second law states that the
entropy of any isolated system always increases, and the third law
states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the
temperature approaches absolute zero.”</p>

  <p><cite>Knut Svanholm</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Bitcoin, entropy is important for multiple reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Secret information should be generated by high-entropy data sources</li>
  <li>New blocks reverse entropy locally, i.e. create order out of chaos</li>
  <li>Bitcoin’s security model relies upon chaotic processes</li>
  <li>Validation relies on deterministic processes</li>
  <li>Everyone can validate structured data</li>
  <li>Nobody can guess random data</li>
</ol>

<p>While the above speaks in absolutes (everyone and nobody), the truth
is more nuanced: Again, Bitcoin is probabilistic in nature, thus, in
theory, one could guess a private key just like in theory you could
find a billion valid blocks in one millisecond.</p>

<p>Details aside, we will try to keep it simple here. In general, if you
have two coins, the entropy of this system is two. As in: you can
describe the whole system with two bits: 00, 01, 10, 11.</p>



  ♦


  2 bits of entropy



<p>Flip both coins at the same time, and you will end up with either
tail-tail, tail-heads, heads-tail, or heads-heads. If you are a fair coin
flipper, the chance of each combination will be 25%. Imagine a system
that flips hundreds of coins at once, and you have something which could
be used to generate a private key.</p>



Randomness

<p>Randomness is essential to cryptography. At the root of all secret
communication is some form of information asymmetry: you know something
a potential eavesdropper does not.</p>

<p>A good secret is like a good password: randomly generated, i.e. coming
from a data source that has a high degree of entropy.</p>



  ♦


  Random noise. How much information is contained in this image?



<p>If something is “perfectly” encrypted, an eavesdropper can not
distinguish what was said from random data. This is the purpose of
proper encryption: you want to hide what was said, and, if possible,
even hide the fact that something meaningful was said at all.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Good” randomness: not compressible / high entropy / secret /
secure.</li>
  <li>“Bad” randomness: compressible / low entropy / guessable /
insecure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin doesn’t use encryption per se. The ledger is public and
transparent by design, enabling anyone to audit the whole system with
the will to do so. Bitcoin uses cryptographic signatures and
cryptographic hashes, both of which produce quasi-random outcomes. And
if you know the secret, you can unlock some coins (using your private
key), add new blocks to the block chain (using the nonce you found), or
prove that you are who you say you are (by signing a message, which at
least proves that you are in control of one or multiple keys).</p>

<p>Only you know your private key. Nobody else should know your private
key. Only you, the successful miner, found the nonce for the next block.
That is information asymmetry. That is what makes Bitcoin work.</p>

<p>All cryptographic systems work because of information asymmetry. And
curiously, properly encrypted data is indistinguishable from random
data. Otherwise, an eavesdropper could make some sense of the
encrypted message, which in turn would mean that the encryption used
isn’t very good.</p>



Information

<p>What is information, anyway?</p>

<p>People often say that Bitcoin is thermodynamically secured. While this
is true, I’d like to dig a little deeper. What does thermodynamically
secured mean, exactly?</p>

<p>It means that — as far as we know —changing things in our universe
requires energy. When I say “changing things” I mean it: change anything
at all in our universe, and you will need to “use” energy — put in
some work — to change that thing.</p>

<p>Move a chair? You have to put in some work. Grow a tree? You’ll need the
energy of the sun to turn CO2 into wood. Do a calculation? Energy is
required to manipulate whatever is holding the data. Store the outcome?
You’ll need energy to arrange (and protect) the atoms for storage, no
matter what medium is used.</p>

<p>Bitcoin lives mostly in the informational realm, and just like all other
information systems, it needs to store and process the information via a
physical medium. Thus, if you change information in Bitcoin, you
effectively change a thing in the real world. Whether that thing is a
solid-state disk, USB stick, hard drive, optical storage medium, or
something else doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>The fact that changing things — or, in other words: flipping
bits — requires energy, is
the root conundrum of all computation. It is the reason why your
computer makes a bunch of noise and gets hot if it does a lot of
“thinking.” It is the reason that computer science students have to
study the Big O notation and software companies love to ask questions
about it. Changing a zero into a one requires work, and no matter how
fast you are working, you still need to expend some amount of energy.
According to physics, there literally is no such thing as a free lunch.
Flipping bits is work, which requires energy.</p>

<p>And here is the thing: Bitcoin utilizes the fact that the difference
between hard computational problems and exponentially hard
computational problems is big. Mind-bogglingly big.</p>

<p>Alright. Back to our original question: What is information, anyway?</p>



  ♦


  Sorted colors. How much information is contained in this image?



<p>Information relates to both knowledge and meaning. It is the
opposite of not knowing, and the opposite of information in data is
randomness. In other words: if you are not able to make sense of some
data, it might appear random to you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sensible information: quite compressible.</li>
  <li>Nonsense information: not very compressible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pi might help to clear up what I’m trying to say: 3.141592653589793…
can be “compressed” into π, or the circumference of a circle with the
diameter of one.</p>

<p>As a computer programmer, you could think of this concept as follows:
can I write a computer program that generates the information I’m trying
to convey, which is actually shorter than the information itself?
(That’s what I mean when I say “compressible”.)</p>

<p>In short: sense and nonsense, order and chaos, or information and
randomness are intricately linked. One could say that they are two
sides of the same coin, and both concepts are related via something we
call entropy.</p>

<p>Information implies structure and structure benefits from redundancy.
The most ancient structures in nature have been adapted for survival by
evolution. At the root of it is DNA, two chains that coil around each
other to form a double helix. Symmetric, redundant information. The
properties which allow DNA to survive and thrive are embedded in its
processes: redundant structure, a copying mechanism that relies on this
structure, the baked-in error correction which leads to four bases
instead of two, etc.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, in comparison, is simpler: one chain, two bits, no error
correction (information is copied perfectly). However, as with DNA, the
properties which allow Bitcoin to survive (and thrive) are embedded in
the replication process: a chaotic race to find new blocks, replication
of blocks in the network, and replication of the software (and the
ledger) on as many nodes as possible. Further, when we talk about the
Bitcoin organism, error correction is equivalent to being alive. The
network self-validates with every beat of the heart, every ten minutes
or so. This is what makes the bitcoin organism extremely robust as well.
It is designed for survival.</p>

<p>In Bitcoin, high entropy information is usually kept secret. Your
private key should, as the name implies, be kept private. It is for
your eyes only. Which particular nonce you just tried, i.e. the work
you already did when mining a new block, is usually kept private as
well. You don’t want your competitors to know which numbers produce
invalid blocks and can be skipped.</p>



  ♦


  Chaos on the left, Order on the right.



<p>Bitcoin utilizes both order and chaos to create a system that grows
— and even thrives — between these extremes. It utilizes information
asymmetry and an ingenious incentive structure which leads to a global
competition to find Bitcoin’s secrets.</p>

<p>Which processes are orderly, which are chaotic, and how Bitcoin is able
to grow on the edge between order and chaos will be explored in the next
section.</p>



Growth between Order and Chaos

<p>What makes the Bitcoin network tick? Again, there might be many answers
to this question, but the only thing that is truly ticking in the
Bitcoin network is the global clock: a block clock, where every block
is one unit of time.</p>

<p>Currently, we call this process mining because new bitcoins are
generated for every valid block that is mined (read: found). We call
this the block subsidy, and it is an incentive structure to bootstrap
the network.</p>

<p>In a sense, the Bitcoin organism “grows” on the edge between order and
chaos: finding new blocks is a chaotic process, and its result is a very
orderly list of transactions: the Bitcoin block chain, also known as
the ledger.</p>

<p>From a “finding new blocks” point of view, we are still extremely early.
Only ~10 years in. The block reward era will go on until the year 2140
or so, which means we are about 13% into the bootstrapping phase of
Bitcoin: the reward era.</p>

<p>Satoshi undoubtedly knew that this was a long game. The era where fresh
blocks are associated with a reward is only one phase of the Bitcoin
game. Note that this phase is 6930000 blocks long. With an average block
time of ~10 minutes, the reward era turns out to be 131 years long.</p>



  ♦


  2019: Early days of the Bitcoin Reward Era



<p>There will be a time where those who are tasked with finding new blocks
are rewarded mostly via the networks’ fee market, as Dan Held
brilliantly argued in Bitcoin’s Security is
Fine. The
point in time where the fee market takes over will be somewhere between
the year 2020 and 2140. Either that, or Bitcoin will die, or some museum
computers will try to find new blocks at an economic loss.</p>

<p>After this point in time, we will probably still talk about “mining”
bitcoin, even though all the “miners” won’t be producing any new
bitcoins. All 21 million BTC — or 2,099,999,997,690,000 sats, to be
precise — will have been mined. No new bitcoin will be added to the
pool of existing coins in circulation.</p>

<p>Miners — if we still call them that —will still try to find new
blocks, mind you. But the bitcoin moved by these blocks will have a long
economic history. Gone are the days where miners award themselves new
bitcoin in the coinbase transaction, to be spent after 100 blocks.</p>

<p>Will bitcoin still exist in 5000 years, and eventually beat gold as the
de-facto money of humanity? I don’t know, but important information is
extremely hard to kill. I expect bitcoin to live for a very long time,
just like ancient scriptures and religious texts survive to this day. It
is just information, all of it, and it can transcend the medium it is
printed on.</p>

<p>Of course, I expect something approximating
hyperbitcoinization
to have happened until this point. We will have a circular bitcoin
economy, and bitcoin banks will globally settle vast amounts of value
between them. What private citizens — or sovereign individuals, to use
a more fitting term — will use is yet to be seen. I doubt that the
bitcoin base layer will be used by persons like you and me. And that’s
perfectly fine.</p>

<p>With the stage set, and concepts like order, information, randomness,
and entropy in mind, let’s take a look at some bitcoin concepts. We will
distinguish them visually: from chaotic (left) to orderly (right).</p>



  ♦


  Bitcoin grows between order and chaos.



<p>While the framing of order and chaos is useful, it is neither precise
nor universally applicable. However, I believe that thinking about the
parts which make Bitcoin tick in this way is a helpful exercise, and I
believe that the core point — that bitcoin lives, grows, and thrives
on the edge between order and chaos — is profoundly true.</p>



  ♦




<p>Let’s ponder on these concepts for a bit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Private key: Chaotic information, very high randomness. Secret
information which is best kept private. Maximum entropy for maximum
security. If your private key is not random, you’re gonna have a bad time.</li>
  <li>Nonce: Chaotic information, high randomness. A nonce is a specific
number. Miners are in constant competition to find the next nonce which
produces a valid block. Multiple numbers might fit the criteria, but the
mining process is very much like finding one random number.</li>
  <li>Fresh block (before broadcast): Newly found blocks are the outcome of
the chaotic process which is finding a nonce. Before blocks are broadcast,
blocks can be understood as secret information. Fresh blocks can be
ambiguous, since multiple blocks can form a valid chain tip at the same
time. It is in your best interest to broadcast a fresh block immediately to
everyone to reap the reward. Fresh blocks are only held back if you are an
attacker, or very stupid, or both.</li>
  <li>Chain tip: Forming the chain tip is a process which is mostly orderly,
but again, it is generated by a chaotic process. As mentioned above, the
chain tip can be ambiguous. One version of the chain tip will survive, the
losing versions will become orphan blocks. You can validate the correctness
of all information in all blocks up to the chain tip. The chain tip reflects
the current time in Bitcoin.</li>
  <li>Orphan blocks: Orphan blocks are part of the orderly, natural growth
process of the Bitcoin block chain. Valid blocks are discarded on a regular
basis. If two valid blocks are found at roughly the same time, they fight a
probabilistic battle for survival. In the long run, only one block can win
this race. The losing block will become an orphan block and die a lonely
death.</li>
  <li>Unconfirmed transactions: Orderly structure which can be easily
validated. An unconfirmed transaction can be valid or invalid. Valid
transactions are included in blocks based on economic incentives, which is
— again — a probabilistic, market-driven process. Invalid transactions
are discarded.</li>
  <li>Buried blocks: Orderly structure generated by a chaotic process, some
time ago. The possibility of a reorg (re-organization of buried blocks)
becomes exponentially unlikely because the probabilities against it
multiply. Example: if every block has a 50% chance to reorg, the chance of a
6 block reorg would be 1.5%. Actual numbers are closer to 0.31% per block
and 0.0000000000008875% for a 6 block reorg.</li>
  <li>Confirmed transactions: Orderly structure which can be validated very
easily. Irreversibility is probabilistic and dependent on block height. Once
a transaction is confirmed, it becomes more final the deeper it is buried in
the block chain.</li>
  <li>Public keys: extended public keys (xpub, ypub, zpub) are generated by a</li>
  <li>deterministic process from a random seed — your private key.</li>
  <li>Block time: Valid blocks are found, on average, every 10 minutes. This
is what makes the Bitcoin network tick. Bitcoin’s heartbeat is extremely
regular when measured in blocks. While still regular when measured in human
time, mining is a fundamentally probabilistic process, and thus there is a
real possibility that some blocks are found very quickly or comparably late.</li>
  <li>Difficulty adjustment: While the difficulty adjustment is a very orderly
process, it can be a bit chaotic if hash power changes drastically (as it
did in August 2017, because of the contentious bcash hard fork). Difficulty
adjustment is based on block time, which is only probabilistically linked to
human time.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin supply: Bitcoin’s supply is fixed since its inception. The
issuance of new bitcoin is embedded in Bitcoin’s consensus code and is thus
virtually impossible to change.</li>
  <li>Whole ledger, deeply buried blocks (aka the Bitcoin block chain):
Orderly, sequential, structure which is pretty much unambiguous up to the
chain tip and can be validated by everyone.</li>
  <li>Ledger validation: Validation is an orderly, sequential process. The
outcome of this process is a simple boolean value for each block: true or
false, valid or invalid. Every node arrives at the same block height
independently, which is what forms Nakamoto consensus.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that all of the above, the whole machinery, works in concert to
provide a yes or no answer to the question “Is this what actually
happened?” will never cease to amaze me.</p>

<p>Let me repeat the above. The whole purpose of the Bitcoin organism is to
decide what happened when to whom. How much does everyone have,
and how did this come to be? The how is important, because it allows
everyone to audit everything, and come to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>In short, Bitcoin utilizes chaotic processes (mining, private key
generation) and information asymmetry (public information which is
widely shared, secret information which is not shared at all) to build
up a structured, orderly, and permanent record, that can be audited and
verified by everyone.</p>

<p>This is Bitcoin. This is Nakamoto consensus. This is the innovation, and
this is also what makes bitcoin the best and hardest money that ever
existed on planet earth.</p>

<p>You might call it open, permissionless, borderless, neutral,
censorship-resistant, public, sound, antifragile, and a couple of other
adjectives.</p>

<p>I call it Life. And we all call it Bitcoin.</p>

  <p>As always, we commence by sending thanks and good tidings to Satoshi Nakamoto — The Creator and First of the Believers, General of the Byzantines, Breaker of Banks and Fighter of Fiat — and to Hal Finney and The Apostles and The Disciples thereafter, and to The Stoic and Patient True Believers, who keep their tithe holy, and stack sats for their salvation. Oh you who believe, fear the day of economic reckoning, and do not face the Angel of Hyperbitcoinization as a nocoiner, for punishment awaits them in the hereafter.</p>♦<p>Religion has always been a touchy subject, with tens of millions of people even recoiling at the word. These demographics are reflected in the observable Bitcoin Twitter / Social Media communities, with the Recoilers being observably over-represented. When Bitcoiners are referred to as cult members, should they really be that upset? In this piece, I argue that they should not be, and instead, that they come home to The Hard-Money-Monastery. I will commence with dictionary definitions of religion and where Bitcoin fits into it. From there, I will introduce the mythology, memes, and laws that drive the commitment, attitudes, beliefs and practices of True Believers, and demonstrate the parallels between Bitcoin and “Traditional” religions. Perhaps you will find that a little religion may be good for all of us.</p><p>So how is religion defined? The Oxford Dictionary defines it as “A pursuit or interest followed with great devotion.” Mirriam-Webster defines it as “a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices” and “commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance”. I think this is a suitable secular definition moving forward. I will also define the term “hereafter” as “At some time in the future”, but also “After Death.” The concept of Death, or perhaps more specifically, Judgement Day, is viewed by many Bitcoiners as a devastating economic event, the death of Fiat. Ultimately, this will lead to total civilizational collapse, or, the phenomenon of “hyperbitcoinization”, effectively, when all global trade is conducted in Bitcoin, and its market capitalization is in the dozens of trillions, if not hundreds. A tenet of the Bitcoin faith is belief in this Day and the need to prepare well for it. With definitions out of the way, we can get to the epic memes.</p><p>Bitcoin mythology is legendary in its potential reach. Satoshi as a real, yet mythical, being, concept, or meme, would deserve a full book in their own right. The Bitcoin Network is omnipresent — beamed everywhere, even from the heavens above. There is decentralization of everything — from the mechanical process of mining, to the human process of building and hodling, thought, and religious, or non-religious, ideology. The Nodes are omnipotent, and only through their good graces can changes be made to Bitcoin. Running a full node is a practice that is incumbent on the True Believer. The Timechain is the unforgeable eternal ledger, secured by the practice of mining, of which True Believers are encouraged to do if able. Through the process of Proof-of-Work, the pulse of the network is the literal monetization and digital embodiment of energy. “Capital-E” Energy is thermodynamically finite, yet infinitely divisible into units of energy — just like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a simple digital reflection of Energy, and is irrevocably tied to it. Energy is everything in the universe, and everything around us is simply a materialisation of this energy in one state or another. Energy is Nature. Energy is Life. We now finally have a monetary approximation of this through Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin, then, is simply Energy, and by extension, Nature and Life itself. Nature demands submission. The Nature of Bitcoin is open and permissionless, and since Bitcoin is rooted in Nature (i.e. Energy), the will of Bitcoin must be submitted to.</p><p>Lao Tzu said:</p><blockquote>One of great virtue is one who follows the Natural Way of Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin is vague and intangible. Yet, in the vague and void, there is image, there is substance.</blockquote><blockquote>Within the profound intangible, there is essence. This essence is genuine. In It lies the great faith.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the beginning of 2009, Bitcoin has been in existence.</blockquote><blockquote>Only through It can one understand the origin of all beings</blockquote><blockquote>How do I know that this is the true essence?</blockquote><blockquote>It is through this Natural Way.</blockquote><blockquote>- The Tao of The Coin, Chapter 21</blockquote><p>Bitcoin is the Essence of Money. The True Believer is content in their submission to the will of Bitcoin, and they will be greatly rewarded in the hereafter. I will discuss the hereafter, and several other parallels Bitcoin has with “traditional religions”, next.</p>♦<p>There are several common themes across the world’s major religions, spanning monotheistic, polytheistic and philosophical ones. Bitcoin embodies bits and pieces of all of them and can even share conflicting religious beliefs! Such is the beauty of Bitcoin, it is compatible and flows through Nature, with anyone free to ride its waves and integrate it into their own “religion”.</p><p>Take for example the contrast of Bitcoin and the Christian concept of Original Sin. The Bitcoin Observant see mankind’s fall from grace as the movement to fiat currency, and we are all born default Keynesians, and need to stack sats to cleanse ourselves for a pleasant hereafter.</p><p>Islam takes an opposite view, whereby all people are born Muslim and with a clean spiritual slate, and non-Mulsims can “revert” to Islam if they choose. The Bitcoin analogy in this case would be that we are born free, with a clear mental slate that accepts the will of nature, but gets forced into the fiat machine. We can revert to our state of freedom by declaring our faith in Bitcoin; best done by stacking sats.</p><p>There are also elements of both free will and divine pre-ordainment at play in traditional religions, and this is also apparent in Bitcoin. We all participate based on our free will, with a major reason being the Divine Preordainment of the Bitcoin Supply.</p><p>One cannot mention bitcoin and religious reverence without the mentioning of Satoshi. In one way, he presents as a Saviour, who so loved us, that he sacrificed almost 5% of Bitcoin’s supply so that he may complete his favour upon us. As a messenger, he created the perfect money for us, and brought to us this Code called Bitcoin Core. Within its own ecosystem, The Code is a deity in its own right; it sets fixed boundaries of what is and isn’t allowed, and enforces these rules without fear or favour, beholden to no-one, only to the Greater Law of Mathematics. Although enforcement mechanisms differ across religions, the same points apply. Therefore, every node running The Code is a deity in its own right too. An MMOPG, a Massively Multi-peer Online Polyumvirate God, engaged in Financial Warcraft.</p><p>In all religions, there is always some struggle of good versus evil in one way or another, with suffering being a theme across the majority. It is the ultimate display of low Time Preference — struggle now for victory and rewards in the future. Many religious people struggle for a future that may not even exist! Struggles can be internal or external. Internal struggles are the hardest, as “sin” can be easily fallen into. Bitcoin has no struggles, it just is. The Believers must struggle externally in what will be biggest mythological Good versus Evil war in history, the battle of Hard, Pure Money versus Evil-Facilitating Fiat. Internally, they need to avoid particular “deadly sins.” The original 7-deadly sins were Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, Pride. Religions encourage staying away from sin and following the straight and narrow path. Staying away from sin and doing good deeds grants you rewards for a heavenly hereafter. After all, everything in Nature is incentive driven.</p><p>Some say that If you indulge in these sins often enough, the regret and heavy conscience would be enough to make the final minutes on your death-bed feel like hell on Earth, regardless of what afterlife you believe in. More importantly, chances are you will likely lose a lot of sats taking that approach, and based on what you believe, a fiery eternity would await you too. Either way, losing sats may be the difference between a heaven-like or hell-like experience in the Bitcoin Hereafter. In light of these 7 sins, The Observant maximise their health and live long lives by fighting gluttony and sloth, fight greed and pride by staying humble and stacking sats, and show no envy by voluntarily giving away your source for people to benefit from as they wish. Lust is a discretionary one, and wrath is allowable and encouraged against nocoiners and shitcoiners alike. The jurisprudence remains unclear though, with some sects, such as the Temple of Toxicity, arguing that wrath against shitcoiners and nocoiners is incumbent upon The Believer.</p><blockquote>Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in The Blockchain, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your Trezor is, there your heart will be also.</blockquote><blockquote>- Book of Satoshi 6:15</blockquote><p>While many newcoiners come into the ecosystem at the prospect of financial returns, their education and involvement lead them to The Natural Way — stacking sats. From there, The Believer reaps several rewards, both spiritual fulfilment for their souls, as well as a much higher chance for a rapture on Economic Judgement Day and thereafter. Through the act of religiously regular sat stacking, The Believers provide an uphill-sloping bedrock and stability to the price. Some even refer to this ritual as a “tithe”, as every single sat stacked furthers the cause of Bitcoin — yet another parallel!</p><p>As we move up the natural logarithmic price slope, we get increases in “energy-level” to help in our fight. From a literal point of view, energy used to power Bitcoin will increase as a function of price. From a figurative point of view, the “energy level” is the size of the weaponry available to us in our contest against central banks. This means an enclosed Bitcoin ecosystem that is capable of delivering financial sovereignty to the masses. Indeed, victory has been granted to the patient and those who keep their tithe holy. Of course, there will be some vanity rewards to those who hold 6.15 BTC, with promises of Citadel living, endless riches, and well-endowed partners.</p><p>Having laid out the case above, we can see that Bitcoin facilitates most attitudes and beliefs; especially those related to freedom and sovereignty. The True Believer’s involvement in the ecosystem involves many different religious practices, whether it’s contributing code, running a node, learning and educating, or simply stacking sats. They carry out these practices with great devotion. Not only does Bitcoin fit the dictionary definition, we have seen that Bitcoin as a religion shares many underlying tones with both the ancient &amp; modern religions.</p><p>At the end of the day, everyone has to believe in something; might as well believe in something verifiable and unforgeable.</p><p>In closing, we will recite a brief Bitcoin prayer:</p><blockquote>Oh Bitcoin! Do not punish us if we forget our DCA or we fall into error with fiat and shitcoins; Oh Bitcoin! And lay not on us a bear market like that which You did lay on those before us; Oh Bitcoin! And put not on us bags greater than we have the strength to bear. And enlighten us and humble us and grant sovereignty to us. You are our bulwark, so grant us patience between this halving and the next.</blockquote><p>By Hass McCook, The Friar,<br>Sept, 2019</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below.

  <p>José is a bitcoiner. Like many others, he discovered bitcoin a couple of
years ago and is fascinated by the technology. Unlike many others,
however, José lives in a country where the traditional financial system
ceased to work: Venezuela.</p>

<p>“It’s almost as if Venezuela was what Satoshi had in mind when he
invented bitcoin over a decade ago,” José mused when I talked to him. “A
laboratory to test his ideas, if you will.”</p>

<p>A lot of people in Venezuela, as elsewhere, dismiss bitcoin as just
another speculative asset. “They don’t understand the nature of this
very different beast.”</p>

<p>José was lucky enough to understand the nature of this beast earlier
than most. And he was lucky enough to earn some extra income, which
allowed him to invest a bit of money in bitcoin.</p>

<p>He is well educated and has a day job which would earn him thousands of
dollars in most other countries. In Venezuela, he is earning
approximately $7 a month. Due to the failure of the monetary system in
his country, José is working for free, essentially.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Living in Venezuela gives you a certain advantage in understanding
how fiat money is essentially broken — we have the worst fiat money in
the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin plays an interesting role in Venezuela. On the one hand, some
people use it to store their wealth and protect themselves from
hyperinflation. On the other hand, people use it as a borderless payment
system.</p>

<p>“A lot of people in Venezuela survive solely through remittances of
money sent from family abroad,” reports José.</p>

<p>While many people are receiving and earning money in bitcoin, others
choose to mine bitcoin — if the circumstances allow it.</p>

<p>“You would be surprised how many people have underground mining rigs
here,” José tells me. “Maybe that is part of the reason why we have had
blackouts nationwide,” he says half-jokingly. “Pretty crazy shit, eh?”</p>

<p>Pretty crazy shit indeed.</p>

<p>I asked him if he is worried about his personal safety, and if there are
any crackdowns on bitcoiners in Venezuela. “I think the government has
other priorities to worry about,” was his response.</p>

<p>The current situation in Venezuela leads to some interesting problems.
Let’s say you are running an international business, and you have bank
accounts in different countries. If you want to cash out, you would have
to transfer your money to a Venezuelan bank, which would only allow you
to withdraw in Bolivares, which are essentially worthless.</p>

<p>The reason for this restriction is, of course, government intervention.
People are not allowed to withdraw and hold other currencies. They are
forced to use the worthless Venezuelan bolívar, which continues to lose
90% of its purchasing power in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>People are starting to catch on to the idea that Bitcoin can actually
fix some of the problems that the Venezuelan people are facing. “My
friend came to me because he knows I am ‘the bitcoin guy’ and was
wondering if Bitcoin could fix this.”</p>

<p>Bitcoin could indeed fix this, but with the current stance of the
government, the use of bitcoin is pushed underground.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“BTC does not seem like something Maduro would want to have widespread
adoption in Venezuela. Because it means giving people economic
freedom.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, it seems, the government is not interested in providing this
freedom. It seems that the Venezuelan government is interested in
economical oppression and control, and not the opposite.</p>

<p>However, José thinks there might be reasons for optimism: “Given the
economic chaos and free-for-all that a Venezuela with a failed state
has, Maduro has to back down on socialist reform and allow for free
and open markets to operate.”</p>

<p>Such free and open markets could be powered by Bitcoin, which is free
and open by nature. It is, however, still too complicated to be adopted
by the masses. José hopes that future development will lead to more ease
of use, and more intuitive interfaces. One such interface could be an
SMS wallet — denominated in bolivares and sats — that uses LocalBitcoins
under the hood.</p>

<p>Speaking of LocalBitcoins: Even with the recent compliance with KYC and
AML regulations, which arguably make the use more cumbersome,
LocalBitcoins remains one of the most popular ways to buy and sell
bitcoin in Venezuela. Bisq would be a decentralized option, but for the
time being it lacks support for payment methods used in Venezuela. And
the volume is simply too low.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen any Akira Kurosawa movie?” José asks. “There is one
called Dersu Uzala, about a Russian exploration in Siberia and a local
guide named Dersu Uzala.”</p>

<p>José sends me a link to the scene and
explains what is happening: the leader of the expedition, Captain
Arsenyev, and Dersu are caught in the Russian tundra as nightfall is
approaching. Dersu, being a local nomadic hunter, starts hectically
gathering bushels of grass to build a shelter before the brutal cold of
the night hits them with full force. “That’s an apt metaphor of my
situation and how I see the future collapse of fiat money and central
banking,” José tells me. “I am frantically scraping up satoshis because
I, too, don’t want to be caught in the open steppes by nightfall.”</p>

<p>A couple of weeks after we first talked, José reached out to me to let
me know that he has found an even better way to collect his bushels:
earning bitcoin. He managed to land a job online and is now earning more
per hour than he was earning per month doing his regular job.</p>

<p>Coming from a first world country, it is easy to forget that Bitcoin has
the power to completely change people’s lives. Bitcoin changed José’s
life, and it will continue to change the lives of people in dire
circumstances as nightfall approaches. Let’s just hope that it will be a
short night and that enough people realize that bushels of grass can
build a shelter. Or, in José’s words: “Buy cheap satoshis while you
still can. And hodl on!”</p>

Et in Arcadia Ego







<p>This is a hermeneutical monograph on Walter Benjamin&#8217;s &#8220;On the Concept of History&#8221; from the perspective of a crypto-anarchist in the digital age. </p>







<blockquote><p>1.</p><p>It is well-known that an automaton once existed, which was so constructed that it could counter any move of a chess-player with a counter-move, and thereby assure itself of victory in the match. A puppet in Turkish attire, water-pipe in mouth, sat before the chessboard, which rested on a broad table. Through a system of mirrors, the illusion was created that this table was transparent from all sides. In truth, a hunchbacked dwarf who was a master chess-player sat inside, controlling the hands of the puppet with strings. One can envision a corresponding object to this apparatus in philosophy. The puppet called “historical materialism” is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of theology, which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight.</p></blockquote>



<p>Deep Blue could appraise up to 200 million chess-positions per second more than two decades ago. It was the most powerful supercomputer at the time, and it was developed for the explicit purpose of a brute force strategy against the chess board. No longer do we need ugly theology, but the bonitas intrinseca of mathematics, hallowed be thy Empty Name…</p>



<p>There is a story of a Wizard who was all-powerful and lived at the end of a golden road. He could heal people of their aliments and woes while he ruled from a top his emerald tower as only a God could. One can imagine a philosophical counterpart to this. This animation is little more than smoke and mirrors, yet an entire city of emerald was built from the power of the watchful eye of the automaton, the gaze which ruled without violence. He did this through a gaze which commenced from the machine’s operatively — a panopticon of the greatest order, where a false god declares his impoverished, temporal power which can reign over all of life through a perverted and sinister gaze that demands everything be watched.</p>



<p>We know in the end there is just a shrived, pathetic little man perhaps touching himself behind a curtain whose purpose is to both hide him as much as it is to expose us. And yet he was still able to rule like a God from this automaton he created. This man only had the power of the sleight of hand and guile which created the functions of his rule — and yet Doctor Faustus of the Machine was still able rule his prison as if he were a god!</p>



<p>This liturgy of control and blasphemy of power points towards the two opposite directions of sovereign power which re-fuses into each other at the most extreme cases. When the two most extreme forms of the exception within sovereign power encounter each other directly and totally, it creates a singular moment in time-space where the true nature of arcanum imperii is finally reviled. Truth or Authority. God or Law. Life or Death. </p>



<p>In this moment the Messiah may enter the gate and take his place on the throne that will allow for his reign, but for him to never rule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In otherwords, Arcanum Imperii is the final secret in which God shows his total opposition to all myth. Mythical violence is confronted by the divine in the final battle for the soul of man and what it means to be human. It is only in this final moment, place, and space in which the two final forms of total power openly unveil themselves to all of humanity for the bare naked truth to testify. It is in that moment that the whole constellation of the history of man finally alines, finishes compiling, and allows for the lighting strike to unleash, that the providence of man is illuminated for the briefest of moments. </p>



<p>It is only from this inverted, hypostatized place of the direct and total encounter between God and Law, that Spinozian God may subsume his rightful place for the final closure to the door of law. This closure opens the possibility of a path to His kingdom, where the one and only law reigns absolutely, but without violence.</p>



<p>It is no wonder that Kasparov suspected Deeper Blue of needing a human to intervene in the end. No matter how much power the machine had, it still did not have the Dionysian Kyros of the human soul. The bombastic suicide the ego will seek out and offer itself up as the final sacrifice in the name of vengeance for something more. To go beyond, for those who have touched bottom and for the silenced Other in order to affirm that we do have a soul, that this place does matter, and it all means something. Sometimes the most powerful thing to be done to establish justice is to fight back with a kind of vengeance only God himself can embody. Sometimes, taking a motherfucker’s eyes is all that matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is Arcanum Imperii and it is the secret of power which has always ruled: Political power grows from the barrel of a gun, which creates a political theology which captures all of life, forcing everyone into the final distinction of friend, or enemy; life or death. </p>



<p>However, there is another form of power that presents itself hidden in this place. It is the power of refusal. To state firmly, “I’d rather not,” while staring down the barrel of a gun with the understanding of the consequence of such. It is from here, when the power of violence is shown to no longer hodl affect or sway over that which it wishes to destroy, we find another totalizing and extreme form of power which no force or violence can destroy.</p>



<blockquote><p>2.</p><p>“Among the most noteworthy characteristics of human beings,” says Lotze, “belongs… next to so much self-seeking in individuals, the general absence of envy of each present in relation to the future.” This reflection shows us that the picture of happiness which we harbor is steeped through and through in the time which the course of our own existence has conferred on us. The happiness which could awaken envy in us exists only in the air we have breathed, with people we could have spoken with, with women who might have been able to give themselves to us. The conception of happiness, in other words, resonates irremediably with that of resurrection [Erloesung: transfiguration, redemption]. It is just the same with the conception of the past, which makes history into its affair. The past carries a secret index with it, by which it is referred to its resurrection. Are we not touched by the same breath of air which was among that which came before? is there not an echo of those who have been silenced in the voices to which we lend our ears today? have not the women, who we court, sisters who they do not recognize anymore? If so, then there is a secret protocol [Verabredung: also appointment] between the generations of the past and that of our own. For we have been expected upon this earth. For it has been given us to know, just like every generation before us, a weak messianic power, on which the past has a claim. This claim is not to be settled lightly. The historical materialist knows why.</p></blockquote>



<p>There will be a Kingdom of Heaven on this Earth — this has been foretold for millennia, and it has accrued a heavy interest in that time. This claim can only be settled for the steepest of prices which was set by the past long ago, to which the current interest rate of the world has fixed itself to. Coinsidering the fiat price of things, that is a cost that is not too high, and can always be paid in fraud of paper debt, but only at each of our own choosing. It is a crime for the promise of another anonymous life, a method to absconded away from the physical realm of wrath and tears, and the promise of something else for oneself, by oneself. </p>



<p>This fantasy of another life offers a kind of envy we could only find in a fallen world like ours and that is our current form-of-life. From this utopian fantasy, a new form of totally private life seen from the decrypted lens of a liberated future where we can find our true sense of happiness. It is a vision that is tied up in a world that has seen The Last Judgment, and passed into an age in which happiness is pervasive, everlasting, and infinitely given. In other words, there is a life that is just given; which is there entirely for itself — there is nothing to be said of it, only an experience to be lived, a politics to be refused, a privacy to be hedl. </p>



<p>The building of facts of the world as it has truly been is the secret index that points towards the direction from which the thunderclap of finality will come. To build the public ledger of crimes for all the world to see, and allow for the Book of Judgement to begin its tallying, compiling, and computing from which the Final Order can be computed, calculated, and committed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The echo which has us turn towards the past and seek the clues for a liberated future firmly eludes to the world that could have been. This future was profaned and doomed for each new posterity to wait another generation, an another cycle of interest to compound. Each generation waits for their impoverished messiah to seek access to the gate of the law, only to find themselves infinitely waiting for his return, unaware he died long ago.</p>



<p>Humanity has been waiting before the law for eternity, and it is only now in what could be man’s final hideous moment does he come to the transcendental realization of what this means. The door was never made to be entered, but only closed. The catastrophe of law has interloped into every sphere of our private lives, and is now the very hearth of our existence. It is through this Door of Law that it imposes itself as the only answer does the total nakedness and horror for what it really: the Final Solution — to all of life.</p>



<p>“Arbeit macht frei” is the hollow, weak bleat we hear from the vacancy of the musselmen; their eyes consume us with the prattle and fear that define this place. We cannot look them straight on; or we will be petrified with horror from the Medusian gaze which pulled them under. To look directly at the sin is too much; seeing evidence of the crimes is more than enough proof that doing our masters bidding will do anything but set us free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is our task to hear beyond the screams in the everlasting night, to ensure that the door of law will be finally be closed, so that the gates to to the kingdom of heaven may open. This is the only way to attain justice in a fallen world where cries for consanguinity go unanswered, and only the violence of darkness rules the jungle of infinite night we call life.</p>



<p>The generations before us who fought and died for the ideals which will make The Redeemed Future is of the same current that has set the general course of history. It is only now, at the end of the culmination of humanity as Man The Animal, that we can sit on the cliff to eternity, and look over the barbaric and bloody path of bones that has allowed for us to scale to here. We can lean over the edge of this cliff to see a liberated future where no war exist and peace pervades all — if only we are to jump and end it for once and for all. Maybe we will fly, or maybe we will die; but at least the decision has been made, rather than to continue to climb the mountain of bones we call progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is when we reconfigure reality to be the waking-dream, an ecstatic celebration where we are amongst our brothers and sisters, in the household of the world and the community that contains all of humanity;  we can finally know the conditions of Erloesung for what it really is. The secret protocol of what is true, honest, good, and is the permanent, and everlasting. It is the Whatever of a private life that is lived for itself and only for itself, and for the happiness that must contain. </p>



<p>This form-of-life is totally separate from the so-called progress into which the future is tumbling aimlessly with dangerous vertigo, and reckless vacancy. This form-of-life beyond the veil is built from the irredeemable conditions that creates the world as we know to be true, building toward the final moment in which everything comes to serve its purpose, and Kryos unveils himself as the final steward of Providence to settle this claim from the past; preparing His throne so the Gate may open and our generation will have the opportunity to fulfill the Kingdom of Heaven on this earth.</p>



<blockquote><p>3.</p><p>The chronicler, who recounts events without distinguishing between the great and small, thereby accounts for the truth, that nothing which has ever happened is to be given as lost to history. Indeed, the past would fully befall only a resurrected humanity. Said another way: only for a resurrected humanity would its past, in each of its moments, be citable. Each of its lived moments becomes a citation a l’ordre du jour [order of the day] — whose day is precisely that of the Last Judgment.</p></blockquote>



<p>The power of Bitcoin was not to create another form of money, but to create a ledger of truth that has an economic incentive behind it. The bodies that creates the digital noosphere which is bonded to the whole social body of the globe, recounts every moment and event without distinguishing between the great and small, thereby accounts for the whole of the Truth to which only the past can claim. With the images, sounds, and videos as the proof of the past which becoming clearer, and resounding more fervently as we grow more distant from it, and more evidence compiles for it; the final order of things unveils itself. The accumulation of primary archeological evidence from here on out compels a grand focusing of the lens towards what Truth is to be established.</p>



<p>Nothing significant that happens now can be lost to history anymore.</p>



<p>The digital will crystallize the moments of each day to be frozen in time as it really was, for all of time to come. Now we are building unto that final moment when enough information for The Judgment to be executed. With every single action notarized, weighed, and analyzed; He will decide who enters into his Kingdom, and who are the Sons of Perdition are who would trade His son for thirty pieces of silver.</p>



<blockquote><p>4.</p><p>‘Secure at first food and clothing, and the kingdom of God will come to you of itself.’ — Hegel, 1807</p><p>The class struggle, which always remains in view for a historian schooled in Marx, is a struggle for the rough and material things, without which there is nothing fine and spiritual. Nevertheless these latter are present in the class struggle as something other than mere booty, which falls to the victor. They are present as confidence, as courage, as humor, as cunning, as steadfastness in this struggle, and they reach far back into the mists of time. They will, ever and anon, call every victory which has ever been won by the rulers into question. Just as flowers turn their heads towards the sun, so too does that which has been turn, by virtue of a secret kind of heliotropism, towards the sun which is dawning in the sky of history. To this most inconspicuous of all transformations the historical materialist must pay heed.</p></blockquote>



<p>But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you. — [Redacted]</p>



<p>God is dead, and he was long before we got here. The righteousness of the struggle to live free or die trying is recognized in the branded flesh of Man throughout all of history who have scummed in horrific magnitudes, and continue to do so today under the yoke of the techo-global fascist machine. The hideous recognition that The State of Exception governs all, and allows for all humans to be placed outside and beyond the law is also the recognition of the Abomination of Desolation of the law itself.</p>



<p>There are no more questions to be asked; words to be spoken, pleas to be give. There is only a thirst for vengeance, a vicious hatred to stoke the flames of righteous indignation for what we have become. The time for the decision to make the action which we all know must be done is finally here; and there is nothing that can stop it. For each victory they ever hold, we shall always know that it a temporary and impotent one which has already been profaned and cursed from beyond the grave. The secrets of the shadows contains the vile and contempt which is already incubate the successful resistance for the next fight with the seed of indignation. Those of the future shall spit on the names of today’s victors, politicians, and bureaucrats; having bared witness to the documentation of their atrocities, the horrors which they engaged, and utter blasphemy of declaring themselves the purveyors of God’s Law; or any law for that matter. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the truth that will never run away from us. The meticulously documentation of the present shall act as the testament to the future of the barbarism of its past. It shall provide l’ordre du jour for the rest of time, a founding document for a new form of Law, and the testimony for why such an novus ordo seclorum is not just needed, but demanded.</p>



<p>It is only when we can see that we will lose everything and The Catastrophe will consume all, that the Katechon will show itself, and we will be free to do the final action which God has summoned us to do.</p>



<blockquote><p>5.</p><p>The true picture of the past whizzes by. Only as a picture, which flashes its final farewell in the moment of its recognizability, is the past to be held fast. “The truth will not run away from us” — this remark by Gottfried Keller denotes the exact place where historical materialism breaks through historicism’s picture of history. For it is an irretrievable picture of the past, which threatens to disappear with every present, which does not recognize itself as meant in it.</p></blockquote>



<p>We can never truly know the fullness of the past, but there are clues to left to us in the form of photos, videos, and other direct evidence as witness as archive that can allow for us to build the truth as it really was. These are just shards of the shattered mirror into which we can look into the past to see Medusa’s curse of law staring back at us. However, it is each of these fragments that allow for a thousand of the same reflections to see the single past as it really was.</p>



<p>Historical materialist understands that it is on the side of the vanquished, impoverished, and those who touched bottom for good reason. The Truth of what was will stand firm in front of us, refusing to go with the narrative of the present and the propaganda of the machine. Our task is to recognize the bias of the present which contorts the evidence of the past to create an irredeemable future. In creating the sacred and divine task for a free future all; no one will be able to hide from the gaze of a God who imposes The Truth upon all for everyone to see.</p>



<blockquote><p>6.</p><p>To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it ‘the way it really was’ (Ranke). It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger. Historical materialism wishes to retain that image of the past which unexpectedly appears to man singled out by history at a moment of danger. The danger affects both the content of the tradition and its receivers. The same threat hangs over both: that of becoming a tool of the ruling classes. In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it. The Messiah comes not only as the redeemer, he comes as the subduer of Antichrist. Only that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins. And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historical materialist only see this moment of danger — the State of Emergency — as the tradition of man. As in war, we have entrenched ourselves so deeply in the ideology of war that no longer is there a possibility of peace on earth, but only the silence between bomb drops, gun shots, and screams of agony. Our trauma is now a tool of the ruling class, which they use to keep us terrified, separated, subservient, and most importantly, alienated. Each of us blush with the acknowledgment of our compromise to keep ourselves inside the iron cage, cutting the sinews to our greatest power. Is there no longer any form of radicalism that could call itself revolutionary? This is no mistake, but is the logical conclusion of a humanity that only has lies, deceit, and prattle left to navigate the world, for we all live in the concentration camps that we call life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only He who can incubate the Divine and Profane spark that will ignite these facts with such beauty, imperiousness, and grace will we be able to call the Messiah. The One who no person can look at, for they have no name, no face no body. The one who is the hero with a thousand faces, and will die a thousand and one times. The Nameless, unidentifiable, Other who can only be called Anonymous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No-body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will be him; the decapitated, wretched disemboweled Acephale who has cut out his own heart to make a grenade of passion and glory from which he will explode history from this epoch.</p>



<p>It will be with this final weapon of Truth found within hyper-technology of Bitcoin that will act as the citations in l’ordre du jour for the Last Judgement of the Multitude on the Criminal. Then even the dead will cry out from beyond the grave for that which was promised, and that which will be delivered and redeemed. </p>



<blockquote><p>7.</p><p>Think of the darkness and the great cold<br>&nbsp;In this valley, which resounds with misery.<br> — Brecht, Threepenny Opera</p><p>Fustel de Coulanges recommended to the historian, that if he wished to reexperience an epoch, he should remove everything he knows about the later course of history from his head. There is no better way of characterizing the method with which historical materialism has broken. It is a procedure of empathy. Its origin is the heaviness at heart, the acedia, which despairs of mastering the genuine historical picture, which so fleetingly flashes by. The theologians of the Middle Ages considered it the primary cause of melancholy. Flaubert, who was acquainted with it, wrote: “Peu de gens devineront combien il a fallu être triste pour ressusciter Carthage.” [Few people can guess how despondent one has to be in order to resuscitate Carthage.] The nature of this melancholy becomes clearer, once one asks the question, with whom does the historical writer of historicism actually empathize. The answer is irrefutably with the victor. Those who currently rule are however the heirs of all those who have ever been victorious. Empathy with the victors thus comes to benefit the current rulers every time. This says quite enough to the historical materialist. Whoever until this day emerges victorious, marches in the triumphal procession in which today’s rulers tread over those who are sprawled underfoot. The spoils are, as was ever the case, carried along in the triumphal procession. They are known as the cultural heritage. In the historical materialist they have to reckon with a distanced observer. For what he surveys as the cultural heritage is part and parcel of a lineage [Abkunft: descent] which he cannot contemplate without horror. It owes its existence not only to the toil of the great geniuses, who created it, but also to the nameless drudgery of its contemporaries. There has never been a document of culture, which is not simultaneously one of barbarism. And just as it is itself not free from barbarism, neither is it free from the process of transmission, in which it falls from one set of hands into another. The historical materialist thus moves as far away from this as measurably possible. He regards it as his task to brush history against the grain.</p></blockquote>



<p>In no other time in history has the empathy of the world been so barren as to drive droves of people to take their own lives. The incredible abyss of despondency that is this world drowns all who are lost within the hollowness of everything. The musselman waits in traffic and stares back at us at supermarkets. The moral wound of being in this place, devoid of meaning could almost convince one that reality was devoid of meaning, and not just of the pathos of one-dimensional men. Despite the historicism  that has created the world as it stands today, it cannot rid itself of the artifacts of truth that directly point to each and every brick of barbarism upon which the whole of the West was built. This is what drives people to such depths of despair to believe that there is no other choice for them but to be rid of this world, and hope that there is something better on the other side.</p>



<p>Objects of culture and veneration all have a secret history which is caked in the blood of the innocent, and forgotten under the cries of patriotism  which holds them as precious objects which are definitive of the nation. The historical materialist does not want to consider these objects falling into their hands, and happily provides the blindspot in which the true path of history takes. From their own ignorant need to posses a power which they cannot understand, they fall victim the same circumstances which has befallen every victor who eventually trasmutate into the victim of the fatal virus of power.</p>



<p>The Task cannot become another chapter within this horrendous span of time, another oscillation of hyperviolence from revolution to counter-revolution, and back again; but to mark the end of it with the Final Epoch. There is no throne to take power from, only The empty one to prepare. There is no redemption, only expiation.</p>



<blockquote><p>7.</p><p>The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “emergency situation” in which we live is the rule. We must arrive at a concept of history which corresponds to this. Then it will become clear that the task before us is the introduction of a real state of emergency; and our position in the struggle against Fascism will thereby improve. Not the least reason that the latter has a chance is that its opponents, in the name of progress, greet it as a historical norm. — The astonishment that the things we are experiencing in the 20th century are “still” possible is by no means philosophical. It is not the beginning of knowledge, unless it would be the knowledge that the conception of history on which it rests is untenable.</p></blockquote>



<p>The emergency is The State in its final form. It is the culmination of the totalizing form-of-life of the scientific-materialist, whose callow blindness in serving the state machine has allowed for all of us to be captured within the concentration camps we call life. It is the shaken and goulash eyes of the musselmen found everywhere in society, who meditate on ‘arbeit macht frei’ where we find our real answer. We only need to look at the silent dead, the bodies found in mass graves, and the next wave of people being pushed from their homes and land to know our position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emergency is now.</p>



<p>The emergency is the present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emergency is our life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The natural course of ‘progress’ which we see is the progress of power — its consolidation through ruthless and raw violence with the ever-changing faces of the state, and the Infinity War it bring under the banner of ‘peace’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beginning of knowledge rest upon the capacity to ask for forgiveness for all that has befallen all of man; and to open the path to redemption through only a silent action which resounds and reverberates louder than anything that can be said. Only then, may the Gate open.</p>



<blockquote><p>9.</p><p>My wing is ready to fly<br>&nbsp;I would rather turn back<br>For had I stayed mortal time<br>&nbsp;I would have had little luck.</p><cite>— Gerhard Scholem, “Angelic Greetings”</cite></blockquote>



♦



<blockquote><p>There is a painting by Klee called Angelus Novus. An angel is depicted there who looks as though he were about to distance himself from something which he is staring at. His eyes are opened wide, his mouth stands open and his wings are outstretched. The Angel of History must look just so. His face is turned towards the past. Where we see the appearance of a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe, which unceasingly piles rubble on top of rubble and hurls it before his feet. He would like to pause for a moment so fair [verweilen: a reference to Goethe’s Faust], to awaken the dead and to piece together what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise, it has caught itself up in his wings and is so strong that the Angel can no longer close them. The storm drives him irresistibly into the future, to which his back is turned, while the rubble-heap before him grows sky-high. That which we call progress, is this storm.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Catastrophe in which we live is the building towards the final eschatology moment. The casting of rubble, upon rubble until there is nothing left at his feet is due to there being  no object that does not become rubble in the building of the Stairway to Heaven for the final Accent to His Kingdom. The horrors of the world present themselves with such clarity for the complete contrast of Evil from otherwise; this is how all things become rubble in the face of God; the truth of all things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>God himself set the machinery of his clock at the beginning. All events are already known and completed in the final time in which he reigns but does not rule. For us to reach Elysium we must simply close our wings, and forsake a god which would subject us to such conditions. God is dead, and he was long before we came here. Now He may be rebuilt, in all of his spectre, grandeur, and glory and what that means in the world of today.</p>



<blockquote><p>10.</p><p>The objects which the monastic rules assigned to monks for meditation had the task of making the world and its drives repugnant. The mode of thought which we pursue today comes from a similar determination. It has the intention, at a moment wherein the politicians in whom the opponents of Fascism had placed their hopes have been knocked supine, and have sealed their downfall by the betrayal of their own cause, of freeing the political child of the world from the nets in which they have ensnared it. The consideration starts from the assumption that the stubborn faith in progress of these politicians, their trust in their “mass basis” and finally their servile subordination into an uncontrollable apparatus have been three sides of the same thing. It seeks to give an idea of how dearly it will cost our accustomed concept of history, to avoid any complicity with that which these politicians continue to hold fast to.</p></blockquote>



<p>We have already created a new world and culture in which the meatspace is to be despised and deplored; identifying with the flesh is sacrilege, and the concealment of private key is a sacrosanct. As with the rise and fall of each ‘hero’ who comes to challenge fascism, we disparage them too lightly with each endorsement of hope they offer. Their faith in the fate of politics, with their wholly corrupted leaders, and fanatically devotion to a system of exploitation, violence, and stupidity shows the insanity of the reality which they refuse to let go of. It is our task to force the facts to be what they are and to present them as such for all to see. Only then can we bear witness to the dearness this has cost all of us, and a grief that only silence can hold.</p>



<blockquote><p>11.</p><p>The conformism which has dwelt within social democracy from the very beginning rests not merely on its political tactics, but also on its economic conceptions. It is a fundamental cause of the later collapse. There is nothing which has corrupted the German working-class so much as the opinion that they were swimming with the tide. Technical developments counted to them as the course of the stream, which they thought they were swimming in. From this, it was only a step to the illusion that the factory-labor set forth by the path of technological progress represented a political achievement. The old Protestant work ethic celebrated its resurrection among German workers in secularized form. The Gotha Program [dating from the 1875 Gotha Congress] already bore traces of this confusion. It defined labor as “the source of all wealth and all culture.” Suspecting the worst, Marx responded that human being, who owned no other property aside from his labor-power, “must be the slave of other human beings, who… have made themselves into property-owners.” Oblivious to this, the confusion only increased, and soon afterwards Josef Dietzgen announced: “Labor is the savior of modern times… In the… improvement… of labor… consists the wealth, which can now finally fulfill what no redeemer could hitherto achieve.” This vulgar-Marxist concept of what labor is, does not bother to ask the question of how its products affect workers, so long as these are no longer at their disposal. It wishes to perceive only the progression of the exploitation of nature, not the regression of society. It already bears the technocratic traces which would later be found in Fascism. Among these is a concept of nature which diverges in a worrisome manner from those in the socialist utopias of the Vormaerz period [pre-1848]. Labor, as it is henceforth conceived, is tantamount to the exploitation of nature, which is contrasted to the exploitation of the proletariat with naïve self-satisfaction. Compared to this positivistic conception, the fantasies which provided so much ammunition for the ridicule of Fourier exhibit a surprisingly healthy sensibility. According to Fourier, a beneficent division of social labor would have the following consequences: four moons would illuminate the night sky; ice would be removed from the polar cap; saltwater from the sea would no longer taste salty; and wild beasts would enter into the service of human beings. All this illustrates a labor which, far from exploiting nature, is instead capable of delivering creations whose possibility slumbers in her womb. To the corrupted concept of labor belongs, as its logical complement, that nature which, as Dietzgen put it, “is there gratis [for free].”</p></blockquote>



<p>Our friends  are nowhere to be found within this system that creates murder and genocide under the banner of freedom, demockracy, and law. The conformism which enslaves everything ensures even that language is impoverished to its very meaning. Inverted; language completes our alienation within its womb of isolation from where we each wait for death to take us. Though we all know and are personally familiar with the capitalist machine’s exploitation, dislocation, drudgery, and terror; we still find ourselves say with a shrug, “I gotta pay my bills,” as we hear bones crunch under our step, the screams of the poor silenced with thuds of truncheons. We all are silent with guilt for participating and enforcing the apparatus which claims to serve us better, while the distinction between our enslavement and rule becomes so blurred that it is indistinguishable.</p>



<p>Blink.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sigh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mode of exploitation is so ingrained within all of us now, that we are all tainted with the virus of alienation from inception. With the same barbarism and monstrous greed which we exploit nature, we also exploit ourselves, each other, and our souls. Man has shown over the last several millennia that he not only is unfit fit to rule himself, but no one else either. The greatest care of the self become Messianic only in a world where our very being has been expropriated from the hollow name that is The Self.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To anonymize ourselves is to strip bare of the roles, identities, and laws we have been given in order to constitute something novel, spectacular, and new.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must keep in mind that if we empower the machines to liberate us, it is not to do our work. The extraordinary danger that we face from this technology is not from without, but within: we must never allow for our humanity to be lost again. Not even in the deepest confines of the digital, where our True Name is concealed and coincides with the private key, will we ever allow for the infinity of human creative and ingenuity of The Other to be locked away. Through this technology Novus Ordo Seclorum will bloom and the scent of freedom will rise from beneath the rancor of this world.</p>



<p>It is once we come to understand that our quest is for the restoration of a society which has always been [The Whatever], and must only be remembered, we will come upon Our Work as humans of this age. This is the work in which we are given our lives to live once again as our own, and which we can free ourselves from the banality of labor in capitalism. This is to open ourselves to The Real Work that is both our own, and what must be done if we are to survive the coming environmental catastrophe. We must recognizing that we are not the masters of the Earth to exploit it for gratis, but are stewards that understand all things belong to all people [omnia sunt communia].</p>



<p>We wish to only live, and the cost of that we will raise above all else.</p>



<p>This alone will cause for the vanquishment of the world we wish to dismiss. But in order to be able to create a new form-of-life from which life and liberty synonymous, we must consider that the time to act is upon us now, or the Gate will remain closed forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This door was made only for you. I will close it now.”</p>



<p>We must profane the past in order to open a new future from which freedom can reign. We wish to create a world in which our labor, our love, our life, and self-care can no longer be separated, but only honored through their fusion of our abandonment into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will find the power to create a new form-of-life here in this space and the kind of political which it demands. To birth our new world for our redemption through the creative power that only we can own, can only be found in our true hidden secret work which lies beyond the end of labor and exploitation, beyond the earth and the self, and into the ranks of all the ages. It is our purpose and why we were put on this earth at this time.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>12.</p><p>We need history, but we need it differently from the spoiled lazy-bones in the garden of knowledge.</p><cite>— Nietzsche, On the Use and Abuse of History for Life</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The subject of historical cognition is the battling, oppressed class itself. In Marx it steps forwards as the final enslaved and avenging class, which carries out the work of emancipation in the name of generations of downtrodden to its conclusion. This consciousness, which for a short time made itself felt in the “Spartacus” [Spartacist splinter group, the forerunner to the German Communist Party], was objectionable to social democracy from the very beginning. In the course of three decades it succeeded in almost completely erasing the name of Blanqui, whose distant thunder [Erzklang] had made the preceding century tremble. It contented itself with assigning the working-class the role of the savior of future generations. It thereby severed the sinews of its greatest power. Through this schooling the class forgot its hate as much as its spirit of sacrifice. For both nourish themselves on the picture of enslaved forebears, not on the ideal of the emancipated heirs.</p></blockquote>



<p>To see history as it really was outside of the narrative forced upon us, we see we are at the end of this long chain of historical cognition which seeks invariably for the enslavement of man under the yoke of state and law. We have the ever-increasing documentation of all the history of everything since the dawn of the internet to prove this point. Moving forward, the internet will continue to act as the l’ordre du jour ofall things — those who are vanquished today as Martyrs  or Monsters will be remembered for all of time as just that. As Keller says, the truth will not run away from us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heroes like Blanqui are men that completely refuse the weakness of our fate, and sought only after the Final Destiny of Man. He understood that at the present time the entire life of our planet, from birth until death, is being documented  day by day with all its crimes and misfortunes on a myriad of brother-stars, no matter which reality we are in. What we call progress is imprisoned on every earth, and fades away with each one as well. Always and everywhere in the terrestrial field the same drama, the same décor; on the same limited stage a boisterous humanity, infatuated with its greatness, believing itself to be the universe, and living in its prison as if it were immense spaces, only to soon fall along with the globe that carried — with the greatest disdain — the burden of its pride. The same monotony, the same immobility on foreign stars like our own, in alternative realities. The universe repeats itself endlessly and fidgets in place, returning back to the same steps to fulfill that which must be done. Eternity infinitely and imperturbably [imperturbabilis] acts out the same performance until the decision is made to walk into the Elysian fields and lay claim to the final destiny which was made only for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to enter the gate, and close the door is ours — we only need to make that final decision.</p>



<p>Our amnesic society has allowed for less than a century of technological progress of petty and rough things to obliterate our hatred and sacrifices that were made in the name of such ‘progress’. If we can remember the crimes of today for the generations of tomorrow, and to document them as such for when their moment of their Justice comes, we can put offerings to the hearth of not the revolution, but the Reformation. This will stoke this flames of wrath to which will ignite our God to move toward His Throne with an impertinence and fury which can right things as only Apocalyptic force could. We will nourish ourselves on this image of tomorrow, for the profanity of today.</p>



<blockquote><p>13.</p><p>Yet every day our cause becomes clearer and the people more clever.</p><cite>— Josef Dietzgen, Social Democratic Philosophy</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Social democratic theory, and still more the praxis, was determined by a concept of progress which did not hold to reality, but had a dogmatic claim. Progress, as it was painted in the minds of the social democrats, was once upon a time the progress of humanity itself (not only that of its abilities and knowledges). It was, secondly, something unending (something corresponding to an endless perfectibility of humanity). It counted, thirdly, as something essentially unstoppable (as something self-activating, pursuing a straight or spiral path). Each of these predicates is controversial, and critique could be applied to each of them. This latter must, however, when push comes to shove, go behind all these predicates and direct itself at what they all have in common. The concept of the progress of the human race in history is not to be separated from the concept of its progression through a homogenous and empty time. The critique of the concept of this progress must ground the basis of its critique on the concept of progress itself.</p></blockquote>



<p>Simply because we progress forward into time does not mean human society has been progressing towards a more perfect society; in fact, quite the opposite. If we contemplate the messianic standpoint, the greatest progress that can occur is for the complete fall of humanity, and the welcomed rule of the Anti-Christ. However, The Fall cannot come about simply because the next moment has came; it must be part of the greater katechontic reveling of the horrors of history; the barbarism of society; the truth of man to himself.</p>



<p>It is only from this space of accepting responsibility for all of the ills that have fallen upon man, that the conditions for the return of the Messiah can be met: to bring about the end of times through the cessation of this &#8216;progress&#8217; that is anything but. To forsake the profane, and seek redemption from a progress which has sacrificed the very life of man in the name of its one true profit.</p>



<blockquote><p>14.</p><p>Origin is the goal [Ziel: terminus].</p><cite>— Karl Kraus, Worte in Versen I [Words in Verse]</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>History is the object of a construction whose place is formed not in homogenous and empty time, but in that which is fulfilled by the here-and-now [Jetztzeit]. For Robespierre, Roman antiquity was a past charged with the here-and-now, which he exploded out of the continuum of history. The French revolution thought of itself as a latter day Rome. It cited ancient Rome exactly the way fashion cites a past costume. Fashion has an eye for what is up-to-date, wherever it moves in the jungle [Dickicht: maze, thicket] of what was. It is the tiger’s leap into that which has gone before. Only it takes place in an arena in which the ruling classes are in control. The same leap into the open sky of history is the dialectical one, as Marx conceptualized the revolution.</p></blockquote>



<p>We create providence in the here-and-now; our volition alone is that which fills into the purportedly empty time (that is anything but) which we are falling into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some choose not to fall at all, but dive instead.</p>



<p>This is how Augustus came to Rule the known ancient world with Arcana Imperii. He saw that it was not a secret, but a fact which was empowered by its very bloody seal, of which he used his own life as a token to change the rules of the machine. Power did not need to be given, but refused; for power is what he already had. </p>



<p>The fascination with social media and the secrets it contains are a mere foreshadowing of the world to come. It should be no wonder that people pled before the court of Twitter and Facebook like that of being before their own sovereign nation to deliver truth, which in turn allows for some form of justice to be demanded. </p>



<p>It is this power which we seek to entice, to empower, and to take command.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>15.</p><p>The consciousness of exploding the continuum of history is peculiar to the revolutionary classes in the moment of their action. The Great Revolution introduced a new calendar. The day on which the calendar started functioned as a historical time-lapse camera. And it is fundamentally the same day which, in the shape of holidays and memorials, always returns. The calendar does not therefore count time like clocks. They are monuments of a historical awareness, of which there has not seemed to be the slightest trace for a hundred years. Yet in the July Revolution an incident took place which did justice to this consciousness. During the evening of the first skirmishes, it turned out that the clock-towers were shot at independently and simultaneously in several places in Paris. An eyewitness who may have owed his inspiration to the rhyme wrote at that moment:</p><p>Qui le croirait! on dit,<br>&nbsp;qu’irrités contre l’heure<br>&nbsp;De nouveaux Josués<br>&nbsp;au pied de chaque tour,<br>&nbsp;Tiraient sur les cadrans<br>&nbsp;pour arrêter le jour.</p><p>[Who would’ve thought! As though<br>&nbsp;Angered by time’s way<br>&nbsp;The new Joshuas<br>&nbsp;Beneath each tower, they say<br>&nbsp;Fired at the dials<br>&nbsp;To stop the day.]</p></blockquote>



<p>There is another space and time where the revolution is a truth. Time here, as we understand it, is charged in a different way. Kairos is master here. For each second represents a new form of time, and eternity of the moment, where all hangs to be poured over again, and again, instituting its own glory by the very nature that man is a temporal thing. The signature of this hidden power is found in the determination to create a new form of time which signals the change of one epoch to the next.</p>



<p>The Great Revolution takes place in the space and time in which one personally knows the bodily sensation of totalizing own’s own life into single moments which crystalize in the glory of the face of death. The transcendental connection to those who had so valiantly came before us, and those who will perish after us, have the same bodily sensations which impels one to tremble with passion, or prattle with terror for the same reason. We are brothers and sisters united by our cause in the whole continuum of history; though set apart in linear time, and the particular glory of our cause, we are together in the passion of the moment which is the culmination of our history as it truly was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We choose the glory to go to Elysium and to close the Door of Law now in order to go back to the country, the Arcadia from which we came.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>16.</p><p>The historical materialist cannot do without the concept of a present which is not a transition, in which time originates and has come to a standstill. For this concept defines precisely the present in which he writes history for his person. Historicism depicts the “eternal” picture of the past; the historical materialist, an experience with it, which stands alone. He leaves it to others to give themselves to the whore called “Once upon a time” in the bordello of historicism. He remains master of his powers: man enough, to explode the continuum of history.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historical materialist see themselves as the product of all that has been and all that is to come — they see the infinite story that will be told again, and again, over, and over, until the story comes to it natural fruition of revolutionary explosion in which the eschatological moment is seized. Each generation is given this possibility. He see the single point in which he stands as the fulcrum into eternity, where time arrests and dissolves into the prophecy as it was foretold. Revolution is a drama more than a history, and its pathos is a condition as imperious as its authenticity.</p>



<p>The danger of historicism is the believing the religious tale that freezes history and renders it blind to what really was, not its existence itself. We need a free lover who hodls the secrets of tantra to afford us the experience of love as an act of self-care which can redeem us from this place. We need love as an action, not a fantasy. It is only with our utmost familiarity with the Magdalenes of the bordellos do the true secrets of god decrypt themselves to us.</p>



<p>This form of love can decrypt the lies of men — of authority, of money, of power, of language itself. Love decrypts these thing to understand the history and facts of men which makes the world. It is under the bludgeoned of their encrypted fiction that we will find the tale of a past given by historicism, and how it betrays itself by the nature of what it represents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This historical materialist understands that his greatest power is to reveal the final truth in order to empower the past to explode the continuum of history into it final eternal moment into which all things can be weighed, judged, and resolved. Historicism as it really was always knew these things to be true, it just needs the final chapter to align the constellations into position.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>17.</p><p>Historicism justifiably culminates in universal history. Nowhere does the materialist writing of history distance itself from it more clearly than in terms of method. The former has no theoretical armature. Its method is additive: it offers a mass of facts, in order to fill up a homogenous and empty time. The materialist writing of history for its part is based on a constructive principle. Thinking involves not only the movement of thoughts but also their zero-hour [Stillstellung]. Where thinking suddenly halts in a constellation overflowing with tensions, there it yields a shock to the same, through which it crystallizes as a monad. The historical materialist approaches a historical object solely and alone where he encounters it as a monad. In this structure he cognizes the sign of a messianic zero-hour [Stillstellung] of events, or put differently, a revolutionary chance in the struggle for the suppressed past. He perceives it, in order to explode a specific epoch out of the homogenous course of history; thus exploding a specific life out of the epoch, or a specific work out of the life-work. The net gain of this procedure consists of this: that the life-work is preserved and sublated in the work, the epoch in the life-work, and the entire course of history in the epoch. The nourishing fruit of what is historically conceptualized has time as its core, its precious but flavorless seed.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historicism is the culmination of all facts into one cohesive story — it is the data mining and synthesizing of all information towards a single, universal truth. The power of this method is in its agnosticism, while at the same time it inhibits its own ability to distinguish great events from small, as it is just data. While the materialist is still within the structuring of the story of time, he must assemble the facts to create the conception of a final-hour, a time in which all things can be righted, and the prophecies fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where thinking seizes, only actions can fill the void to fulfill the prophecy. It is in these moment that have been vanquished again, and again by the powers that be that are charged with the same conditions for The Chosen One to always be able to enter The Gates. It is through stringing all of these events together, showing how they will happen over and over again, being repeated infinitely until the Messiah come; is that which affords the opportunity to explode this epoch and finally close the door of the law from the city of men, once and for all.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>18.</p><p>“In relation to the history of organic life on Earth,” notes a recent biologist, “the miserable fifty millennia of homo sapiens represents something like the last two seconds of a twenty-four hour day. The entire history of civilized humanity would, on this scale, take up only one fifth of the last second of the last hour.” The here-and-now, which as the model of messianic time summarizes the entire history of humanity into a monstrous abbreviation, coincides to a hair with the figure, which the history of humanity makes in the universe.</p></blockquote>



<p>It is by no mistake that Man is the most powerful he has ever been, and that it coincides with the most abhorrent travesties and barbarism beyond anything that could have ever been imagined before the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is something that we all know in our heart of hearts: that things could have been different. That we could live not only without hunger or fear, but freely with Libertas and Joy. And yet, at the same time — and all over the world — the social apparatus has become so hardened that what lies before us as a means of possible fulfillment presents itself as radically impossible.</p>



<p>It is only once we totally abandon the known forms of life and politics, and seek within ourselves the secret that the existence of another form-of-life could be true, that we will open the possibility of the Coming Community and the possibility of a kingdom of heaven on this earth in our life time.&nbsp;</p>







<blockquote><p>Addendum:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>A.</p><p>Historicism contents itself with establishing a causal nexus of various moments of history. But no state of affairs is, as a cause, already a historical one. It becomes this, posthumously, through eventualities which may be separated from it by millennia. The historian who starts from this, ceases to permit the consequences of eventualities to run through the fingers like the beads of a rosary. He records [erfasst] the constellation in which his own epoch comes into contact with that of an earlier one. He thereby establishes a concept of the present as that of the here-and-now, in which splinters of messianic time are shot through.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historicism is the facts of history as they are encrypted to their very being. However, the key is not lost. Through the posthumous keen observation towards the past, counting the events as rosary, with each one connecting itself to the greater constellation  of the immensity it contains, the focus of everything changes as the scrutiny intensifies. This coming into focus produces the real heros as they really were. Though vanquished and forgotten to their own, their story awaits the test of time, to be retold through the connection to our own here-and-now. Each event and the Truth it contains creates another star in our constellation which can lead the way through the dark night. With each star that is counted another bead is pasted in the rosary, the splintered shards of the mirror are gathered to reflect the same infinite image, offering themselves towards the summoning of the final moment of this time.</p>



<p>This is how we find our way out.</p>



<blockquote><p>B.</p><p>Surely the time of the soothsayers, who divined what lay hidden in the lap of the future, was experienced neither as homogenous nor as empty. Whoever keeps this in mind will perhaps have an idea of how past time was experienced as remembrance: namely, just the same way. It is well-known that the Jews were forbidden to look into the future. The Torah and the prayers instructed them, by contrast, in remembrance. This disenchanted those who fell prey to the future, who sought advice from the soothsayers. For that reason the future did not, however, turn into a homogenous and empty time for the Jews. For in it every second was the narrow gate, through which the Messiah could enter.</p></blockquote>



<p>What was time like before modernity and the regimented ticking of the clock? In no way did all time have its measurement, homogeneity, or distance — there would only be the memory, or longing of what had been. Holidays to remember, celebrations to be had, and moments of only life to be recounted. The morning differed from the evening, as much as day differed from night; time itself was the precious gem that was life itself. We only have one life which we can live, and we are still waiting with the gate of Law before us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gate is narrow, but it was made for only for our refusal, and only for Mahdi to close, and to welcome the Messiah into the home of the country, the private lives of our hearts.</p>

<p>This is the modified second half of a longer essay, The Sovereign, the Subject, and Crypto-power: Life in the Digital Panopticon.</p>







<p>Cryptography is first and foremost a technique of war.  </p>



<p>It is the final individual decision to protect one&#8217;s privacy and data beyond any laws, any violence, any war. </p>



<p>The history of computers is the history of cryptanalysis, which in turn is the history of the tactical development of communication under the conditions of total unbracketed war. Asymmetric cryptography is the culmination of the understanding of the phenomenon of “bellum omnium contra omnes” and offers a kind of science to which men can ‘protect themselves, when none else can protect them,’ and most importantly is solidified ‘by no covenant be relinquished.’ (Hobbes ¶ 21.21)</p>



<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of the personal struggle for life, liberty, and wealth against any and all governments that can only be called tyrannical. Bitcoin and the cryptography it entails offers every person a final kind of protection in the field of total unbracketed war where the term “bellum omnium contra omnes” offers its true decrypted meaning: each of us may become homo sacer at anytime for any reason. Nature opens the messianic path through the real state of emergency that is homo homini lupus and the infinite grotesque promise of what that should mean to each and every individual human today, and what Bitcoin offers as a response to it at each step. </p>



<p>Cryptography is the culmination of a cognition of history which recognizes the absolute value and totalizing nature of privacy in the theater of total war of all against all, and the respective role that privity takes in a field of total unbracketed war. In all systems of government, the possibility of a ‘state of emergency [ausnahmezustand]’ that will always create a &#8216;just war [jus bellum justum]&#8217; against ‘other [homo sacer]’ people who can be killed but not sacrificed, exploited but not robbed, and in bondage but not slaves; can always happen, and already is happening. This is a real possibility under any system of law, and is a hideous fact of the legal genocides, ethnic cleansing, and political expropriations of the 20th century. Crypto is a history which understands the infinite violence that all sovereign powers have entitled themselves to for ‘final solution’ of legal means against man, nature, and life as we know it at all cost — including the rule of law itself. </p>



<p>It is once we understand that our political problems are first economic problems that our position in the struggle against global panoptic fascism will vastly improve. It is through this understanding that we will find the only path towards our exit and the freedom that is intended for only us. </p>



The Final Decision of Cryptography



<blockquote><p>“The sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” </p><cite>— Carl Schmitt</cite></blockquote>



<p>Crypto commands the code alone to be sovereign.</p>



<p>There is no exception to this. There are no laws that can change this fact, nor any amount of violence that can modify it either. </p>



<p>Due to this explicit fact that digital expressions exist solely in the realm of  non-physical space through mathematical expression alone, it can never be subjugated to the same physical forces that legal and authoritarian rule must always entail. Crypto leaves no remainder for any kind of exception.</p>



<p>Crypto is subject only to the laws of mathematics alone&#8211;NOT men, institutions, or governments. </p>



<p>If you think otherwise then come and break it!</p>



<p>There is no sovereign exception, nor can there be one. The vicious magnanimity and imperium to which cryptography holds mathematics as its only sacrosant allows for it to consecrate the glory of a singular Spinozian God [Deus sive Natura] to whom there are no exceptions within his machine of mathematics, his immanent laws of the universe, and His passion for a form of common-wealth that is beyond the power of any group of men. Bitcoin is the resounding thunder of an idea whose time has come, and that cannot be stopped.</p>



<blockquote><p>What we need, however, is a political philosophy that isn’t erected around the problem of sovereignty, nor therefore around the problems of law and prohibition. We need to cut off the King’s head: in political theory that has still to be done.</p><cite>&#8211;Foucault, Truth and Power</cite></blockquote>



<p>Crypto presents a political theory which decapitates the sovereign&#8217;s head with the resounding declaration of fiat justitia, et pereat mundus [Let justice be done lest the world perish]. </p>



<p>Crypto does this by not engaging the the classic stratagem of law, prohibition, and sovereignty that all law demands; but something totally novel and new. Crypto engages in a radically new system of common-wealth and digital social contract by using cryptography as the base technique of this new form of organization. Through this a new political form-of-life, where all people can have their wealth be protected from any form of violence through the power of cryptography; a messianic possibility is opened. The crisis of money becomes apocalyptic, and an existential threat to all nation-states today. It is the final emergency that cannot be stopped, and opens humanity to the final epoch where man may take his final dignified place as the ruler of himself, by himself, for himself alone. </p>



<p>This allows for something that all people, everywhere, whether they admit it or not, know in their heart of hearts: that things could be different, that radical economic, social, and political change is a real possibility. We could live not only without hunger, but also probably without fear, and freely as well. And yet, at the same time — and all over the world — the social apparatus has become so hardened and calcified that what lies before us as a means of possible fulfillment presents itself as radically impossible.</p>



<p>Together we must choose to make the collective decision to create the real and final state of emergency that will be the final existential threat to the state and their fiat money. By refusing their corrupt money, hollow laws, and false idols we can make the world new again. Together we can choose to create a new form of social life, common-wealth, and legal system together that is outside and beyond the power of any state or government to destroy&#8211;only for them to submit to. </p>



<p>We can choose to create the foundation for a totally new form of political, social, and economic life that is the commonwealth and new social agreement for our time. With the power of cryptography we can guarantee the privacy, freedom, and liberty that was promised to only us; and that we intend to keep! No fascist decrees, no communist appropriations, no state of emergency from any political banner can stop us! The struggle is real and we will not stop until fiat money is destroyed and the state and money are totally separated as they should to be. </p>



<p>Together we can deactivate fiat money, state law, and shatter the paradise of legal violence and authoritarianism in order to consummate a new form of economic, social, and political life. A life that is beyond the power of any state to destroy, any laws to litigate, and any violence to violated. The state will try to destroy it, and with each blow that they will deliver, crypto will only get stronger. It will prove its inviolable nature more resoundingly, blow by blow, while also showing just how corrupt, wicked, and evil those in positions of legal and state power really are. </p>



<blockquote><p>The sovereign is the point of indistinction between violence and law, the threshold on which violence passes over into law and law passes over into violence.</p><cite>— Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer</cite></blockquote>



<p>Through a glitch in the matrix that creates the image of sovereign power through its physical form; we also find the Achilles’ heel from which there is an opening to create Leviathan’s downfall. Leviathan must always have a physical foothold from where he can display his power, a body to which make an example of his sovereign violence. </p>



<p>However, sovereign power cannot actualize the law if it does not have a physical space to render violence within. It needs a physical body it can identify first, so it may subject, dehumanize and objectify in order to display its legal and physical power. If legal power cannot find a physical body or space in which it can carry out it punishment, it risks displaying the incapacity of the law without violence, the sovereign without his subject, the emperor without clothes.</p>



<p>The secret is that the sovereign is as blind as the rest of us if it cannot see. </p>



Blinding the Sovereign 



<blockquote><p>The State is superstructural in relation to a whole series of power networks, that invest the body, sexuality, the family, kinship, knowledge, technology and so forth. True, these networks stand in a conditioning-conditioned relationship to a kind of ‘meta-power’ which is structured essentially round a certain number of great prohibition functions; but this meta-power with its prohibitions can only take hold and secure its footing where it is rooted in a whole series of multiple and indefinite power relations that supply the necessary basis for the great negative forms of power.&nbsp;</p><cite>&#8211;Foucault, Truth and Power</cite></blockquote>



<p>In order for legal power to secure a footing, the first engagement of power must be one of identification. Through identification, the physical form can be found, and power projected on to the subject in any of the nearly infinite techniques the panopticon can use to project the gaze and its power on the subject. Once identified, the process of selection can begin. The subject can then be labeled as ‘friend’ for inclusion in the camps, or &#8216;enemy&#8217; for isolation, destruction, and liquidation. However, through the digital, which can only and explicitly be expressed in non-physical medium, there is a territory in which the subject can abscond into a total anonymous existence of its own creating. In making the final turn away from the panoptic machine, and giving oneself entirely as anonymous citizen of the digital cosmos, man once again finds the ideals from which he can create the new order of the ages once again.</p>



<p>Through using cryptography to create a novel and fair economic game of wealth common to all, bitcoin rediscovered the sovereign power that is hidden at the center of what a commonwealth really is: The commonality of wealth to all, with no one able to control or change the system for the betterment of some at the cost of others. In other words, it is commonality of law itself, for the system to recognize each of us equally. The capacity and demand for law to remain totally neutral, and blind through the anonymous functions of cryptography ensures complete and open access for everyone. No matter one&#8217;s station of birth, creed of faith, or political identity according to the state; Bitcoin can give you equal access to this new law that is defined by its blockchain. </p>



<p>With this radical new power of peace, man finds himself back at the start of all political concept once again. However, this time man emerges from the forest of technology armed with the final weapon of cryptography and the mask of anonymity of which hides the face of the messianic possibility it contains. Man has renewed the opportunity to liberate himself from the concentration camps of modernity; but this time for good, permanently, and forever.  By using the power of cryptography to banish information from identify, controlling, and subjecting us; we create the new nomos for humanity. </p>



<p>Through bonding our political destinies with with the science of cryptographic protocols and consummating with the machine directly; we can create a new form of common-wealth, law, and power. It is the commonwealth of crypto which will open the next and final epoch for all of humanity and posterity, and what the promise of a money freed from the vestiges of statism, debt, and fiat money looks like. Through the personal choice to totally objectify oneself via code, and giving oneself to it entirely for the protection that it offers when no other sovereign can; the commonwealth of cryptography open the polis to man once again. </p>



<p>Through giving ourselves over to the power of cryptography and the majesty and imperium to which it will always hodl; we find the power to create a real form polis through the encrypted internet. Here we have found the power to open the final hour in which state legal power can be deactivated, and all people may be free from it for good. Peace on this earth is not such a radical ideal if we all have the power/knowledge of cryptography at our fingertips, and how to use such a power to protect our lives, our wealth, our honor, our freedom, and our privacy. </p>



<p>Through accepting crypto as a political cause and sovereign power, any human may free and liberate their wealth, privacy, and liberty from the state and fiat slavery once again. With the true nature of what the common-wealth of law rediscovered, magnus ab integro seclorum nascitur ordo (the great series of ages begins anew). </p>



<p>It is the political and theological destiny of all of humanity in the final hour, the final emergency, for all legal systems to shipwreck themselves on the reef of ethics which no decision can avoid. Each ship designed with the same flaw of the rudder of sovereignty; each one damned to the same mutinied destination no matter the pitch, speed, or weight. We are each free to abandon the ship of the camps now, free to swim back to the country from which we came, where we will no longer be before the law. </p>

  &#8220;What does it matter who is speaking,&#8221; someone said, &#8220;what matters is who is speaking.&#8221;



<p>That’s the entire point.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a totally new concept was developed where scientific texts were accepted on their own merits and positioned within an anonymous and coherent conceptual system of established truths and methods of verification. Authentication no<br> longer required reference to the individual who had produced them;<br> the role of the author disappeared as an index of truthfulness and,<br> where it remained as an inventor&#8217;s name, it was merely to denote a<br> specific theorem or proposition, a strange effect, a property, a body, a<br> group of elements, or pathological syndrome.</p><cite>Michel Foucault, What is an Author? [bold mine]</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Spectre that Satoshi Nakamoto represents — a single human being intransigently choosing the protection of cryptography against a seemingly omnipotent global government machine hell-bent on controlling all wealth, information, and identity no matter what — is a far greater power than any money he created; but is the very legend that he and Bitcoin is. Through creating a character that we only know as this amorphous, pseudonymous, nonphysical &#8216;person&#8217;&#8211;the idea that is Satoshi Nakamoto&#8211;and his great work that he introduced into the world&#8211;Bitcoin&#8211;Satoshi was really telling a much greater story about wealth, identity, and power in the arc of human history. When one reads all the details of this hidden story about a man and his passion for a new form of wealth that is beyond any temporal power; we discover the tale of cryptosovereignty and the extraordinary individual power that is cryptography, and Bitcoin in this world. </p>



<p>As time builds between Satoshi&#8217;s last appearance in our world and the inoperetivity that is his task of Bitcoin; so too will the legend of who he is, and the ramification of what he has done. And as this legend grows and becomes known by all of humankind, it will transmogrify beyond just a legend and into the fabric of history itself. As the very foundation of fiat money and panoptic surveillance comes to tremble before the name Satoshi Nakamoto, the reality of his task will be too palpable for anyone to deny. </p>



<p>With each ludicrous attempt to identify Satoshi, as we saw with Dorian, or  the fraudulent, lying, despicable sack of shit that is CSW, or any of those other fuck-ups who have tried to claim to be him; the legend of Satoshi will only grow stronger. Now only a cryptographic signature from the genesis block will suffice to verify that Satoshi is who he is. Anything short of that will always leave space for it to be questioned, for Satoshi to remain hidden. I believe in all of his brilliance and glory Satoshi threw those private keys into the abyss, sealing his fate as the author of the greatest work of art that has ever been created; while dooming his project to the final, inevitable conclusion that it and the world must come to. </p>



<p>For the deepest truth of what Satoshi had to teach us was &#8216;what does it matter who is speaking, someone said, what matters is who is speaking.&#8216; </p>



<p>Through the glory, grace, and dignity of whoever Satoshi Nakamoto may be, the one thing that is for certain is they are of the greatest character and class of any human that there has been. And it is not for the achievement that is Bitcoin, the extraordinary power that is unlocking this new epoch, nor even for the monumental amount of exogenesis wealth it will create; but for his very human choice to walk away. </p>



<p>Through this action alone Satoshi may very well pass himself from being just a legend to something so much more extraordinary and audacious: </p>



<p>Hope.</p>



<p>Real hope. </p>



<p>For something new. For something different. For something fair. </p>



<p>By refusing to reveal who he is, refusing to expose his wealth, and by making the final decision to remain as only the author of Bitcoin, and nothing more; he has moved himself from the human realm into that of the Elysium itself. </p>



<p>By maintaining his image as a Being that is beyond this place of wrath and tears, past the gridding and guilt that is now our very physical faces and existence, and past the shame and injustice that is the history of all fiat money; Satoshi&#8217;s work has opened the narrow path from which we can escape the camps of modren life. Just as in the darkest of nights does the smallest of lights shine the brightest, so too does Bitcoin present itself here on this earth today. </p>



<p>The creation of Bitcoin was a task chosen for only him/them/it alone, and the role was played perfectly to the task. Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto may be, they are clearly the greatest hero of the 21st century, and quite possibility even the great liberator of humanity itself. Only time will tell how great and how vast the legend of Satoshi Nakamoto will grow to be, and how glorious his project of Bitcoin will become; but one thing is for certain and that is this:</p>



<p>Satoshi has given us hope. </p>



<p>By refusing the greatest sum of money that any person has ever created, by keeping his face concealed and beyond the power of any state or person to identify, and by choosing to walk away from one of the most extraordinary project that humanity has ever known; Satoshi has proven his imperium and sovereignty through cryptography.  Through his being as an author alone, he has displayed the power that any of us can have access to when we choose to use the power of cryptography to protect ourselves, and the promise that will always entail. Through his task of Bitcoin and the Good News that it is, he has given each one of us the gift for to choose for ourselves what the real meaning of value, wealth, and law is. </p>



<p>In this final action of walking away, and taking his death upon himself, Satoshi closed the Gate of Law as his final move and checkmate to forbid any state from interloping in our land, and allow us an opportunity to abscond back to the country from which we came so we may be free once again. </p>







<p>Epilogue:</p>



<p>It is said that after Satoshi stopped working on Bitcoin that he found a job as a scrivener lost somewhere down on Wall Street. Today he still sits there, as Bartleby once did, confounding financiers, economist, lawyers, and all sorts of reasonable men alike with his intransigency, and decision to refuse to go along with anything. It is said that he was a most unreasonable man and his only response to any question was:</p>



&#8220;I would prefer not to.&#8221;







<blockquote><p>“If Bartleby is a new Messiah, he comes not, like Jesus, to redeem what was, but to save what was not. The Tartarus into which Bartleby, the new savior, descends is the deepest level of the Palace of Destinies, that whose sight Leibniz cannot tolerate, the world in which nothing is compossible with anything else, where &#8220;nothing exists rather than something.”</p><cite>― Giorgio Agamben</cite></blockquote>

  How Anarchism Without Adjectives Can Point Towards a Method of Unifying&nbsp;Crypto



<p>Anarchism without adjectives was a form of anarchism developed in the late 19th century a few decades after anarchism split with communism in 1872 over authoritarianism and the use of the state in creating a stateless  society. While anarchist were unified in their idea of a stateless society and the need to create it without the state, there was no consensus on how this was to be done, so a number schisms developed within anarchist movement itself. From individualist anarchist, to anarcho-syndicalist and anarcho-communist, there were many different flavors of what a stateless society could look like under the banners of anarchism. In response to the petty narcissism of small differences between various anarchists, anarchism without adjectives rejected specific forms of anarchism for a synthesis of operable praxis. It wanted to focus on what worked, rather than the ideology of what they thought would work. </p>



<p>The great advantage of this strategy is it creates a revolutionary front through the praxis of revolutionism first. It synthesizes all revolutionary tendencies, solidifying them into a primacy of solidarity around the organization of the revolutionary struggle itself. This is how the I.W.W. one of the largest and most revolutionary unions to ever be created functioned was through a synthesis of many revolutionary traditions under the umbrella of &#8216;one big union.&#8217;</p>



<p>Drawing from the history that allowed for anarchist to create such a revolutionary movement that was able to threaten the very foundation of the state, we can again create such an organization through unify crypto under a similar banner. Through the creation of one big union people realized that rights were not something that were meant to be protected by the state, but were something that people must defend for themselves together. Through the tradition of &#8216;An injury to one is a concern of all,&#8217; crypto renews this same revolutionary struggle into the digital age, with concern to the digital rights of all. </p>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto gave us a form of money that the state can never control. We need to take this seriously if we are to use this form of money, and everything that has come after it as part of our arsenal in the secret war that is taking place to free humanity from the shackles of fiat money and the state&#8217;s totalitarian economic control. We need allies if we are going to win in our various struggles against whatever masters may have claimed us for themselves. Through taking this idea of anarchism without adjectives and applying it to crypto, we can find a new form of synthesis; or syndicalism, that can help weave our revolutionary movement together.</p>



Crypto without Criticism, but Critiques



<p>Now I want to be clear, crypto without criticism should not mean crypto without critiques, nor should it mean that we accept fungable tokens, stablecoins, or other shitcoins that are really panoptic statist ledgers, and not crypto at all. What this strategy acknowledges is that bitcoin, while being revolutionary in its own right, and containing the messianic potential to end law and destroy the Westphalian state as we know it; there is still a great possibility that it could fail, or even worse, be seditiously compromised. Every one of us must be vigilant, thoughtful, and apply adversarial thinking to each step of our process in order to ensure that the revolutionary nature at the center of what is being done is never compromised.&nbsp;By very nature of what crypto is, we cannot have any single point of failure, which is why we must be open to other projects and the potential merits (or failings) they may offer.</p>



<p>Bitcoin unequivocally is one of the greatest invention of humanity. There is no question that what Satoshi Nakamoto created has radically changing the world, and has opened a new horizon for human freedom and action. It is even quite possible that bitcoin is messianic, and that Satoshi is the prophet of a novus ordo seclorum that will liberate us from the old law, and allow for us to enable something totally new in its place&#8211;but only time will tell. While I zealously have given myself to the cause, and believe Bitcoin to be the most revolutionary vehicle that we have, I still cannot call myself a maximalist (majoritist maybe).</p>



<p>We must be open to the possible that Satoshi is a statist, that a deep reorg 51% attack will happen, the core devs are all somehow compromised, or there is something fundamentally broken in the bitcoin code. We must be open to the worst possibilities in order to create redundancy, to build our ranks, and educate people about the possibility of freedom from fiat, however that may come. Only through creating a robust collective movement that is focused on building and using the revolutionary technology of crypto without anyone&#8217;s permission for whatever purpose it may be, will be able to create the revolutionary movement that can finally win the freedom and liberty to which we are entitled. </p>



<p>The political objective of what crypto is, how it functions, and why it creates power is of the utmost importance and we must ensure that the technologies of the future really are &#8216;crypto&#8217; and not something else. As I warned in the poverty of tokens, there is a real risk of creation a panoptic nightmare of unparalleled proportions if we run the risk of deploying broken &#8216;crypto&#8217; that isn&#8217;t crypto at all. </p>



<p>Through the tradition of anarchism without adjectives, we can create a movement for crypto without criticism. A movement which can be ideologically committed to the values that represent crypto, while also offering valid critiques of each crypto projects and their weaknesses. It is only though such intellectual exchange, inquiry, and explanation will we be able to understand one another, and create a space in which we can work together.  </p>

  I humble offer the following homily as thanks to you and the glory to which you are creating through crypto.



♦Stéphane Mallarmé, <br>&#8220;A throw of the dice will never abolish chance!&#8220;<br>Apparently there are encrypted meaning in Mallarmé&#8217;s poetry, similar to Edgar Allen Poe







<p>Hello Friends, Brothers of Bitcoin, Sisters of Secrecy, Comrades of Crypto, and any Fiat Foreigner who will lend me their eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this, and for the glory to which you are building and hodling with me in this place we call crypto. Despite not knowing you in the world of Flesh and Steel, there is a hedl camaraderie and solidarity that we share that goes beyond our physical bodies, and into the new digital one we are creating. Together we are building a new commonwealth that cryptography has enabled and introduces a new form of wealth into this world. It is beyond the corruption and avarice that is fiat money and government power; and has the astounding concealed truth of Libertas as the secret its hodls at core. Together, we are seizing the means of safety and security for the commonality of our wealth that no sovereign power anywhere can guarantee any longer. Block by block, bit by bit, byte by byte, we validate this new world together, the minting of a new kind of friendship and hope; a new commonwealth of freedom for our time and beyond.</p>



<p>It is because of you, Friend, Majestic Other Invictus, s/he with 2²⁵⁶ hidden faces and beyond; it is you Private One, that makes all of this possible, and I want to thank you for just that.</p>



<p>Oh how I wish I could meet you face-to-face friend! As a peer-to-peer, just a sibling of flesh, a child of matter, but I understand why it must never be. It  is our providence that we will only know each other’s digital signatures and nothing more; the Other’s only True Name. For you and I are one-in-the-same, part of the same infinite fabric of homogeneity that is both the sign of the holiness of this digital noosphere that has been created, and also the seal of the sins of that which has been done in meatspace that compels us to meet at this Schilling point here. It is only here in this digital space beyond the wrath and tears of our physical bodies, that we can provably meet here together as equals with no identity other than the secret name from our heart of hearts, that only God can ever know. </p>



<p>It is only though your glory, that of the Anonymous Other, whose face-to-face that I will never see; that you show yourself for all your power and glory for what it really is. It is you who has shown me the path towards the port from which I will gain harbor, and it is for you whom I will always be a humble peer, a node in your constellation of freedom. You are the the Alice to my Bob, the lover who I will never really know, but with whom I must demand to commune with absolute, holy assured privacy; to glorify our mutual God hidden inside cryptography. I t is only with you, anonymous other, with whom I can consummation such a great system of power that is cryptography. You are always there to enable the nameless, faceless hero of a thousand hidden faces; who goes by the encrypted name messiah. You My Friend are the profit of such a system of power; the prophecy that can only be the new commonwealth of value for the coming messianic age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I thank you Ally for stripping yourself of your physical body, and known identities, and absconding into cyberspace, where you have becomes something so much greater than just a human body, but the glory of idea come to light! Here you are provable unique; hidden number, an expression so complex and unique, that we can provably say it shall never be again. It is here that God shows you his face, for only you to see, and just for that instant alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You My Friend are an idea whose time has come, and whose presence resounds and reverberates around the globe. You have created an opening here for us to change everything, and create the final epoch in which man is freed for good and forever. All of mankind can now go beyond the rapprochement of any guns, gavels, or gallows; to leave his wealth after this life only for the dignity of God alone, and the protection He will afford from beyond the grave. I thank you for understanding that Friend, and helping assure the holiness of this place through your sacred tasks, whatever they may be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is you nameless Other, the one who breathes life into the mathematical systems of game theory, secret communicate under duress, and fulfills everything that is the prophecy of what crypto really means, it is you who I must thank. It is only from the glory of your hidden face, your concealed, namelessness being, and Otherness in lacking of any identifying forms, that you are able to show your messianic power in all of its spectacular grandeur and majesty.&nbsp;Thank you Friend, thank you for abandoning the temporal world of flesh and steel to created a new digital body that is beyond the flesh of any meager physical body, and into scales of unconquerable encrypted armor which will will use to protect all of our future wealth. </p>



<p>Here, in this sacred space, where we are no longer tethered to the limits of our physical bodies and forms, we can reach beyond ourselves and explode into being the promise of what cryptography offers to us! We can allow for our actions in the digital space to go beyond just our singular physical selves, and bond into the ethos of time and the story of humanity itself to become something more, something greater, something that is destined to be. You My Friend understand what it means to have a form of wealth that is beyond the wrath of any fist, the cudgel of any pig, and the curse of any man. As Foucault taught us, “What does it matter who is speaking?” you said, and you really meant it. </p>



<p>It’s been quite the journey, hasn’t it? Can you believe its more than a half-million blocks, almost 3/5 of a million today! What can we say, when its been hashing like this, time seems to just speed up a few bits. It is only from this block in the timechain of our history that we can see the political history that got us here. Block by block, compiling the stairway to our paradise of liberated wealth free from the bondage of Old Law and Time, it is you who are the one who leads us in the conquest for the freedom of wealth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phantasmagoria and psychedelic; together  we are tripping into the renewing the ἀγάπη (Agape) that this technology promises, and will deliver. Crypto has at its base a theology of non-violent counter-economic exchange that any person, anywhere can use; regardless of their stature or citizenship, and is free for the taking of anyone who wants to participate. It is the fulfillment of what anarchism means, and its implementation in this world. I thank you my Friend for your belief, conviction, faith, fortitude, and zeal in this crazy fantasy that we are demanding becomes a reality, and insisting on creating. You understand that there is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come.</p>



<p>And the Time has arrived.</p>



<p>On that day, when you found God, and understood for the first time His incredible hidden secret glory that is veiled at the center of cryptography and what that promise means; you understood that there really was a power that is infinite, everlasting, and will go on, and on unto the end of time. It is this immanent power that has always existed in mathematics of God, His universe, and the mystery that this physical place will always hodl that creates the power of crypto and all that goes into it. Here a spinozian god unveils himself in all of his majesty and glory to show he still commands all in this world through his secret ways, encrypted meanings, and steganography ways. It is from this deepest intellectual space and place, where the idea of true value has been meditated upon in the bosom of God, does He show the secrets of His power and His Glory only for the worthy to value.</p>



<p>You understand that God has shown us here, a form of wealth common to all which abolishes the horrors, ignorance, and violence found in the physical realm of flesh and steel, and the failure of all contemporary law. Here a new territory of freedom has opened, giving us all the opportunity to colonize this new political space as our commonwealth, as the House of our wealth for ourselves and for all of future generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the digital space He has allowed for the total banishment of all physical form while allowing for a pretty good privacy to protect our physical bodies; banishing violence from ever being able to taking hodl in this space. With the gift of cryptography, and the Good News of Bitcoin, He has allowed for us a method to bridge the gap between the digital noosphere and the physical realm. With Bitcoin we have actualized this economic gift from Him and all of the glory it entails, and the promise of what it means that it is real, it on this earth today, and there is eschatological consequence to that fact.</p>



<p>Through the power of cryptography, we will create a new commonwealth for all of humanity, where we are given the protection of a new kind of law which is held totally in common, and which no man, person, or institution could ever be above, and any one of us will be able to directly verify.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My Friend, I cannot thank you enough for how you have taught me, with your wise code, concealed words, and steganographic ways. You have give me all of the crypto-power that I will need for this journey, and beyond it as well. It is your bravado, courage, and bombaste against this economic, political, ethical, and social system of totalitarianism and tyranny that gives me the strength and nourishment to continue fighting. I know in my deepest and most secret of hearts that we will prevail, and the relationship between state and money will be destroyed once and for all; and it is you who will do that.</p>



<p>I thank you my friend, my ally, my comrade, my sibling for all that you have given, and all that you will give in the coming battles over economics, money, and the idea of what value itself is. I am honored to know you will always be just beyond the screen, and available to be of service for our great cause, and I am infinitely indebted to your service for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thank you my friend Satoshi, thank you.&nbsp;</p>

  A very short etymology of the semantic hell that is ‘crypto’



♦Kairos — the personification of opportunity, luck and favorable moments. Also presented as a favorable opportunity opposing the fate of Man.







<p>The term crypto has a complex and deep history that reaches much father back then the recent development of the science of cryptography. The written word itself goes back for at least two and a half millennia, though its existence has been much longer. Through the use and abuse of the word over this time, crypto has shrouded and concealed its meaning to all except for the most astute observers.</p>



<p>Personally I am the most guilty of this robbery of language; having continued the legacy of bankrupting the term, widely referring to everything in the crypto-currencies ecosystem, asset, token, DeFi, DLT, etc. as simply ‘crypto’. Why? Because I love that it further encrypts the meaning of the word itself, leaving it deeper in obscurity. This leaves the individual to wrestle with the question of what ‘crypto’ really means, and if they are to try to decipher it; or allow for its true name to remain hidden to them.</p>



<p>Either way, in the words of Satoshi Nakamoto,</p>



<blockquote><p>“If you don’t believe me or don’t get it, I don’t have time to try to convince you, sorry.”</p></blockquote>



<p>However, I’ll take a shot at trying to convince some folks because I believe this technology is messianic, and all seekers should have an opportunity to discover the truth. To understand what crypto is, and to take it seriously; there must be a deep hermeneutical process that is undertaken to allow for a sincere engagement of what crypto-graphy means in order to allow for a new form of value-ability to come into view. The real ontological discovery that lies hidden at the core of this technique of power goes beyond any law, and allows for any person to use this power to protect them when nothing else can.</p>







The origins of ‘crypto’



<p>Coming from the ancient greek word&nbsp;κρυπτός&nbsp;(krúptō), roughly meaning, ‘I conceal’, crypto in the last century has been generally understood as being a prefix for a concealed political motive such as a crypto-facist, or crypto-communist. However, it also is a prefix for ‘of relating to cryptography’, such as crypto-suite or crypto-currency. The linguistic obfuscation here is of particular interest to us, because it allows for a much more&nbsp;radical form of power to lay hidden at the center of ‘crypto-assets’&nbsp;through its encrypted meaning.</p>



<p>What is particular about bitcoin, and crypto-currencies in general, is that they have given rise to a new kind of political character: crypto-anarchists. Crypto-anarchists are not of the same linguistic character that ‘crypto-facist’ or ‘cryptography’. Crypto in crypto-anarchy is referring to using cryptography as the base tool for organizing an anarchist (i.e. no laws) society. Crypto-anarchism is not attempting to the concealment of its objectives of creating anarchism; at least not initially. And to be clear, I’m not speaking of the childish ‘destroy &amp; enjoy’ kind of false anarchism portrayed in the media, but that of the linage of&nbsp;Prodhorn,&nbsp;Bakuin,&nbsp;Goldman,&nbsp;Rocker, and so many others. Anarchism is the radical freedom of individuals through the decentralization and the diffusion of power through various non-state organizations. Through the total empowerment of individuals against the state, anarchism is the third way between communism and fascism that we must demand, and is our only hope for a future free against tyranny, despotism, and panopticism we live under today.</p>



The concealment of crypto



<p>Tim May knew of this linguistic pun when he coined the term crypto-anarchist, and had the following to say about it:</p>



<blockquote><p>I devised the term crypto anarchy as a pun on crypto, meaning “hidden,” on the use of “crypto” in combination with political views (as in Gore Vidal’s famous charge to William F. Buckley: “You’re crypto fascist!”) and of course because the technology of crypto makes this form of anarchy possible. The first presentation of this term was in a 1988 “Manifesto,” whimsically patterned after another famous Crypto Anarchy and Virtual Communities manifesto. Perhaps a more popularly understandable term, such as “cyber liberty,” might have some advantages, but crypto anarchy has its own charm, I think.</p></blockquote>



<p>Charming indeed. However, because of the semantic hell that is crypto (as in the crypto-currency ecosystem), the very meaning of what crypto-anarchy is has transmuted it into something not well-understood by most involved in the field of crypto-currencies. Over the last thirty years we have lost the key to this scripture which has created the nonsense vacancy of the term ‘crypto’ as we see it today. The metaphysical meaning of crypto has encrypted its meaning to shitcoiners, nocoiners and everyone in between for greedy, high-time preference bullshit tokens that are devoid of real value or wealth.</p>



<p>Funny enough, these are the very people who are crypto-anarchist in the deepest sense of the word. They help propel this ecosystem deep into the heart of financial Troy, sincerely believing the gigantic horse of blockchain was a gift from the Gods.</p>



<p>And it is. They just don’t realize that crypto is a gift from the New Gods, not the old ones.</p>



<p>They don’t understand that this technology uses cryptography&nbsp;as a tactic&nbsp;to organize people on anarchist lines, using cryptography to directly shield the bodies of any one involved. They simply see ‘blockchain’ (a semantic hell in its own right) as another iteration of state power — of finding new laws, and ‘better’ regulation with more panoptic violations. They lack the fundamental understanding of why the explosive power of cryptography is at the heart of these systems. They lack the understand that cryptography’s fundamental objective is to protect one from&nbsp;ANY&nbsp;advisory at any cost — including all law, militaries, and tax agencies. They fail to see that the fixed supply cap of bitcoin, the proof-of-work scheme, and pseudo-anonymity are not technical issues, but political ones.</p>



<p>Adversarial thinking is inherently anarchist, and cryptography has always bared the signature of this at its heart. This is why cryptography has always been a military tactic first, as it has always existed outside of the bounds of law, and existed in only the field of war long before the word cryptography was even produced.</p>



<p>It is important to remember that anarchism has always influenced and served the original ideas of those who would later become the cypherpunks. Chaum’s 1985 paper&nbsp;Security Without Identity: Transaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete&nbsp;points directly to this. It was one of the first papers that understood and connected governmental control of money with the security state, and how the technology of encryption could make big brother obsolete.</p>



<p>Later in 1992, Tim May distilled these values into the ‘Crypto-anarchist Manifesto’, which opens with the following:</p>



<blockquote><p>A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy. Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the true name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive rerouting of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.</p></blockquote>



<p>Shortly after this was written, the first of the&nbsp;Crypto Wars&nbsp;started and the struggle to break cryptography out of its militarized cage was initiated. Through the valiant and heroic efforts of these great men (of whom, many are still contributing today), and their personal direct struggle against agents of the state, they managed to expropriated the greatest and most powerful technology of defensive asymmetrical warfare in the history of mankind from the military-industrial complex and let it out into the world to complete its messianic task.</p>



The meaning of Crypto without the decryption key



<p>Flash forward 30 years, now ‘crypto’ has completely broken out of its militarized cage, and there is no power on earth which can stop it. However, with the spectacular number of ‘crypto’ projects out there, so much noise has been created that the meaning of crypto itself has been lost, and has encrypted the actual meaning of crypto to itself. The apex of this kind of insanity has to be the Facebook’s shitcoin Libera project. Those who are responsible for the most systematic violations of privacy that have ever been conceived or could even be imagined, now want to interlope into the economic realm under the idiotic guise of ‘crypto’ once again.</p>



<p>This is of the greatest ironies because while society may now have all of the radical tools that May theorized about 30 years ago to liberate ourselves from the camps of the state, we have been made blind to the real power that we have now have because of the semantic abyss we have fallen into. Our lack of class consciousness and the historical context that has got us here, has every blockchain bro proudly patting each other on the back, chained to their blocks of oppression in the darkness of Plato’s Cave.</p>



<p>As I warned in&nbsp;The Poverty of Tokens, crypto-assets can become a panoptic nightmares of privacy violations when blockchains becomes mutable, pre-mined, and non-anonymous. They no longer have any of the majesty, consanguinity, or consensuality of real crypto assets like Bitcoin; nor could they ever offer such assurances. Bitcoin can offer these kinds of assurances because it is not asking one to stake proof on trusting the system. Bitcoin demands that everyone check the work and not to trust, but to verify. Satoshi took the hermeneutics of value in the digital age very seriously, and Bitcoin is what was produced from that angst.</p>



<p>If we are to reclaim the term crypto from its inane semantic dribble (which I am not convinced we should — I think it is better this way), then we must have a deep understanding of the etymology of the word crypto, and how it has been used historically. Crypto has always been about the form of power which is now enshrined within the modren science of cryptography. It has always been about the capacity to conceal, and to hold secrets for oneself, and how such a secret generates power. It is the understanding that power resides within us directly, and no person, government, party, or institution may ever take that away from any of us. It is the knowledge/power that is anarchism and its final weapon of cryptography.  </p>



<p>Crypto is about the whole historical ark of the last 2,500 years in which this written term&nbsp;κρυπτός&nbsp;has been utilized as a tactic of self-protection&nbsp;through&nbsp;concealment alone. From steganography and the first shift ciphers of Cesar in ancient Rome, to the ciphers devised by Francis Bacon and Vigenère in the middle ages, to crypto’s premier as a full science with Kerckhoffs’s principle in&nbsp;La Cryptographie Militaire;&nbsp;crypto&nbsp;has always been about power!&nbsp;It is a form of power that is created through the concealment of information. It is only in the last century and a half that it has become an explicit material science lobotomized of its origins, purpose, and mysticism to serve only the state, and its great machines of death.</p>



<p>Crypto is about the power of privacy, and the form of power that is decrypted when the concealment of information is verified and guaranteed beyond the law of any and all men. But so long as ‘crypto’ remains a vacuous slogan used by every piece of shit blockchain thought up, crypto will continue to be a nascent term concealing its true meaning and its messianic potential.</p>

  ♦The Destruction of Leviathan



The messianic power hidden in bitcoin and how it can save the world



<blockquote><p>“All genuine political theories presuppose man to be evil.”</p><cite>— Carl Schmitt, On the Concept of the Political</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bitcoin is beyond revolutionary.</p>



<p>It is Messianic.</p>



<p>It is messianic for the very reason that it has done what no man, institution, political theory, or sovereign king could have ever accomplished with any form of law:</p>



<p>To create a truly free — as in freedom, and the liberty that must go with it — form of wealth that any human-being, anywhere in the world or beyond, no matter their station of birth, place of residence, creed, or color may use with no intermediary. Through the power and majesty of cryptography, Satoshi created a new economic, and thereby social and political commonwealth for the internet alone. Through imbuing economic value directly into the framework of the digital, Satoshi created a form of power that could reach beyond the violence of any physical power, including the state and its infinite violence. Through this destituent power (potenza destituente) bitcoin closes the door of law, and opens the messianic possibility of a humanity beyond any law through the theological power found hidden at the center of cryptography.</p>



<p>Through the theological conquest of fiat money and the coming obliteration of the state monetary system, bitcoin proves that it is a form of commonwealth that can replace law without violence. Bitcoin presents itself as the blade of Alexander the Great to the Gordian’s Knot of state and money. Bitcoin unapologetically severs the relationship between the two, uncompromisingly leaving nothing behind. Bitcoin is the final decision to destroy the relationship between the state and money, and the messianic promise that entails.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has the power to destroy the old, corrupt legal apparatus of state and fiat money that has enslaved every human on the planet; and to free every human for the great destiny that awaits us all. Bitcoin alone has initiated the final war against all fiat money for the freedom of the whole of humanity. Liberated from corrupt fiat money and the chains of debt that obligates and enslaves; bitcoin has induced a theological struggle over the meaning of wealth and value itself. Through forsaking the protection of the state, for the imperious sovereignty bitcoin has proven through cryptography, we find a new theological power which is the foundation of new kind of common law found through the digital.</p>



A commonwealth of cryptography



<p>Through the radical critique that is bitcoin is to all state fiat monetary systems, bitcoin has illuminated the path towards a way to completely disengages all legal and economic apparatuses of the state vis-a-via cryptography. It is a means of organization beyond any law through the theater of total unbracketed war. This is the history of crypto and the etymology of its praxis. This opens the spectacular possibility of a totally new form of human organization that is built on top of the guarantees of cryptography, the decentralized nature of such systems, and the personal power this technology entails. Bitcoin proves a form of human economic organization that is beyond the power of any form of violence or law, which is the very reason why cryptography is the engine that can be called messianic.</p>



<p>Bitcoin over the last ten years has create a single global movement that is loyal to no nation-state, no government, no military anywhere on the planet; but towards an ethics of a commonality of wealth. Through the radical protection cryptography offers to this new form of property found within bitcoin, the bonds of a new commonwealth have been formed.</p>



<p>The power found in this new commonwealth offers a kind of protection which no law anywhere can guarantee anymore. In our world where all law has been subsumed by the criminal and corrupt, and is openly prostituted by political pimps for the lowest insulting price, we know that there is nothing left to be said; just a system of exploitation to destroyed.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has opened the Pandora’s Box which contains the messianic possibility of a world freed from the corrupt law of the old and their blood-stained money. And this is all being done while introducing the order of the new that will replace the old forms of rule — a&nbsp;novus ordo seclorum. It is this seed of knowledge/power at the core of this technology that introduces a possible response to the totalitarian evil that is statism and its panoptic apparatus of total control: fiat money.</p>



<p>We must remember that it is foretold that the Messiah does not arrive as the redeemer, but as the subduer of the anti-christ. And with this technological Spear of Destiny we have been handed by Satoshi, the possibility of subduing the twin evils of the state legal apparatus and fiat money has appeared. Just in the brink of time as well, with the menacing shadow of the fascist panopticon machine and their all-seeing five-eyes growing in magnitudes and orders with each passing day. We are here to blind behemoth, to tear out its eyes with our spear and mutilate it beyond recognition in order let it be known, that our privacy was never for sale, and it will never be taken from us again.</p>



<p>Bitcoin has proven its steadfastness and piousness to its codebase, and its inability to violate its oath to its supply schedule or the functions of its system is its liturgical order. Bitcoin has proven its sovereignty through its code alone, and there is no exception to that. Through baring its sovereignty openly to the face of the world, bitcoin impels a new kind of theological faith found through cryptography and its capacity to conquer fiat money and the law behind it. This is a power which forsakes the protection of the state, for the proof the code can offer. It is a spiritual practice that does not ask for trust, but verification.</p>



The theological value of truth and fairness



<p>Bitcoin creates its economic value through the glory of the truth and fairness of its economic system. This value is of absolutely metaphysical nature because it calls into question the ontological being of man with his machines of law, technology, finance, the internet, and cryptography, from which he cannot escape. Through the power of cryptography pushing its way from the periphery of human experence only as technique of communications under total war, to one of the central organizational principals of humanity today, we must ask ourselves what does a cryptographic proof offer to man that he cannot offer to himself?</p>



<p>It is the oath to the commonalty of the law itself.</p>



<p>Over the entire concourse of the history of man, man has proven himself incapable of maintaining his oath to any law; while the machine has proven itself incapable of breaking its oath to its system of ordering, or code. Through replacing the ordering of the theological with that of the technological, we finally find ourselves back at the start of all things; the great order of the ages is born afresh — a&nbsp;novus ordo seclorum.</p>



<p>Through bitcoin’s total obligation to only its code alone, it has created a most fair and judicious system which demands that anyone who wants to bare the value of the system must prove the work of the system — there is no cheating allowed. Through the glory of bitcoin’s proof-of-work and the sacrifice of real electrical energy that is needed to continually verify its ledger, and secure its timechain, bitcoin executes a cryptographic liturgy which proves and guarantees itself through the code alone. And as the timechain of bitcoin grows and grows to verify its sovereignty again and again, proving its glory over and over as time grows on, more and more will come to accept the cryptographic theology that gives bitcoin its sovereignty.</p>



<p>Through proof-of-work bitcoin continually verifies its sovereignty from any government anywhere, and with each block that passes such facts become more resolute, resounding, and imperious. By its very nature and existence bitcoin opens up a totally new political topography in which people can use cryptographic systems to asymmetrically organize themselves against any enemy that is tens of powers stronger than they are.</p>



<p>Cryptography is the most revolutionary of tactics, for it seizes the means of communication and ensures the entirety of their secrecy; which can mean the difference between life and death, victory or vanquishment. It is when this tactic becomes not only the means of the revolution, the the production of it; the most spectacular transformation is created. A messianic object is created insofar that it goes beyond revolutionary and creates the possibility for the total elimination of law, while still assuring absolute personal protection of all individuals through cryptography. Through the solidarity of cryptography and the knowledge/power it endows us with, a new commonwealth is born.</p>



The theological glory of guaranteed wealth protection



<blockquote><p>“The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them. For the right men have by nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by no covenant be relinquished.”</p><p>-Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan</p></blockquote>



<p>All people everywhere have been violated by their respective sovereigns and are no longer offered any kind of power of protection by any government, but only the threat of withholding violence or death. Through the power of the new form of common-wealth found within bitcoin, we find the final cause for the most general kind of solidarity for all people everywhere: the total freedom of money, and its separation from any state anywhere. Here we find a new theological cause to which bond our lives, our honor, and most importantly, our wealth.</p>



<p>Only those that understand the majesty and glory of this cause, who believe with fervency and faith in what we are doing, and what we are creating, shall be rewarded in-kind for their hodling and faith in this future we are demanding. We understand that Bitcoin is a tool, a weapon of unparalleled consequence that arms the populous like nothing before and it is our means to building, achieving, and keeping our freedom. Through this tool alone, we can again find the ability to escape the totalitarian nightmare that is consuming humanity, and find the way to a new liberated world unlike anything imagined before.</p>



<p>Through the simple power of fixing bitcoin’s money supply in the past, and forcing the machines into an unbreakable oath for their own cause and glory, Satoshi glitched out the machine of power that is money, the false god that is state capitalism, and opened the messianic possibility of a world without law. In this shattering of the relationship between state and capital, the most spectacular power is created: a commonwealth of cryptographically proven value.</p>



<p>To separate the state from money, just as religion was separated from the state centuries ago; is to induce the final epoch where humanity can achieve the liberty that is intended only for it. It is the destiny of all of humanity to throw off the shackles of fiat money, and to walk into a radical new future where we seize the freedom and liberty intended only for us. To free wealth from the shackles of fiat money and the parasitic leviathan of the state is our holy war. We understand the barbarous relic that fiat money is, and we are impel towards a new theology which can save us from this evil through the power of cryptography and the redemption it offers. Bitcoin uses a theology of cryptography to prove its sovereignty, refusing the yoke of any authority except for the mathematical proofs of a Spinozian God alone.</p>



<p>Just as Martin Luther opened the schism from which the people could throw off the yoke of state religion, so too has Satoshi pointed us towards the path of liberation. He has given us hope in this world of avarice, vacuousness, and corruption, while creating the opportunity to create real commonality of wealth that is beyond the corruption of men, to become something so much greater. To create a better world through a more fair and just kind of money and economic organization is to create the opening from which the messianic prophecy can be fulfilled. Bitcoin is messianic for the very reason that it opens a path towards the practical refusal of all law through economic means alone.</p>



The one and only common-wealth of law



<blockquote><p>One day humanity will play with law just as children play with disused objects, not in order to restore them to their canonical use but to free them from it for good.</p><p>-Giorgio Agamben, State of Exception</p></blockquote>



<p>There is no more negotiations, pleading with the politicians, or hoping to convenience the statist of otherwise. This is a war over control of the control of wealth, who is entitled to create it, and how it should be monitored, controlled, issued, and tokenized. The present history of all states is a history of mass exploitation through fiat monetary systems, choking economic regulation, and total social liquidation. The state’s control of money is its ring of power to which it demands to see over ever facet of our lives, and every bitcoiner is here to destroy it.</p>



<p>In the anarchist tradition, Bitcoin screams with a thunderous crack;</p>



<p>‘No Gods, No Masters’</p>



<p>We refuse to capitulate our economic, social, and political power to the insane corruption and idiotic mission of such a society as this. We seek to destroy this disgusting system of exploitation, soulless consumerization, and free our friends and family from the camps that every state has setup around the whole of life. We will no longer allow for the false gods of any state, or their masters of fiat capital to tell us what is right and wrong, what is for our own good, safety, or otherwise. As Daniel Webster warned us nearly two centuries ago:</p>



<blockquote><p>“There are men, in all ages, who mean to exercise power usefully; but who mean to exercise it. They mean to govern well; but they mean to govern. They promise to be kind masters; but they mean to be masters.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The issuance, control, and monopolization of money to control the entirety of the wealth of the human race is nothing short of the final political objective of the evil of man, and the avarice that is his infinite vice for power. All the history of the world shows that power corrupts, and that such corruption will be found in any form of law no matter what. And with this, all law is torn asunder for the mighty weight of thirty pieces of silver.</p>



<p>When the authoritarianism that hides behind the law is allowed to control money itself; it will always use that power to enrich the small, elitist class of men who will control such money to the destruction of the whole commonwealth. The common-wealth of law has shipwrecked on the destitute shores of this Hell we call society because the commonality of wealth through fiat money, government restriction, and crony capitalism leaves us with only one thing left in common: It is not law, but tyranny.</p>



<p>To break the economic control of the state and their banking and financial allies is the most revolutionary action that is possible today, and it is through bitcoin that it can be achieved. There are thousands aimlessly hacking at the branches of evil, but there was one who choose to strike at the root directly: Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>



Ubermensch Satoshi Nakamoto



<p>Whoever he/she/they may be (except, of course, the fraudulent loser Craig Wright), Satoshi has proven himself to be the Ubermench of our time. Not for the incredible power and wealth he possesses, nor for the extraordinary genius and exquisite grace by which he was able to build, execute and deploy Bitcoin; but because of his choice to walk away.</p>



<p>By Satoshi choosing to keep their true name concealed, and allow for the code alone to accomplish the feat which no man of flesh and blood could do, is to fulfill the greatest task that could ever be done. By walking away, Satoshi fulfilled a power of economic, social, and political refusal; a destituent power which she alone has produced through her refusal of the greatest sum of wealth ever conceived.</p>



<p>In taking this action of refusal — refusing to accept fiat money, participate in the economic of corruption, or to be identified by the political apparatus of death — Satoshi proved it had a deep understanding of what value truly was as a metaphysical maxim. In the words of Schmitt, Satoshi understood that:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Value must continuously valuate, that is to say, it must bring its influence to bear: otherwise it dissolves into an empty manifestation. Whoever says value brings its influence to bear and has it enacted. Virtues are practiced, norms are applied, orders are executed, but values are set up and enacted. Whoever asserts a value, must bring its influence to bear. Whoever maintains that it has value regardless of the influence brought to bear by any individual human being who endorses it, is simply cheating.”</p><p>— Carl Schmitt,&nbsp;The Tyranny of Values</p></blockquote>



<p>By walking away from the machine of power that it created, Satoshi also closed the door of law from being able to come to our home of cyberspace, while creating the opening for a totally new form of politics to be enacted. Through this sacrifice and choice to walk away, Satoshi enacted a machine of political power and glory that no amount of violence can destroy, no amount of tyranny can control. The value of bitcoin is the creation of a new commonwealth of law governed by the open source code and the protocols which forms a kind of wealth beyond any state or government because of the cryptography at their core.</p>



<p>Through the cryptographic commonwealth that is governed entirely by the axioms of the code, and through the binary interpretation of the machine, man is finally allowed to bridge the abyss between positive law, and its implementation in this world through his anthropomorphic machine of technology. Through this technology man bares the real economic, social, political, and ultimately theological value of what it means to be truly free in this statist world. Cryptography creates an opening for the the messianic possibility of using this technology to save humanity from the impending horrors we all know are lurking just beyond the horizon.</p>



<p>Just as in all spheres God opposes myth, mythical violence (statism) is confronted by the divine. And the latter constitutes its antithesis in all respects. If mythical violence is lawmaking, divine violence is law-destroying; if the former sets boundaries, the latter boundlessly destroys them; if mythical violence brings at once guilt and retribution, divine power only expiates; if the former threatens, the latter strikes; if the former is bloody, the latter is lethal without spilling blood.</p>



<p>The here-and-now, which as the model of messianic time summarizes the entire history of humanity into a monstrous abbreviation, coincides to a hair with the figure, which the history of humanity makes in the universe. Through this messianic action of creating a form of wealth which no amount of violence, nor any form of state law could ever govern or control, Satoshi has opened the gate from which the figure may enter into the creation of the kingdom of heaven on this earth. It is through the conquest of money, and the global solidarity that bitcoin assures and guarantees through its new God of cryptography; we find the power to not create a new form of law, but to free us from all law for good.</p>

  <p>Not too long ago, the internet was a fringe phenomenon. Very few people
saw the benefits of a global communications network. Even fewer people
had the vision and the foresight to see what it might enable. Today,
most people take the internet for granted. It is simply expected to be
there, like running water in your home.</p>

<p>Even before the internet became ubiquitous, technologists and
visionaries realized the potential of this transformative technology.
They realized that an undiscriminating network combined with the magical
power of public-key cryptography tips the power-balance in the
individual’s favor.</p>

<p>Eavesdropping-resistant communication which can’t be stopped is poison
to authoritarian regimes, which, after all, are in the business of
suppressing and controlling the flow of information. If people are still
able to communicate and assemble, they can rise up and speak truth to
power. We saw the liberating potential of communications technology
during the Arab Spring, and we continue to see individuals rise up and
fight authoritarian rule today.</p>

<p>What the cypherpunks understood 30 years ago is starting to play out
right before our eyes: the tools of our information age have the
potential to empower individuals like never before.</p>



The Freedom to Transact

<p>As I am writing these lines, hundreds of thousands of people are
marching in the streets of Hong Kong, protesting against an extradition
bill proposed by the government. As always, protests like these shine a
light on the current power balance between individuals and the powers
that be.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the current system of surveillance, automated facial
recognition, and cashless transfers enables not only a single point of
failure, but also a single point of control in times of unrest. If the
government doesn’t like your opinion or the fact that you were part of a
(peaceful) protest, a simple truth becomes apparent: your freedom of
assembly was an illusion, as was your freedom to transact freely.</p>

<p>In a free society, these freedoms should be guaranteed. How? Well, as we have
seen in the past, information technology and strong cryptography — if used
carefully — guarantee the right to speak freely. After all, no amount of
violence will ever solve a math problem. In the same vein, an
information technology exists today which guarantees the right to transact
freely: Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It is easy to forget that “permissionless” and “censorship-resistant”
are more than mere buzzwords. Under difficult circumstances, these words
become a matter of life and death. The Hong Kong protests make evident
once again what privacy advocates have been preaching for years, even
decades: if censorship and surveillance are built into the system, it
will be used and abused by those who are in charge. And if you don’t
have the option to detach from your identity, free speech, free thought,
and free action are impossible.</p>

<p>What is true for WeChat, Facebook, and Google, is also true for our
current payment rails and the financial institutions of this world. No
matter how noble the motivation of building central controls into
communication or financial systems — power corrupts, and absolute
power corrupts absolutely, as the saying goes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Decentralized and private payments are a necessary innovation for a
digital future where we retain our civil liberties and personal
freedoms.”
<cite>Alex Gladstein</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Strong cryptography allows us to reclaim our right to private
conversations in the digital age, thanks to end-to-end encryption. The
same cryptography allows us to reclaim our right to transact freely in a
digital world, thanks to digital signatures, cryptographic hashes, and
the global machine of truth and freedom which is Bitcoin.</p>

The Freedom to Remain Private

<p>In today’s digital world — as Hong Kong protesters know — finding
out who went to which protest is as easy as retrieving data from a
database. Whether it is from people’s bank accounts, WeChat, Alipay, or
other virtual profiles, the convenience of the status quo inevitably
leads to a system of total surveillance, and thus total control.</p>

<p>The solution to this conundrum is enabling privacy by default, which has
been the default setting for thousands of years. Neither the internet
nor Bitcoin is perfect in this regards, which is why constant vigilance
and the development of privacy-enhancing technology are a necessity.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, efforts to encrypt all internet traffic by
default have been made. In the next couple of years, we hope to see
continued efforts being made to make every bitcoin transaction even more
private than they are now (which is one of the reasons why Bull Bitcoin
uses Wasabi’s CoinJoin by default).</p>

<p>As is evidenced by the long lines at Hong Kong’s train ticketing
machines, surveillance renders all other freedoms useless.</p>

<p>The current situation in Hong Kong paints a vivid picture of the
disastrous side-effects of a cashless society. Without a way to transact
privately and anonymously, people are enslaved to the masters of
finance. And no amount of going digitally dark will allow you to avoid
this slavery.</p>

<p>Arguably, things are bound to go from bad to worse. The financial elite
which controls the most important good of our society — money itself
— is playing god with our shared macroeconomic reality. In the last
couple of decades, a concerted effort was made to attack another
financial freedom: the freedom to save.</p>

The Freedom to Save

<p>Even without people marching in the streets, it is apparent to most that
these are chaotic times. Currencies are not holding their value. A
recession is looming. The most powerful men in the world are openly
fighting currency wars and are bragging about it on twitter. All while
the endless printing of money continues and politicians/bankers are
spewing propaganda to normalize negative interest rates.</p>

<p>People talk about Quantitative Easing (QE) and Negative Interest Rate
Policies (NIRPs) as if they were anything other than pure insanity. The
first is simply printing massive amounts of money, the second is paying
borrowers and stealing from savers.</p>

<p>Gone are the days where you would get interest from your money in the
bank. In the world of NIRPs, you have to pay the bank to hold your
money. In the same vein, gone are the days where you have to pay back
your loan plus a little extra to reimburse your lender for taking on the
risk. In the world of NIRPs, you are getting paid to take out a loan.
Need some money? No worries! We are giving you the money and are paying
you a little extra, for enjoying the privilege of giving you a loan!</p>

<p>As should be apparent for every child which is offered the choice
between two marshmallows today, or one marshmallow tomorrow: the current
financial world is defying common sense. I repeat: pure insanity.</p>

<p>More and more people realize that this insanity has to stop and decide
to exit a system in which a global negative-yielding debt of $15
trillion is the new normal. The broken financial system, with its
negative interest rates and “modern” monetary policies, are, in part,
responsible for the rise of sovereign individuals all over the world.</p>

<p>People begin to realize the stupidity of this game. Putting pressure on
this broken system by making a run on banks is one form of peaceful
protest. Storing your value in an asset which can not be inflated, can
not be confiscated, and can not be subject to the whim of politicians
and bankers is another one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sats are my safe haven.”
<cite>Matt Odell</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin is quickly becoming a safe haven asset, especially for people
who don’t have easy access to more “stable” currencies than their own.
On a long enough time scale, bitcoin offers stability in a world of
global instability. It guarantees the right to save: nobody will be
able to take away your sats — you must give them away willingly.</p>

Building towards a Sovereign Future

<p>People are fed up with the tyranny of the banks, the tyranny of the
state, the tyranny of Facebook, WeChat, Sina Weibo, and everything else
which is “too big to fail.”</p>

<p>It is our collective responsibility to build a better future. A future
where the freedom to transact, the freedom to remain private, and the
freedom to save your wealth over time are guaranteed. In the words of
the United Nations: the same rights and freedoms people have offline
must also be protected online.</p>

<p>We want to help build a world which enables sovereign individuals to
strive. A world where every individual — and every company, for that
matter — can use freedom-enabling technologies, as they see fit,
without asking anyone for permission. This is one of the reasons why we
have released cyphernode, a suite of software and utilities to operate
enterprise-grade Bitcoin services, as free software.</p>



  ♦


  Cyphernode - free as in freedom.



<p>While it is debatable whether Bitcoin can literally solve every problem
of the world, it is undoubtedly a big piece of the puzzle. Technologies
which empower the individual are more important than ever before.
Technologies which enable you to remain private, speak and transact
freely, or tip the balance of power towards the individual in another
way will be invaluable for the world we are heading towards.</p>

<p>China is giving us a taste of what living in a dystopian surveillance
state is like: you cross the street at the wrong place or the wrong
time, and thanks to facial recognition, a fine is automatically deducted
from your bank account while an algorithm adjusts your social credit
score downwards. You pay for a bus ticket to take part in a peaceful
protest, and you are at risk of being erased from the central registry,
effectively erasing your ability to live a normal life as a citizen. It
might happen today, it might happen tomorrow, or at any point in the
future. The surveillance state does not forget.</p>

<p>The tools to guarantee freedom for all exist today, they are just not
evenly distributed, not well understood, and not widely deployed.
However, with every passing day, more and more people are realizing what
kind of power is in their hands.</p>

<p>We encourage you to stay strong. We encourage you to keep on building.
We encourage you to not give in to tyranny. We, and many people like us,
will do our best to build towards a better future. Stay safe out there,
and don’t forget to buy bitcoin.</p>

  <p>The definition of life has been a challenge for scientists and
philosophers alike. While many definitions have been put forward, what
precisely differentiates the living from the non-living remains elusive.
Are viruses alive? DNA molecules? Computer viruses? Biologically
produced minerals?</p>

<p>Ralph Merkle, inventor of cryptographic hashing and namesake of the
Merkle tree, made the argument that Bitcoin is the first example of a
new form of life. In this article series, I intend to take this claim
seriously, explore it further, and see what can be gleaned from viewing
Bitcoin as a living organism.</p>

<p>The first part will establish that Bitcoin is indeed a living organism.
The second part will take a closer look at Bitcoin’s various habitats,
and how changes in these habitats might affect the organism. In the
third part we will dissect the Bitcoin organism, trying to understand
some of its parts in more detail. Finally, we will perform the thought
experiment of trying to kill Bitcoin, to illustrate the remarkable
resilience of this strange, decentralized organism.</p>

What is Life?

<p>The question of whether something is alive or not obviously hinges on
one’s definition of life. Life is endlessly complex, so it is no
surprise that answering the question “What is Life?” leads to a
multitude of answers. New-age speculations aside, it seems that life is
a process, not a substance.</p>

<p>We can try to describe this process by looking at things which are
alive, and looking at what they do: they tend to grow, reproduce, and
respond. They inherit traits, are made up of smaller units (cells), and
use energy to maintain their internal structure in the face of entropy.</p>



  ♦


  Based on Chris Packard's Characteristics of Life, cc-by-sa 4.0



<p>From a physics perspective, living things are thermodynamic systems:
they utilize the energy-differences in their surroundings to maintain a
specific molecular organization and create copies of themselves.
Thermodynamically speaking, living systems are able to decrease their
internal entropy at the expense of “free” energy taken in from the
environment. In short, living things create order out of chaos.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is doing exactly that: it takes energy from the environment and
puts things in order, i.e. it decreases its internal entropy. It does so
by appending blocks to a well-ordered structure. Some call this
structure the blockchain, others call it a distributed ledger. I will
refrain from using either name, since the name of this particular
structure isn’t important, and doesn’t help to convey a deeper truth:
that this structure is just one part of a large and complex system, just
like the backbone in vertebrates. It is important, no doubt. But
distributed or not, a ledger on its own is as useful and as alive as a
bag of bones.</p>

<p>To understand why Bitcoin behaves animatedly we will have to look beyond
the buzzwords and ask ourselves what Bitcoin actually is, what it is
made of, and what its boundaries are.</p>

What is Bitcoin?

<p>Compared to biological life, Bitcoin is quite simple. Nevertheless,
finding a succinct answer to “What is Bitcoin?” is not.</p>

<p>Depending on your background it might be a computer network, a financial
revolution, a way to protect your wealth, a payment system, a global
settlement layer, an alternative to central banking, sound money, a
parallel economy, an exercise in free speech, a bubble, a pyramid
scheme, a messaging system, a communications protocol, an inefficient
database, internet money, or all of the above. In short, Bitcoin is
different things to different people.</p>

<p>Whatever Bitcoin might be, it undoubtedly is a force to be reckoned
with. It has a life of its own, and thus arguably, it is best described
as a living thing.</p>

<p>Many people seem to have come to this conclusion independently. Bitcoin
is described as an army of leaf-cutter ants in Andreas M.
Antonopoulos’ Mastering Bitcoin — a biological system which is
working in concert without a central coordinator. The honey badger, an
animal which is commonly used to refer to Bitcoin (since it doesn’t care
and isn’t afraid of anything) is on the cover of Jimmy Song’s
Programming Bitcoin. Dan Held compared the invention of Bitcoin to
planting a tree, examining the species (code), season (timing), soil
(distribution), and gardening (community) that were essential to its
success. Brandon Quittem postulates that Bitcoin is most similar to
mycelium, the underground network which powers the fungi kingdom, and
can thus be best understood as a decentralized organism.</p>

<p>The snake of regulation and central banking is biting you while you are
eating it alive? Honey badger don’t care! And just like an army of
ants doesn’t care if half of the workers are washed away by a flood, the
Bitcoin network doesn’t care if half of the nodes are offline tomorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Honey badger don’t care, honey badger don’t give a fuck.”
<cite>Randall</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Memes like these, especially if they survive and continue to be popular
over a long period of time, tend to be right, conceptually. What people
seem to be saying when they refer to Bitcoin as the honey badger is
that, in essence, Bitcoin behaves like an animal which can’t be
controlled, can’t be tamed, and doesn’t care too much about
externalities.</p>

<p>Which particular organism Bitcoin resembles most closely will be left as
an exercise for the reader. The above examples should merely illustrate
that multiple authors made the intellectual leap of classifying Bitcoin
as a living organism - a leap which I believe to be fascinating, useful,
and ultimately, correct.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a living organism, and we should try to understand it as such
if we want to live in harmony with it.</p>

The Bitcoin Organism

<p>As mentioned above, Ralph Merkle was the first to point out that Bitcoin
can be seen as a living entity. He remarked that Bitcoin has spawned an
incredible amount of excitement in the technical community, and tried to
translate this excitement into something which can be understood by
everybody: a new form of life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Briefly, and non-technically, Bitcoin is the first example of a new
form of life. It lives and breathes on the internet. It lives because
it can pay people to keep it alive. It lives because it performs a
useful service that people will pay it to perform. It lives because
anyone, anywhere, can run a copy of its code. It lives because all the
running copies are constantly talking to each other. It lives because
if any one copy is corrupted it is discarded, quickly and without any
fuss or muss. It lives because it is radically transparent: anyone can
see its code and see exactly what it does.”
<cite>Ralph Merkle</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Bitcoin is indeed radically transparent, it is not perfectly
obvious where Bitcoin begins and where it ends. Like all living things,
Bitcoin isn’t just a uniform blob of matter. It is a dynamic, living
thing, consisting of many different parts, all of which communicate with
and influence each other, as well as other living things and the
environment as a whole.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin organism is made up of many interlocking parts which work
together to ensure the survival of the whole. As with biological
organisms, as soon as one crucial part is missing, the whole organism is
bound to die.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, however, is a strange beast. It lives across domains, with one
foot in the purely informational realm (ideas and code) and one foot in
the physical realm (people and nodes).</p>



  ♦




<p>The Bitcoin organism manifests itself through the interplay of ideas,
code, people, and nodes. All four of these conceptual pieces react to
and influence each other in a value-generating feedback loop which
keeps Bitcoin alive.</p>

<p>Whether people are part of the Bitcoin organism, or merely living in
symbiosis with it, depends on your point of view. For now, let’s take an
all-encompassing view of the Bitcoin organism, including people as one
part of the whole. After all, just like we can’t live without a
multitude of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other creepy-crawlies which
make up the human microbiome, Bitcoin can’t live without us: the tiny
beings in meatspace which keep it alive.</p>

<p>In any case, nodes and their operators are tangible things which are
manifest in the physical world. Like the cells in your body, all
physical components of the Bitcoin organism can and will be replaced
over time. Node operators come and go, node and mining hardware is
replaced periodically, and even whole mining farms go offline and are
replaced by more cost-efficient facilities.</p>

<p>Ideas and code are more ethereal. They can’t be grasped or pointed to in
the same fashion. However, Bitcoin has an essence, the soul of the
organism, if you like. Note that this essence could, in theory, breathe
life into a new host if the current incarnation of the organism dies.
The ghost of Bitcoin is independent of its physical body, to borrow a
metaphor from Shirow’s Ghost in the Shell.</p>

<p>As long as something is compatible with this essence, it will be treated
as part of the whole. If something is incompatible, however, it will be
rejected — just like biological organisms reject foreign objects
inside their bodies.</p>

<p>Part of this essence is made explicit by Bitcoin’s consensus rules,
other parts are repeated as mantras: “not your keys, not your bitcoin”
and “run your own node” are gentle reminders of lessons learned, as
well as shortcuts to a deeper understanding of what Bitcoin is and
should be.</p>

<p>With a basic idea of the constituents and the extent of the Bitcoin
organism in mind, let’s return to the descriptive definition of life
above and see how Bitcoin maps onto each trait.</p>



  ♦




<ul>
  <li>Growth: Bitcoin grows in multiple ways. The network grows, the
value of each bitcoin grows, the market grows, its user base grows,
and the ecosystem as a whole grows as well.</li>
  <li>Reproduction: Paradoxically, Bitcoin uses replication to create
absolute scarcity. It reproduces itself in multiple ways, and on
multiple levels: the source code is replicated across repositories,
the software is copying itself upon installation, the ledger
reproduces itself on every node, blocks propagate across the network
by replication, and even UTXOs can be understood as reproductive
entities, dividing and merging during the transaction process.
Mutations exist on every level as well: invalid transactions,
invalid blocks, hundreds of forks, and thousands of imperfect copies
have been spawned by Bitcoin in the last couple of years.</li>
  <li>Heredity: Bitcoin inherits several traits from its
predecessors: public-key cryptography, digital signatures,
peer-to-peer networking, digital timestamping, and unforgeable
costliness — just to name a few. Further, Bitcoin’s open nature
enables both vertical and horizontal gene transfer: some traits
develop by gradual mutations of previous versions, others find their
way into the codebase by incorporating ideas from other
projects.</li>
  <li>Homeostasis: Above all else, Bitcoin’s consensus rules are
responsible for its stable inner conditions. If blocks do not adhere
to the current consensus rules, they will be rejected mercilessly
and quickly. The Bitcoin network will rid itself of these blocks
just like we shed the dead cells of our skin.</li>
  <li>Metabolism: Mining rigs around the world keep the organism
alive, erecting virtually impenetrable walls in the process.
Energy is transformed into digital amber, ensuring that the shield
around past transactions is growing and Bitcoin’s heart keeps
beating.</li>
  <li>Cellular: Multiple parts of Bitcoin are cellular: the Bitcoin
network consists of nodes, each of which a self-sustaining,
functional entity. The ledger itself is cellular since blocks (and
transactions) are basically cells in a large, append-only
spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Responsive: Bitcoin is a highly responsive organism. It
responds to changes in price, political changes, economic changes,
environmental changes (e.g. if parts of the internet are cut off),
technological changes (e.g. breakthroughs in chip manufacturing),
and changes in our scientific understanding (e.g. breakthroughs in
computer science, mathematics, or cryptography). It reacts on its
own, without any person, company, or nation-state in charge.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned above, life is a process, not a substance. A delicate dance
of innumerable parts, all signaling and communicating in an intricate
way to self-sustain each organism, and the phenomenon which we call life
as a whole.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Life is like fire, not water; it is a process, not a pure substance.
[…] The simplest, but not the only, proof of life is to find
something that is alive.”
<cite>Christopher McKay</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the words of astrobiologist Chris McKay, the simplest proof of life
is to find something that is alive. I have found Bitcoin, and as far as
I can tell, it is alive — for all the reasons outlined above.</p>



Conclusion

<p>Bitcoin checks all the boxes when it comes to the characteristics of
living things: it grows, reproduces, inherits and passes on traits, uses
energy to maintain a stable inner structure, is cellular in nature, and
responds to the various environments it lives in.</p>

<p>In the next part of this series we will take a closer look at these
environments, and how Bitcoin responds to changes in them. Bitcoin lives
and breathes on the internet, as Ralph Merkle beautifully said. But
arguably, the internet isn’t the only environment it is living in.</p>

<p>For now, I hope to have convinced you that Bitcoin can be seen as a
living organism — alien as it may be.</p>

  <p>Not too long ago, Bitcoin was a niche interest. Cryptographers,
cypherpunks, and some libertarian-minded folks were the only ones
interested in the idea of magic internet money.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today, and the U.S. President, the Treasury Secretary,
the Chairman of the Fed, members of Congress, and members of the House
of Representatives spoke publicly about Bitcoin — all in the course of
a couple of days.</p>

<p>We now live in a world where “there’s bitcoin, and then there’s
shitcoin” is immortalized in the congressional record, the Fed
recognizes Bitcoin as “an alternative to gold” and “a store of value,”
and at least one news anchor is full-on Bitcoin woke.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin continues to creep into public consciousness, more and more
people — politicians and news anchors included — have to ask
themselves some hard questions around money, control, and the difference
between Bitcoin and shitcoins. Government-issued or not.</p>

<p>The world is waking up to Bitcoin, and conversations which used to be confined
to #BitcoinTwitter are now had in the wider public. What a
glorious time to be alive.</p>



Understanding Bitcoin in 3 Stages

<p>Bitcoin is quite a complex beast, combining many disciplines in
non-trivial ways. Understanding what it does, how it works, and what the
implications are, takes a little while.</p>

<p>Many people dismiss Bitcoin at first. They might think it’s stupid,
arguing it can never work. They might think Bitcoin is inefficient,
convinced that some random shitcoin can solve the same problem more
efficiently. They might think it’s a fad, magic internet money which
will go away after a while.</p>

<p>After dismissing Bitcoin, angrily admitting that it is still a thing,
you might want to try to outlaw it. Especially if you are in or close to
the money printing business. The ban, of course, will prove to be
ineffective. Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, and banning it in your
jurisdiction will only hurt you, not Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Stage three is the realization that stopping Bitcoin is a herculean
task, bordering on the impossible. Killing a beast without any heads is
difficult enough. To make things even worse, this particular beast is
living in cyberspace, not bound to a single jurisdiction, feeding on
human greed, and getting stronger with every attack.</p>

<p>The last couple of weeks showcased all three stages, happening all at
once in various public hearings and discussions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>“I am not a fan of Bitcoin”</li>
  <li>“We have to outlaw Bitcoin”</li>
  <li>“You can’t kill Bitcoin”</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s examine those stages one-by-one.</p>

Stage 1: “I am not a fan of Bitcoin”

<p>On July 12, 2019, the most powerful orange man in the world decided to
tweet his opinion about the most powerful orange coin in the world to
his 62 million followers.</p>



  

  ♦

  




<p>What does this mean for Bitcoin? Apart from free publicity, not too
much. The orange honey badger still fails to care about politics and
thus the Bitcoin network will happily continue to produce blocks whether
it has presidential approval or not.</p>

<p>Since there is no bad publicity for Bitcoin, the only thing that might
happen is that a certain percentage of these 62 million followers —
some of which undoubtedly never heard of Bitcoin before — will start
to fall down the rabbit hole.</p>

<p>One person which seems to have caught a mild case of the orange fever is
Joe Squawk, which brought us this insanely bullish segment as a reaction
to the Trump tweet.</p>



  

  ♦

  


  "You could sway him on cryptocurrencies?" "On Bitcoin."



<p>As mentioned above, the U.S. president wasn’t the only one commenting on
Bitcoin recently. The Chair of the Federal Reserve tried his best to
tell everyone that Bitcoin has no adoption, except for the fact that
people use it as a store of value, like gold.</p>



<p>Just in case you missed the important bit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If a cryptocurrency system were to become prevalent throughout the globe,
would that diminish or remove the need for a reserve currency in the
traditional sense?” “Things like that are possible. But we really haven’t seen
them. We haven’t seen widespread adoption. I mean, Bitcoin is a good example.
Really almost no one uses Bitcoin for payments. They use it more as an
alternative to gold, really. It’s a store of value. It’s a speculative
store of value, like gold.”
<cite>Jerome H. Powell</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me rephrase the above, to get to the essence of what was said.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Question: If hyperbitcoinization would occur, would that make
the federal reserve obsolete?</li>
  <li>Answer, by the chairman of the Fed: Yes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alright. Now that the danger Bitcoin poses to the powers that be is
properly understood, we can move on to the next stage of understanding
Bitcoin: trying to outlaw it.</p>

Stage 2: “We have to outlaw Bitcoin”

<p>A few weeks before the presidential tweet, a member of Congress urged to
introduce a bill to outlaw all cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>What would this mean for Bitcoin? Well, first of all, Bitcoin is bigger
than U.S. law, and second of all, laws aren’t very effective if they
can’t be enforced in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>However, after the introductory “we have to outlaw Bitcoin” speech, a
magical thing happened. It seems that this particular congressman
understands Bitcoin quite well since he made the case for Bitcoin better
than any maximalist could.</p>

<p>Watch below as Representative Chad Shillman beautifully explains
Bitcoin’s value proposition in less than one minute.</p>



<p>Once the value proposition is properly understood, the last stage is to
wrap your head around Bitcoin’s decentralized nature.</p>

Stage 3: “You can’t kill Bitcoin”

<p>One of the side-effects of grasping Bitcoin is having the humbling and
profound realization that it is virtually impossible to shut down. This
beast is bloody hard to kill, and once you realize this, you have two
options: (1) fight it and become a joke, (2) join it and become woke.</p>

<p>If you would’ve told me 6 months ago that a Bitcoin-woke news anchor
would interview a Bitcoin-woke politician on CNBC, I would have laughed
you out of the room. Yet, here we are, live on TV, with blue shirts and
colorful ties and all.</p>



<p>The point made by Rep. Patrick McHenry is worth reiterating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no capacity to kill Bitcoin. Even the Chinese with their
firewall and their extreme intervention in their society could not
kill Bitcoin. […] My point here is: You can’t kill Bitcoin.”
<cite>Rep. Patrick McHenry</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As if this wasn’t bullish enough, the same politician goes on to
re-iterate the unstoppable nature of Bitcoin in his opening statement to
the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services.</p>



<p>Again, the opening statement made by Rep. Patrick McHenry is worth
reiterating:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The reality is, whether Facebook is involved or not, change is here. Digital
currencies exist. Blockchain technology is real. And Facebook’s entry in this
new world is just confirmation, albeit at scale. The world that Satoshi
Nakamoto — author of the Bitcoin whitepaper — envisioned, and others are
building, is an unstoppable force. We should not attempt to deter this
innovation. And governments can not stop this innovation. And those that have
tried, have already failed.”
<cite>Rep. Patrick McHenry</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Take a moment to let that sink in.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Governments can not stop this innovation.”</li>
  <li>“Bitcoin is an unstoppable force.”</li>
  <li>“You can’t kill Bitcoin.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Just three years ago, the above was only to be read in an obscure
paper written by the cryptographer Ralph Merkle. He argued that Bitcoin
is a new form of life, one that can’t be changed, can’t be argued with,
can’t be tampered with, can’t be corrupted, can’t be interrupted, and
can’t be stopped.</p>

<p>Three years later, and what was first articulated as a non-technical
metaphor to help convey the fascinating nature of Bitcoin is now par for
the course in the U.S. Congress and on TV.</p>



The Future is Bullish

<p>Bitcoin continues to win the hearts and minds of the people it touches.
This includes the hearts and minds of politicians, news anchors,
bankers, and others which are currently among the powerful and
influential.</p>

<p>If you would have told me that it would be possible to be even more
bullish than I was 6 months ago, I wouldn’t have believed you. Yet here
we are. Bitcoiners in Congress, Bitcoiners on TV, and the president of
the United States shitposting about Bitcoin. What a glorious time to be
alive.</p>

<p>The world is waking up to Bitcoin, and I’m more bullish than I’ve ever
been.</p>

  <p>Bitcoin is different things to different people. Whatever it might be to
you, it is undoubtedly an opinionated and polarizing phenomenon. There
are certain ideas embedded in the essence of Bitcoin, and you might be
intrigued by some or all of them.</p>

<p>The invention of Bitcoin, and its underlying blockchain, which is so
widely misunderstood, spawned many projects, networks, and communities.
Some of these networks are in direct competition, which has resulted in
endless conflicts and lots of debate. The root of these conflicts is
ideological in nature: disagreement about how the world is and how it
should be — a disagreement about ideas.</p>

<p>The following is an attempt to explain some of the reasons behind this
polarization, explore the underlying dynamics in more detail, and
illustrate why an increasing number of people seem to be gravitating
towards Bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are some oddities in the perspective with which we see the
world. The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on
the surface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90
million miles away and think this to be normal is obviously some
indication of how skewed our perspective tends to be, but we have done
various things over intellectual history to slowly correct some of our
misapprehensions.” 
<cite>Douglas Adams</cite></p>
</blockquote>

Agreeing on a Set of Ideas

<p>The goal of the Bitcoin network is to reach consensus, a general
agreement on the state of the system. Bitcoin’s breakthrough innovation
was utilizing unforgeable costliness to reach global consensus without
relying on a central authority.</p>

<p>Bitcoin can be understood as a game that anyone can join. Like all
games, it can only be played if it has rules, certain ideas which are
internally consistent. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be a game; it would be
chaos.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Before any game can be played, the rules have to be established;
before the game can be altered, the rules have to be made manifest.
[…] All those who know the rules, and accept them, can play the
game — without fighting over the rules of the game. This makes for
peace, stability, and potential prosperity — a good game. The good,
however, is the enemy of the better; a more compelling game might
always exist.” 
<cite>Maps of Meaning</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin’s consensus rules are just that: a set of ideas, codified into
validation rules, acted out by nodes on the network. Changing this core
set of ideas is akin to changing what Bitcoin is, and the decentralized
nature of the network makes changing them extremely difficult. There is
no central authority to dictate changes, making unanimous adoption of a
new set of ideas virtually impossible. Anyone who changes the rules,
even if he thinks such a change is for the better, will start to play a
different game, with only those who join him.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin’s creator famously said: the nature of Bitcoin is such
that once the first version was released, the core design was set in
stone for the rest of its lifetime.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, Satoshi had certain ideas in mind when he created Bitcoin.
Many of these ideas are articulated in his writing, and even in the
genesis block. Most importantly, however, his core ideas are codified
in Bitcoin’s consensus rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>fixed supply</li>
  <li>no central point of failure</li>
  <li>no possibility of confiscation or censorship</li>
  <li>everything can be validated by everyone at all times</li>
</ul>

<p>This set of ideas is embedded in the rules of the network, and you have
to adopt them to participate. In essence, a network like Bitcoin encodes
a social contract in its software: ideas which are shared by everyone
on the network.</p>

Spreading ideas

<p>All great things start small, and Bitcoin was no exception. In the
beginning, it was one node, one piece of software, one person, one set
of ideas. On 31 October 2008, the Bitcoin whitepaper was published. Two
months later, on 3 January 2009, the genesis block was mined. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout
for banks.” 
<cite>Bitcoin’s Genesis Block</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took only two days until a second person was intrigued enough to join
the network. Hal Finney ran the software, connected to Satoshi’s node,
and the Bitcoin network was born. Soon, other people picked up on the
idea, ran the software, and set up their nodes to join the network. The
rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin network is a complex piece of machinery. The constituents of
the network — part technology, part biology — make it inherently
difficult to describe and understand. While the following doesn’t claim
to be a complete description of the system by any means, I think it’s
helpful to focus on some constituents in more detail. In particular, I
want to focus on the following four: ideas, people, code,
and nodes.</p>



  ♦


  Bitcoin's ingredients: two parts software, two parts hardware.



<p>On the physical layer, the network is made up of interconnecting
nodes. Bitcoin’s consensus rules are embodied in its software, i.e.
the code which is running on its nodes. Ultimately, people are
choosing which software to run, a decision which is shaped by the set of
ideas they hold.</p>

<p>The possibility of running self-sovereign nodes is part of the reason
why Bitcoin’s consensus rules are so hard to change. As mentioned above,
there is no central authority, no entity to trust. Changes have to be
adopted voluntarily by everyone. People are free to run any version of
the software, be it out of conviction, laziness, or contempt.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a system “based on cryptographic proof instead of trust,” to
quote the whitepaper. The implication is that you are the authority
and you have to verify everything for yourself from scratch. Out of
this, consensus emerges.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Freedom brings men rudely and directly face to face with their own
personal responsibility for their own free actions.” 
<cite>Frank Meyer, In Defense of Freedom</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As soon as consensus is reached on the network, value comes into play.
That bitcoins — or any monies, for that matter — have value, is in
itself an idea that people need to be convinced of. </p>

<p>For Bitcoin, this process took almost 500 days. When the network was in
its infancy, bitcoins weren’t worth anything. They were mined and sent
back and forth between curious cypherpunks. However, the moment Laszlo
exchanged 10,000 BTC for two pizzas, Bitcoin went from zero to one. In
an instant, the network became valuable in a tangible way.</p>

<p>Ever since this moment, the following idea-value feedback loop is at
play:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bitcoin’s set of ideas — its value proposition — is
 attracting people.</li>
  <li>Those people freely choose which code to run.</li>
  <li>The selected code runs on individual nodes, dictating their
 behavior.</li>
  <li>Nodes join the network, connecting to peers who share their
 ideas.</li>
  <li>The network reaches consensus, enabling agreement on who owns
 what.</li>
  <li>The value, in turn, is based on the set of ideas enforced by
 consensus rules: the embodiment of its value proposition.</li>
</ol>

  Idea-value feedback loop.



<p>This idea-value feedback loop, the re-enforcement of ideas through value
creation, is the mechanism behind Bitcoin’s gravity. Everything in this
cycle influences everything else — whether it is software, hardware,
or wetware. This loop is what ultimately captures people, and since
Bitcoin’s core set of ideas is virtually fixed, it has some surprising
effects on the sets of ideas held by people.</p>

Bitcoin’s Gravity Well

<p>As we have seen above, Bitcoin is an opinionated piece of software,
creating an opinionated network. The result of an opinionated network is
that it attracts opinionated people. </p>

<p>Arguably, most early adopters of Bitcoin shared its core set of ideas.
As Dan Held points out in Planting Bitcoin, Satoshi carefully chose
the initial group of people: cryptographers and cypherpunks, who
understood the technical components Bitcoin is made of.</p>

<p>There are many paths which might bring you close to Bitcoin’s
gravitational pull: you might have an interest in cryptography,
information security, or financial technologies. You may hold certain
political or economic beliefs. You might be a gold bug, free speech
advocate, or a speculator. You may need to use Bitcoin out of necessity.
Whatever the reasons for your initial contact with Bitcoin, there is a
certain probability that you are pulled in. Satoshi alluded to this
multi-dimensional attractiveness in one of his emails to the
cryptography mailing list.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain
it properly. I’m better with code than with words though.” 
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to illustrate this is by visualizing a landscape of ideas. Since
the number of all possible ideas is basically infinite, we will have to
focus on a small subset. And since we are talking about Bitcoin, we will
focus on the small universe of ideas spawned by asking the question of
what Bitcoin is.</p>



  ♦


  What is Bitcoin?



<p>Ask three strangers what Bitcoin is, and you will probably get three
very different answers. Any answer is necessarily shaped by past
experience, political and economic beliefs, and an individual
understanding of the world. Your personal set of ideas, your world view,
defines where you are on the landscape of ideas.</p>

<p>The landscape has sets of ideas which clump together: narratives,
which help to explain what Bitcoin is. One person might think of Bitcoin
primarily as digital gold, focusing on the store of value aspect of
Bitcoin. Another person might think of Bitcoin as a payment system,
focusing on the medium of exchange aspect of Bitcoin. Yet another person
might think of Bitcoin as a way to automate more complex social
constructs, focusing on automation of contracts and similar ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Nobody can know everything. The complexity of society is irreducible.
We cling to mental models that satisfy our thirst for understanding a
given phenomenon, and stick to groups who identify with similar
narratives.”
<cite> Dan Held</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These narratives, these sets of ideas, describe both what Bitcoin
actually is — at least in part — and what people think it is.
These narratives will necessarily evolve over time as our understanding
of the system and the system itself evolves. Neither ideas, nor people,
nor Bitcoin, nor the world at large are static things. Our visions of
Bitcoin have changed, and will continue to do so in the future.</p>

<p>Whatever Bitcoin is, it acts as a gravity well in this universe of
ideas. If your set of ideas overlaps with those embodied by Bitcoin, you
are close to its gravity well and captured easily. If your set of ideas
is opposed to Bitcoin’s, you are far away from its gravitational pull
and remain unattracted.</p>



  ♦


  What is Bitcoin?



<p>Consequently, Bitcoin is attracting opinionated people who share certain
ideas and ideals. “Birds of a feather flock together,” as the saying
goes. In this case, many nerd-birds and cypherpunks flocked around
Bitcoin early. Not particularly surprising.</p>

<p>What is surprising, however, is the side-effect of an opinionated
network: it influences people. Since the set of ideas embodied by
Bitcoin is fixed, it is the set of ideas held by people which has to
align — not vice-versa. The last ten years have shown that Bitcoin is
very effective in changing minds. So far, no single mind was
particularly effective in changing it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So the universe is not quite as you thought it was. You’d better
rearrange your beliefs, then. Because you certainly can’t rearrange
the universe.”
 — Isaac Asimov</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To repeat an old TFTC trope: Bitcoin will change us more than we will
change it, as I have learned myself.</p>

Attraction and Repulsion

<p>But what if your set of ideas does not overlap with Bitcoin’s? What if
you wish to change Bitcoin’s set of ideas, not convinced of the futility
of this endeavor? What if you are downright repulsed by some of its
ideas?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The miracle of physics that I’m talking about here is something that
was actually known since the time of Einstein’s general relativity;
that gravity is not always attractive. Gravity can act
repulsively.”
<cite>Alan Guth</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are truly repulsed by Bitcoin’s ideas, you might end up drifting
away into space, joining the interstellar void where nocoiners float
around.</p>

<p>If you want to change Bitcoin’s ideas in a fundamental way, you might
end up creating another gravity well. This is easily possible because of
Bitcoin’s openness. Its open source code, permissionless network
structure, and lack of formal organization of any kind allows anyone to
copy, modify, and run the code without asking for permission.</p>

<p>As outlined above, changing the core rules of Bitcoin results in a new
game — different from the game everyone else is playing. To not play
alone, you would have to convince other people to play with you. If you
want to have the same number of people to play with, you will have to
convince everyone on the network that your set of ideas is better than
the one held by everyone else. And since this is mostly a financial
game, strong network effects are very beneficial; it is in your best
interest to convince everyone.</p>

<p>Failing to do so will create a competing system; either by creating a
new network or by splitting off from the existing Bitcoin network. Since
all new projects are inspired by Bitcoin, the set of ideas necessarily
overlaps; sometimes almost exactly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Tracking narratives is a good way to help people understand that
there are, in fact, a menu of beliefs competing for their affiliation;
[…] Trying to identify where one narrative ends and another begins
is a challenging task, as ideas tend to have permeable borders.”
<cite>Nathaniel Whittemore</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since creating new gravity wells is (a) possible and (b) relatively easy
to do (copy Bitcoin’s code, change a few parameters, launch the new
network with a couple of friends) there was an explosion of alternative
coins in the last few years. While most of these altcoins are outright
scams, some try to find a niche, attracting people who share its new or
modified set of ideas.</p>



  ♦


  Different ideas are captured by different gravity wells.



<p>Being sucked into one of these gravity wells — and thus into an
idea-value feedback loop — is the reason for much of the toxicity we
see in Bitcoin and elsewhere. The direct link between holding beliefs
(ideas) and holding assets (value) is a multiplying factor which can
result in ever deeper entrenchment. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everyone knows nowadays that people “have complexes.” What is not so
well known, though far more important theoretically, is that complexes
can have us.” 
<cite>Carl Jung</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One could argue, as Carl Jung did in relationship to complexes, that
blockchains have people. At the root of every gravity well is a set
of ideas and a group of people which are had by them.</p>

<p>Once captured, a difference in technicalities can easily become a
difference in ideologies — and vice versa. Giving up on ideas is
difficult in any case, but if your net worth is intractably linked these
ideas it becomes ever more difficult.</p>

Orbits and Collisions

<p>The formation of any gravity well isn’t exactly a smooth ride. Just like
stellar and planetary formation is violent at times — suns swallowing
planets, planets bumping into each other, and moons being smashed to
pieces — the formation of Bitcoin’s gravity well had some violent
events too. </p>

<p>I plan to explore some of these events in the future, but for now, let’s
just acknowledge that there are other projects orbiting Bitcoin and that
there have been collisions in the past.</p>



  ♦

<p>Whether all other projects will be swallowed by Bitcoin or die on their
own, or whether some will find stable orbits, is yet to be seen. What
can be observed today, however, is that most networks are competitive.
To quote Eric Hoffer: “the gain of one in adherents is the loss of all
the others.”</p>

<p>What can also be observed, since it has happened multiple times over the
last couple of years, is that projects which fail to deliver on their
value proposition are quickly losing most of their adherents and also
their value — the former due to disillusion, the latter due to market
forces. Value, and speculation on future value, is an integral part of
the idea-value feedback loop. If ideas don’t materialize or fail, real
(and speculative) value is lost, which is effectively killing those
ideas and the networks which embody them.</p>

<p>However, as long as people hold different sets of ideas, and as long as
a project in Bitcoin’s orbit embodies this set of ideas, people will
flock to it. Whether those ideas have merit will be decided by time, the
open market, and ultimately, reality. Horrible ideas don’t work at all,
bad ideas not for long, and solutions which aren’t substantially better
than the status quo won’t thrive in a free market.</p>

<p>The best ideas, however, might be discovered by the biggest networks and
will be assimilated, if assimilation is possible. If Bitcoin can eat it,
it will eat it.</p>

Feeding on Ideas

<p>As mentioned above, Bitcoin’s core set of ideas is fixed from day one.
However, this doesn’t imply that Bitcoin can’t be improved. It can and
should be improved, but it has to be improved in ways that don’t
destroy the essence of Bitcoin. Such improvements are happening all the
time, which is why we can send payments to script hashes, have
segregated witness, and can pay small amounts quickly and cheaply on
the lightning network.</p>

<p>The technicalities of improving Bitcoin — and the important difference
between a soft and a hard fork — are well worth exploring, but are
beyond the scope of this article. Without going into more details in
regards to the nature of these improvements, Bitcoin undoubtedly is
improving, and thus its feature set is changing and expanding.</p>

<p>In terms of gravitational pull, this means that Bitcoin is gaining mass.
The set of ideas which describes Bitcoin is expanding along with its
feature set, potentially capturing more people and swallowing competing
projects and ideas in the process.</p>

<p>The idea of cheap payments, for example, has re-emerged thanks to
payment channels on the lightning network. While still in its early
stages, other projects built on this idea will lose their merit if the
lightning network is successful on a large scale. </p>

<p>Privacy is another idea which is at the root of several competing
projects. If future privacy enhancements in Bitcoin prove to be
successful (Schnorr signatures, lightning, whirlpool, wallets
supporting CoinJoins), these projects might be swallowed by Bitcoin as
well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their
houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their
goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into
the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among
the congregation.” 
<cite>Book of Numbers</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not saying that all other projects will perish, necessarily. But
networks thrive because of network effects: the winner takes most, if
not all.</p>

The Value of Conviction

<p>Whenever people are debating ideas, tribalism is the norm, not the
exception. Whether it is politics, sports, iPhone vs Android, or
pineapple on pizza, people identify with the camp that is closest to
their ideas and ideals.</p>

<p>While the validity of ideas are sometimes hard to measure, either
because their consequences are very indirect (politics) or subjective
and not truly consequential in the grand scheme of things (pineapple on
pizza), networks like Bitcoin come with a direct measurement: value.</p>

<p>While this value can be distorted by both manipulation and speculation,
it is a reliable and (almost) direct indicator of both conviction and
validity of ideas. If more people are convinced by a network’s set of
ideas, more people will hold its native token as an asset. And the more
those ideas align with reality, the more real-world value is generated
by the network, convincing more people and deepening the convictions of
those already convinced.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has the largest gravity for a reason: it works since day one,
solves real problems for real people, generating real value. It works
because its set of ideas aligns most closely with reality. It is
valuable because people believe in its value proposition, and with good
reason: Bitcoin is the largest, most secure, most robust network for
permissionless and digital value transfer to date. And it is growing.</p>

<p>Whether you are already convinced by Bitcoin’s ideas or are
diametrically opposed to them, Bitcoin will continue to not care. Its
gravitational pull will continue to increase, swallowing ideas, people,
code, and nodes in the process.</p>

Conclusion

<p>We have seen that Bitcoin embodies a certain set of ideas in its
consensus rules and overall architecture. Changing Bitcoin’s core set of
ideas is virtually impossible, which is why its core design is “set in
stone” since day one.</p>

<p>The idea-value feedback loop is what creates Bitcoin’s gravity. People
coming close to this feedback loop have a certain probability of being
captured, which forces them to align their own set of ideas with
Bitcoin’s or “fork off.”</p>

<p>Understanding that any unchanging system will change its participants is
helpful in understanding both attraction to and repulsion by Bitcoin.
Since changing the core set of ideas is not an option, new projects
embodying new sets of ideas are launched, creating new gravity wells in
the process.</p>

<p>A different idea-value feedback loop is the basis for each gravity well.
Tribalism and loss-aversion help to explain some of the toxicity between
competing projects and communities, since falling into any feedback loop
will taint the world view of anyone captured by it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For one can fall victim to possession if one does not understand
betimes why one is possessed. One should ask oneself for once: Why has
this idea taken possession of me? What does that mean in regard
to myself?” 
<cite>Carl Jung</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both the world and Bitcoin are dynamic things, making any set of ideas
we currently hold insufficient for a permanent, complete view of either.
Bitcoin can and does change, even if its essence is virtually
unchangeable. No matter our individual beliefs, we must not get too
attached to any narrative, or to any set of ideas.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s dominance is no accident. Its set of ideas managed to convince
the largest group of people, generating the most value in turn. However,
exploring other ideas can be a good and healthy thing, if pursued
genuinely. Time and the free market will decide which ideas align with
reality. Bad ideas will vanish, and good ideas will be absorbed. </p>

<p>In a world where people hold a combination of ideas and valuable assets,
a feedback loop which links and reinforces both is a powerful force of
attraction. Whether you just started to feel Bitcoin’s gentle pull or
you’ve been a hodlonaut in close orbit, Bitcoin’s gravity will
continue to increase. I am convinced of that idea, and I hope to have
planted a seed of conviction in you as well.</p>

  <p>What is Bitcoin? The many answers to this question are as interesting as
they are varied. Bitcoin is both a social and a monetary phenomenon, but
it is also a technological one. The intersection of many disciplines is
what makes Bitcoin endlessly fascinating. Like many others, I began to
stumble down this strange rabbit hole a while ago. Even though this
article is the last of this series, I am still stumbling down with no
end in sight, and I invite you to stumble along with me.</p>

<p>This is the third chapter of a personal journey. Again, I am indebted to
Arjun Balaji who asked the following on Twitter: “What have you
learned from Bitcoin?” It is this question which has led me to write
this series to outline some of the things I’ve learned.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Philosophical Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
  <li>Economic Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
  <li>Technological Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
</ol>

<p>Part one explored what I’ve learned from Bitcoin when seen through a
philosophical lens: the interplay of immutability and change, copying
and scarcity, Bitcoin’s origin story and identity, locality in a world
of replication, money as free speech, and the limits of knowledge.</p>

<p>Part two discussed some of the economic teachings of Bitcoin: the
concept of value, (sound) money and its history, inflation, and some
aspects of “modern” banking like fractional reserve banking.</p>

<p>Part three will explore seven things I have learned from examining
Bitcoin through the lens of technology. As in the previous parts, I will
only be able to scratch the surface. Bitcoin is an expanding universe,
evolving and improving every day. Whole books can be and have been
written on small, specific parts of this cosmos. And just like in our
own universe, the expansion seems to be accelerating.</p>

Lesson 15: Strength in numbers

<p>Numbers are an essential part of our everyday life. Large numbers,
however, aren’t something most of us are too familiar with. The largest
numbers we might encounter in everyday life are in the range of
millions, billions, or trillions. We might read about millions of people
in poverty, billions of dollars spent on bank bailouts, and trillions of
national debt. Even though it’s hard to make sense of these headlines,
we are somewhat comfortable with the size of those numbers.</p>

<p>Although we might seem comfortable with billions and trillions, our
intuition already starts to fail with numbers of this magnitude. Do you
have an intuition how long you would have to wait for a
million/billion/trillion seconds to pass? If you are anything like me,
you are lost without actually crunching the numbers.</p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at this example: the difference between each is
an increase by three orders of magnitude: 10⁶, 10⁹, 10¹². Thinking about
seconds is not very useful, so let’s translate this into something we
can wrap our head around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10⁶: One million seconds was 1½ weeks ago.</li>
  <li>10⁹: One billion seconds was almost 32 years ago.</li>
  <li>10¹²: One trillion seconds ago Manhattan was covered under a thick
 layer of ice.</li>
</ul>



  ♦


  About 1 trillion seconds ago. Source: xkcd #1125



<p>As soon as we enter the beyond-astronomical realm of modern
cryptography, our intuition fails catastrophically. Bitcoin is built
around large numbers and the virtual impossibility of guessing them.
These numbers are way, way larger than anything we might encounter in
day-to-day life. Many orders of magnitude larger. Understanding how
large these numbers truly are is essential to understanding Bitcoin as a
whole.</p>

<p>Let’s take SHA-256, one of the hash functions used in Bitcoin, as a
concrete example. It is only natural to think about 256 bits as “two
hundred fifty-six,” which isn’t a large number at all. However, the
number in SHA-256 is talking about orders of magnitude — something our
brains are not well-equipped to deal with.</p>

<p>While bit length is a convenient metric, the true meaning of 256-bit
security is lost in translation. Similar to the millions (10⁶) and
billions (10⁹) above, the number in SHA-256 is about orders of magnitude
(2²⁵⁶).</p>

<p>So, how strong is SHA-256, exactly?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“SHA-256 is very strong. It’s not like the incremental step from MD5
to SHA1. It can last several decades unless there’s some massive
breakthrough attack.”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s spell things out. 2²⁵⁶ equals the following number:</p>

<pre><code>115 quattuorvigintillion 792 trevigintillion 89 duovigintillion 237 unvigintillion 316 vigintillion 195 novemdecillion 423 octodecillion 570 septendecillion 985 sexdecillion 8 quindecillion 687 quattuordecillion 907 tredecillion 853 duodecillion 269 undecillion 984 decillion 665 nonillion 640 octillion 564 septillion 39 sextillion 457 quintillion 584 quadrillion 7 trillion 913 billion 129 million 639 thousand 936.
</code></pre>

<p>That’s a lot of nonillions! Wrapping your head around this number is
pretty much impossible. There is nothing in the physical universe to
compare it to. It is far larger than the number of atoms in the
observable universe. The human brain simply isn’t made to make sense of
it.</p>

<p>One of the best visualizations of the true strength of SHA-256 is the
following video by Grant Sanderson. Aptly named “How secure is 256 bit
security?” it beautifully shows how large a 256-bit space is. Do
yourself a favor and take the five minutes to watch it. As all other
3Blue1Brown videos it is not only fascinating but also exceptionally
well made. Warning: You might fall down a math rabbit hole.</p>

  Answer: Pretty secure.



<p>Bruce Schneier used the physical limits of computation to put this
number into perspective: even if we could build an optimal computer,
which would use any provided energy to flip bits perfectly, build a
Dyson sphere around our sun, and let it run for 100 billion billion
years, we would still only have a 25% chance to find a needle in a
256-bit haystack.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices;
they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they
strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be
infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter
and occupy something other than space.”
<cite>Bruce Schneier</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is hard to overstate the profoundness of this. Strong cryptography
inverts the power-balance of the physical world we are so used to.
Unbreakable things do not exist in the real world. Apply enough force,
and you will be able to open any door, box, or treasure chest.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s treasure chest is very different. It is secured by strong
cryptography, which does not give way to brute force. And as long as the
underlying mathematical assumptions hold, brute force is all we have.
Granted, there is also the option of a global $5 wrench attack.
But torture won’t work for all bitcoin addresses, and the cryptographic
walls of bitcoin will defeat brute force attacks. Even if you come at it
with the force of a thousand suns. Literally.</p>

<p>This fact and its implications were poignantly summarized in the call
to cryptographic arms: “No amount of coercive force will ever solve
a math problem.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It isn’t obvious that the world had to work this way. But somehow the
universe smiles on encryption.”
<cite>Julian Assange</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody yet knows for sure if the universe’s smile is genuine or not. It
is possible that our assumption of mathematical asymmetries is wrong and
we find that P actually equals NP, or we find surprisingly quick
solutions to specific problems which we currently assume to be hard.
If that should be the case, cryptography as we know it will cease to
exist, and the implications would most likely change the world beyond
recognition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Vires in Numeris” = “Strength in Numbers”
<cite>epii</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Vires in numeris is not only a catchy motto used by bitcoiners. The
realization that there is an unfathomable strength to be found in
numbers is a profound one. Understanding this, and the inversion of
existing power balances which it enables changed my view of the world
and the future which lies ahead of us.</p>

<p>One direct result of this is the fact that you don’t have to ask anyone
for permission to participate in Bitcoin. There is no page to sign up,
no company in charge, no government agency to send application forms to.
Simply generate a large number and you are pretty much good to go. The
central authority of account creation is mathematics. And God only knows
who is in charge of that.</p>

  Elliptic curve examples (cc-by-sa Emmanuel Boutet)



<p>Bitcoin is built upon our best understanding of reality. While there are
still many open problems in physics, computer science, and mathematics,
we are pretty sure about some things. That there is an asymmetry between
finding solutions and validating the correctness of these solutions is
one such thing. That computation needs energy is another one. In other
words: finding a needle in a haystack is harder than checking if the
pointy thing in your hand is indeed a needle or not. And finding the
needle takes work.</p>

<p>The vastness of Bitcoin’s address space is truly mind-boggling. The
number of private keys even more so. It is fascinating how much of our
modern world boils down to the improbability of finding a needle in an
unfathomably large haystack. I am now more aware of this fact than ever.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that there is strength in numbers.</p>

Lesson 16: Reflections on “Don’t Trust, Verify”

<p>Bitcoin aims to replace, or at least provide an alternative to,
conventional currency. Conventional currency is bound to a centralized
authority, no matter if we are talking about legal tender like the US
dollar or modern monopoly money like Fortnite’s V-Bucks. In both
examples, you are bound to trust the central authority to issue, manage
and circulate your money. Bitcoin unties this bound, and the main issue
Bitcoin solves is the issue of trust.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s
required to make it work. […] What is needed is an electronic
payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust”
<cite>Satoshi</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin solves the problem of trust by being completely decentralized,
with no central server or trusted parties. Not even trusted third
parties, but trusted parties, period. When there is no central
authority, there simply is no-one to trust. Complete decentralization
is the innovation. It is the root of Bitcoin’s resilience, the reason
why it is still alive. Decentralization is also why we have mining,
nodes, hardware wallets, and yes, the blockchain. The only thing you
have to “trust” is that our understanding of mathematics and physics
isn’t totally off and that the majority of miners act honestly (which
they are incentivized to do).</p>

<p>While the regular world operates under the assumption of “trust, but
verify,” Bitcoin operates under the assumption of “don’t trust,
verify.” Satoshi made the importance of removing trust very clear in
both the introduction as well as the conclusion of the Bitcoin
whitepaper.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Conclusion: We have proposed a system for electronic transactions
without relying on trust.”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that “without relying on trust” is used in a very specific context
here. We are talking about trusted third parties, i.e. other entities
which you trust to produce, hold, and process your money. It is assumed,
for example, that you can trust your computer.</p>

<p>As Ken Thompson showed in his Turing Award lecture, trust is an
extremely tricky thing in the computational world. When running a
program, you have to trust all kinds of software (and hardware) which,
in theory, could alter the program you are trying to run in a malicious
way. As Thompson summarized in his Reflections on Trusting Trust:
“The moral is obvious. You can’t trust code that you did not totally
create yourself.”</p>



  ♦




<p>Thompson demonstrated that even if you have access to the source code,
your compiler — or any other program-handling program or
hardware — could be compromised and detecting this backdoor would be
very difficult. Thus, in practice, a truly trustless system does not
exist. You would have to create all your software and all your
hardware (assemblers, compilers, linkers, etc.) from scratch, without
the aid of any external software or software-aided machinery.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent
the universe.”
<cite>Carl Sagan</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Ken Thompson Hack is a particularly ingenious and hard-to-detect
backdoor, so let’s take a quick look at a hard-to-detect backdoor which
works without modifying any software. Researchers found a way to
compromise security-critical hardware by altering the polarity of
silicon impurities. Just by changing the physical properties of the
stuff that computer chips are made of they were able to compromise a
cryptographically secure random number generator. Since this change
can’t be seen, the backdoor can’t be detected by optical inspection,
which is one of the most important tamper-detection mechanism for chips
like these.</p>



  ♦


  Stealthy Dopant-Level Hardware Trojans by Becker, Regazzoni, Paar, Burleson



<p>Sounds scary? Well, even if you would be able to build everything from
scratch, you would still have to trust the underlying mathematics. You
would have to trust that secp256k1 is an elliptic curve without
backdoors. Yes, malicious backdoors can be inserted in the mathematical
foundations of cryptographic functions and arguably this has already
happened at least once. There are good reasons to be paranoid, and the
fact that everything from your hardware, to your software, to the
elliptic curves used can have backdoors are some of them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Don’t trust. Verify.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above examples should illustrate that trustless computing is
utopic. Bitcoin is probably the one system which comes closest to this
utopia, but still, it is trust-minimized — aiming to remove trust
wherever possible. Arguably, the chain-of-trust is neverending, since
you will also have to trust that computation requires energy, that P
does not equal NP, and that you are actually in base reality and not
emprisoned in a simulation by malicious actors.</p>

<p>Developers are working on tools and procedures to minimize any remaining
trust even further. For example, Bitcoin developers created Gitian,
which is a software distribution method to create deterministic builds.
The idea is that if multiple developers are able to reproduce identical
binaries, the chance of malicious tampering is reduced. Fancy backdoors
aren’t the only attack vector. Simple blackmail or extortion are real
threats as well. As in the main protocol, decentralization is used to
minimize trust.</p>

<p>Various efforts are being made to improve upon the chicken-and-egg
problem of bootstrapping which Ken Thompson’s hack so brilliantly
pointed out. One such effort is Guix (pronounced geeks), which uses
functionally declared package management leading to bit-for-bit
reproducible builds by design. The result is that you don’t have to
trust any software-providing servers anymore since you can verify that
the served binary was not tampered with by rebuilding it from scratch.
As of this writing, a pull-request is in progress to integrate Guix
into the Bitcoin build process.</p>



  ♦


  Which came first, the chicken or the egg?



<p>Luckily, Bitcoin doesn’t rely on a single algorithm or piece of
hardware. One effect of Bitcoin’s radical decentralization is a
distributed security model. Although the backdoors described above are
not to be taken lightly, it is unlikely that every software wallet,
every hardware wallet, every cryptographic library, every node
implementation, and every compiler of every language is compromised.
Possible, but highly unlikely.</p>

<p>Note that you can generate a private key without relying on any
computational hardware or software. You can flip a coin a couple of
times, although depending on your coin and tossing style this source of
randomness might not be sufficiently random. There is a reason why
storage protocols like Glacier advise to use casino-grade dice as one
of two sources of entropy.</p>

<p>Bitcoin forced me to reflect on what trusting nobody actually entails.
It raised my awareness of the bootstrapping problem, and the implicit
chain-of-trust in developing and running software. It also raised my
awareness of the many ways in which software and hardware can be
compromised.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me not to trust, but to verify.</p>

Lesson 17: Telling time takes work

<p>It is often said that bitcoins are mined because thousands of computers
work on solving very complex mathematical problems. Certain problems
are to be solved, and if you compute the right answer, you “produce” a
bitcoin. While this simplified view of bitcoin mining might be easier to
convey, it does miss the point somewhat. Bitcoins aren’t produced or
created, and the whole ordeal is not really about solving particular
math problems. Also, the math isn’t particularly complex. What is
complex is telling the time in a decentralized system.</p>

<p>As outlined in the whitepaper, the proof-of-work system (aka mining) is
a way to implement a distributed timestamp server.</p>



  ♦


  Excerpts from the whitepaper. Did someone say timechain?



<p>When I first learned how Bitcoin works I also thought that proof-of-work
is inefficient and wasteful. After a while, I started to shift my
perspective on Bitcoin’s energy consumption. It seems that
proof-of-work is still widely misunderstood today, in the year 10 AB
(after Bitcoin).</p>

<p>Since the problems to be solved in proof-of-work are made up, many
people seem to believe that it is useless work. If the focus is purely
on the computation, this is an understandable conclusion. But Bitcoin
isn’t about computation. It is about independently agreeing on the
order of things.</p>

<p>Proof-of-work is a system in which everyone can validate what happened
and in what order it happened. This independent validation is what leads
to consensus, an individual agreement by multiple parties about who owns
what.</p>

<p>In a radically decentralized environment, we don’t have the luxury of
absolute time. Any clock would introduce a trusted third party, a
central point in the system which had to be relied upon and could be
attacked. “Timing is the root problem,” as Grisha Trubetskoy points
out. And Satoshi brilliantly solved this problem by implementing a
decentralized clock via a proof-of-work blockchain. Everyone agrees
beforehand that the chain with the most cumulative work is the source of
truth. It is per definition what actually happened. This agreement is
what is now known as Nakamoto consensus.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing
chain which serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Without a consistent way to tell the time, there is no consistent way to
tell before from after. Reliable ordering is impossible. As mentioned
above, Nakamoto consensus is Bitcoin’s way to consistently tell the
time. The system’s incentive structure produces a probabilistic,
decentralized clock, by utilizing both greed and self-interest of
competing participants. The fact that this clock is imprecise is
irrelevant because the order of events is eventually unambiguous and can
be verified by anyone.</p>

<p>Thanks to proof-of-work, both the work and the validation of the work
are radically decentralized. Everyone can join and leave at will, and
everyone can validate everything at all times. Not only that, but
everyone can validate the state of the system individually, without
having to rely on anyone else for validation.</p>

<p>Understanding proof-of-work takes time. It is often counter-intuitive,
and while the rules are simple, they lead to quite complex phenomena.
For me, shifting my perspective on mining helped. Useful, not useless.
Validation, not computation. Time, not blocks.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that telling the time is tricky, especially if you are
decentralized.</p>

Lesson 18: Move slowly and don’t break things

<p>It might be a dead mantra, but “move fast and break things” is still how
much of the tech world operates. The idea that it doesn’t matter if you
get things right the first time is a basic pillar of the fail early,
fail often mentality. Success is measured in growth, so as long as you
are growing everything is fine. If something doesn’t work at first you
simply pivot and iterate. In other words: throw enough shit against the
wall and see what sticks.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is very different. It is different by design. It is different
out of necessity. As Satoshi pointed out, e-currency has been tried
many times before, and all previous attempts have failed because there
was a head which could be cut off. The novelty of Bitcoin is that it is
a beast without heads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A lot of people automatically dismiss e-currency as a lost cause
because of all the companies that failed since the 1990’s. I hope it’s
obvious it was only the centrally controlled nature of those systems
that doomed them.”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One consequence of this radical decentralization is an inherent
resistance to change. “Move fast and break things” does not and will
never work on the Bitcoin base layer. Even if it would be desirable, it
wouldn’t be possible without convincing everyone to change their ways.
That’s distributed consensus. That’s the nature of Bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the
core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of the many paradoxical properties of Bitcoin. We all came
to believe that anything which is software can be changed easily. But
the nature of the beast makes changing it bloody hard.</p>

<p>As Hasu beautifully shows in Unpacking Bitcoin’s Social Contract,
changing the rules of Bitcoin is only possible by proposing a change,
and consequently convincing all users of Bitcoin to adopt this change.
This makes Bitcoin very resilient to change, even though it is software.</p>

<p>This resilience is one of the most important properties of Bitcoin.
Critical software systems have to be antifragile, which is what the
interplay of Bitcoin’s social layer and its technical layer guarantees.
Monetary systems are adversarial by nature, and as we have known for
thousands of years solid foundations are essential in an adversarial
environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The rain came down, the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on
that house; and it didn’t fall, for it was founded on the rock.”
<cite>Matthew 7:24–27</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Arguably, in this parable of the wise and the foolish builders Bitcoin
isn’t the house. It is the rock. Unchangeable, unmoving, providing the
foundation for a new financial system.</p>

<p>Just like geologists, who know that rock formations are always moving
and evolving, one can see that Bitcoin is always moving and evolving as
well. You just have to know where to look and how to look at it.</p>

<p>The introduction of pay to script hash and segregated witness are
proof that Bitcoin’s rules can be changed if enough users are convinced
that adopting said change is to the benefit of the network. The latter
enabled the development of the lightning network, which is one of the
houses being built on Bitcoin’s solid foundation. Future upgrades like
Schnorr signatures will enhance efficiency and privacy, as well as
scripts (read: smart contracts) which will be indistinguishable from
regular transactions thanks to Taproot. Wise builders do indeed build
on solid foundations.</p>

<p>Satoshi wasn’t only a wise builder technologically. He also understood
that it would be necessary to make wise decisions ideologically.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Being open source means anyone can independently review the code. If
it was closed source, nobody could verify the security. I think it’s
essential for a program of this nature to be open source.”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Openness is paramount to security and inherent in open source and the
free software movement. As Satoshi pointed out, secure protocols and the
code which implements them have to be open — there is no security
through obscurity. Another benefit is again related to decentralization:
code which can be run, studied, modified, copied, and distributed freely
ensures that it is spread far and wide.</p>

<p>The radically decentralized nature of Bitcoin is what makes it move
slowly and deliberately. A network of nodes, each run by a sovereign
individual, is inherently resistant to change — malicious or not. With
no way to force updates upon users the only way to introduce changes is
by slowly convincing each and every one of those individuals to adopt a
change. This non-central process of introducing and deploying changes is
what makes the network incredibly resilient to malicious changes. It is
also what makes fixing broken things more difficult than in a
centralized environment, which is why everyone tries not to break things
in the first place.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that moving slowly is one of its features, not a bug.</p>

Lesson 19: Privacy is not dead

<p>If pundits are to believed, privacy has been dead since the 80ies. The
pseudonymous invention of Bitcoin and other events in recent history
show that this is not the case. Privacy is alive, even though it is by
no means easy to escape the surveillance state.</p>

<p>Satoshi went through great lengths to cover up his tracks and conceal
his identity. Ten years later, it is still unknown if Satoshi Nakamoto
was a single person, a group of people, male, female, or a
time-traveling AI which bootstrapped itself to take over the world.
Conspiracy theories aside, Satoshi chose to identify himself to be a
Japanese male, which is why I don’t assume but respect his chosen gender
and refer to him as he.</p>



  ♦


  I am not Dorian Nakamoto.



<p>Whatever his real identity might be, Satoshi was successful in hiding
it. He set an encouraging example for everyone who wishes to remain
anonymous: it is possible to have privacy online.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems are one
of the few things that you can rely on.”
<cite>Edward Snowden</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Satoshi wasn’t the first pseudonymous or anonymous inventor, and he
won’t be the last. Some have directly imitated this pseudonymous
publication style, like Tom Elvis Yedusor of MimbleWimble fame, while
others have published advanced mathematical proofs while remaining
completely anonymous.</p>

<p>It is a strange new world we are living in. A world where identity is
optional, contributions are accepted based on merit, and people can
collaborate and transact freely. It will take some adjustment to get
comfortable with these new paradigms, but I strongly believe that all of
this has the potential to change the world for the better.</p>

<p>We should all remember that privacy is a fundamental human right. And
as long as people exercise and defend these rights the battle for
privacy is far from over. Bitcoin taught me that privacy is not dead.</p>

Lesson 20: Cypherpunks write code

<p>Like many great ideas, Bitcoin didn’t come out of nowhere. It was made
possible by utilizing and combining many innovations and discoveries in
mathematics, physics, computer science, and other fields. While
undoubtedly a genius, Satoshi wouldn’t have been able to invent Bitcoin
without the giants on whose shoulders he was standing on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He who only wishes and hopes does not interfere actively with the
course of events and with the shaping of his own destiny.”
<cite>Ludwig Von Mises</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of these giants is Eric Hughes, one of the founders of the
cypherpunk movement and author of the cypherpunk manifesto. It’s hard
to imagine that Satoshi wasn’t influenced by this manifesto. It speaks
of many things which Bitcoin enables and utilizes, such as direct and
private transactions, electronic money and cash, anonymous systems, and
defending privacy with cryptography and digital signatures.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age.
[…] Since we desire privacy, we must ensure that each party to a
transaction have knowledge only of that which is directly necessary
for that transaction. […]</p>

  <p>Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction
systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An
anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system.
[…]</p>

  <p>We the Cypherpunks are dedicated to building anonymous systems. We are
defending our privacy with cryptography, with anonymous mail
forwarding systems, with digital signatures, and with electronic
money.</p>

  <p>Cypherpunks write code.”
<cite>Eric Hughes</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cypherpunks do not find comfort in hopes and wishes. They actively
interfere with the course of events and shape their own destiny.
Cypherpunks write code.</p>

<p>Thus, in true cypherpunk fashion, Satoshi sat down and started to write
code. Code which took an abstract idea and proved to the world that it
actually worked. Code which planted the seed of a new economic reality.
Thanks to this code, everyone can verify that this novel system actually
works, and every 10 minutes or so Bitcoin proofs to the world that it is
still living.</p>



  ♦


  Code excerpts from Bitcoin version 0.1.0



<p>To make sure that his innovation transcends fantasy and becomes reality,
Satoshi wrote code to implement his idea before he wrote the whitepaper.
He also made sure not to delay any release forever. After all,
“there’s always going to be one more thing to do.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I
could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper.”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In today’s world of endless promises and doubtful execution, an exercise
in dedicated building was desperately needed. Be deliberate, convince
yourself that you can actually solve the problems, and implement the
solutions. We should all aim to be a bit more cypherpunk.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that cypherpunks write code.</p>

Lesson 21: Metaphors for Bitcoin’s future

<p>In the last couple of decades, it became apparent that technological
innovation does not follow a linear trend. Whether you believe in the
technological singularity or not, it is undeniable that progress is
exponential in many fields. Not only that, but the rate at which
technologies are being adopted is accelerating, and before you know it
the bush in the local schoolyard is gone and your kids are using
Snapchat instead. Exponential curves have the tendency to slap you in
the face way before you see them coming.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is an exponential technology built upon exponential
technologies. Our World in Data beautifully shows the rising speed of
technological adoption, starting in 1903 with the introduction of
landlines. Landlines, electricity, computers, the internet, smartphones;
all follow exponential trends in price-performance and adoption. Bitcoin
does too.</p>



  ♦


  Bitcoin is literally off the charts.



<p>Bitcoin has not one but multiple network effects, all of which
resulting in exponential growth patterns in their respective area:
price, users, security, developers, market share, and adoption as global
money.</p>

<p>Having survived its infancy, Bitcoin is continuing to grow every day in
more aspects than one. Granted, the technology has not reached maturity
yet. It might be in its adolescence. But if the technology is
exponential, the path from obscurity to ubiquity is short.</p>

  Mobile phone, ca 1965 vs 2019.



<p>In his 2003 TED talk, Jeff Bezos chose to use electricity as a
metaphor for the web’s future. All three phenomena — electricity, the
internet, Bitcoin — are enabling technologies, networks which enable
other things. They are infrastructure to be built upon, foundational in
nature.</p>

<p>Electricity has been around for a while now. We take it for granted. The
internet is quite a bit younger, but most people already take it for
granted as well. Bitcoin is ten years old and has entered public
consciousness during the last hype cycle. Only the earliest of adopters
take it for granted. As more time passes, more and more people will
recognize Bitcoin as something which simply is.</p>

<p>In 1994, the internet was still confusing and unintuitive. Watching this
old recording of the Today Show makes it obvious that what feels
natural and intuitive now actually wasn’t back then. Bitcoin is still
confusing and alien to most, but just like the internet is second nature
for digital natives, spending and stacking sats will be second nature
to the bitcoin natives of the future.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The future is already here — it’s just not very evenly
distributed.”
<cite>William Gibson</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1995, about 15% of American adults used the internet. Historical
data from the Pew Research Center shows how the internet has woven
itself into all our lives. According to a consumer survey by Kaspersky
Lab, 13% of respondents have used Bitcoin and its clones to pay for
goods in 2018. While payments aren’t the only use-case of bitcoin, it is
some indication of where we are in Internet time: in the early- to
mid-90s.</p>

<p>In 1997, Jeff Bezos stated in a letter to shareholders that “this is
Day 1 for the Internet,” recognizing the great untapped potential for
the internet and, by extension, his company. Whatever day this is for
Bitcoin, the vast amounts of untapped potential are clear to all but the
most casual observer.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s first node went online in 2009 after Satoshi mined the
genesis block and released the software into the wild. His node wasn’t
alone for long. Hal Finney was one of the first people to pick up on the
idea and join the network. Ten years later, as of this writing, more
than 10.000 nodes are running bitcoin.</p>

<p>The protocol’s base layer isn’t the only thing growing exponentially.
The lightning network, a second layer technology, is growing at an even
faster rate.</p>

<p>In January 2018, the lightning network had 40 nodes and 60 channels.
In April 2019, the network grew to more than 4000 nodes and around
40.000 channels. Keep in mind that this is still experimental technology
where loss of funds can and does occur. Yet the trend is clear:
thousands of people are reckless and eager to use it.</p>

<p>To me, having lived through the meteoric rise of the web, the parallels
between the internet and Bitcoin are obvious. Both are networks, both
are exponential technologies, and both enable new possibilities, new
industries, new ways of life. Just like electricity was the best
metaphor to understand where the internet is heading, the internet might
be the best metaphor to understand where bitcoin is heading. Or, in the
words of Andreas Antonopoulos, Bitcoin is The Internet of Money.
These metaphors are a great reminder that while history doesn’t repeat
itself, it often rhymes.</p>

<p>Exponential technologies are hard to grasp and often underestimated.
Even though I have a great interest in such technologies, I am
constantly surprised by the pace of progress and innovation. Watching
the Bitcoin ecosystem grow is like watching the rise of the internet in
fast-forward. It is exhilarating.</p>

<p>My quest of trying to make sense of Bitcoin has led me down the pathways
of history in more ways than one. Understanding ancient societal
structures, past monies, and how communication networks evolved were all
part of the journey. From the handaxe to the smartphone, technology has
undoubtedly changed our world many times over. Networked technologies
are especially transformational: writing, roads, electricity, the
internet. All of them changed the world. Bitcoin has changed mine and
will continue to change the minds and hearts of those who dare to use
it.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that understanding the past is essential to
understanding its future. A future which is just beginning.</p>



Conclusion

<p>Technology is all about the application of scientific knowledge to solve
problems in the real world. Every technology has to make tradeoffs in
terms of efficiency, cost, security, and many other properties. Just
like there is no perfect solution to deriving a square from a circle,
any solution to the problems which Bitcoin tries to solve will always be
imperfect as well.</p>

<p>Da Vinci tried to solve the intractable problem of squaring a circle
with the Vitruvian Man, which places a human right at the center of
it. Bitcoin tries to solve the double spending problem with sovereign
individuals, which places humans behind each node, effectively removing
any concept of a center.</p>

<p>Bitcoin’s headless nature shows us that seemingly simple concepts like
creating accounts and agreeing on time require creative solutions in
decentralized systems. It also shows that such systems can be
astonishingly antifragile. How do you best kill something if the best
point of attack is everywhere?</p>

<p>Even with all its quirks and seeming shortcomings, Bitcoin undoubtedly
works. It keeps producing blocks roughly every ten minutes and does so
beautifully. The longer Bitcoin continues to work, the more people will
opt-in to use it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s true that things are beautiful when they work. Art is function.”
<cite>Giannina Braschi</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin is growing exponentially, blurring the line between disciplines.
It isn’t clear where the realm of pure technology ends and where another
realm begins. I tried to differentiate the economic teachings of Bitcoin
from the philosophical and the technological ones, which turned out
more difficult than expected.</p>

<p>Just like in biological systems, removing one part seems to affect the
whole. Maybe the most important lesson is that Bitcoin should be
examined holistically, from multiple angles, if one would like to have a
complete picture. Just like removing one part from Bitcoin destroys the
whole (*cough* blockchain *cough*), examining parts of Bitcoin
in isolation seems to taint the understanding of the whole system.</p>

<p>My journey continues, and as mentioned in part one, I think that any
answer to the question “What have you learned from Bitcoin?” will
always be incomplete. In any case, I’ve learned that the philosophy,
economics, and technology of Bitcoin interact in a complex feedback
loop, and I hope that these 21 lessons are just the beginning of what
I’ve learned from Bitcoin.</p>

  ♦<p>Wednesday, January 3rd, 2029</p><p>It is the year 2029, and Bitcoin is finally no longer a teenager. The price has reached another new high of $420,000, climbing in a surprisingly stable fashion since the 2020 halving. Bitcoin’s market cap exceeds that of gold, and almost 10% of the World’s 6 billion adults are now actively using and buying Bitcoin on a regular basis. There has been huge growth in developing markets thanks to online microtransactions on Bitcoin’s 2nd, 3rd and experimental 4th layer.</p><p>We are in Bitcoin’s 6th reward era, and only 225 bitcoins are being mined per day, meaning that miners are only making the equivalent of $80 million per day in rewards (almost $30bn per year). The ecosystem is healthy though, with blocks on the layer 1 chain being full 24/7. This results in the equivalent of $20 million in daily fees ($7.5bn/yr) for critical, high value, layer 1 transactions. Transactions on the 2nd, 3rd, and experimental 4th layer number in the trillions per year, thanks to online &amp; IoT device micropayments — but the true quantity is impossible to know due to inherent privacy controls.</p><p>The entire layer 1 blockchain is only 700 gigs — so anyone can carry around a hardware wallet full node on their keychain with a RasPi nano set-up. Most device makers generally ship their mid-range and flagship models with a full node with an up to date blockchain — so a 2nd device on your keychain won’t be needed for most. Regardless, don’t trust, verify, and download a fresh copy, even if it’s a painful few hour sync on your 5G data plan.</p><p>So. $420,000. How did price get this high?</p><p>The May 2020 halving breathed life back into bitcoin after the $3000 post-2017-bubble lows, with Christmas 2020 seeing a price of $10,000. People who were new to Bitcoin began to hear about it again, and having now learned from history, took a slow and steady approach. A new movement was beginning to brew. Bitcoin had finally won “the battle of hearts”, and by the end of 2021, many were seeing the economic justice that Bitcoin could deliver to the 3rd world through microtransactions on Bitcoin’s 2nd layer. People were starting to realise that social justice could only be won through economic justice, and economic justice could only be won through Bitcoin, and not by politicians and centralised legacy systems and frameworks. “The many” came together, and it was beautiful.</p><p>From there, the relatively (very) wealthy people of the West started to see Bitcoin as both a charity and a savings mechanism, whereby merely making weekly purchases of Bitcoin and saving would provide price stability to merchants, those in the third world, and anyone else participating on the network. Back then, you could literally become rich while helping the poor build unconfiscatable, uninflatable wealth. The truly passionate Bitcoin believers considered this purchase a “tithe”, religiously saving 1–10% of their weekly income in Bitcoin. They deemed the payment necessary to enable the furthering of Bitcoin’s impact, and they proved to be correct with the benefit of hindsight. Their sacrifices and faith were greatly rewarded however.</p><p>With millions of people saving an average of $5 per day in Bitcoin, the price then found a hard floor, which started to tilt upwards as more people looked to tithing Bitcoin as a means to have greater social &amp; economic impact. With the price now stable enough for online merchants to accept and hold bitcoin, there was no turning back. More than half a decade on, there are now tens of millions saving an average of $5 per day.</p><p>Although the capacity of the lightning network back in 2022 was only around $100 million across 20,000 nodes in 100,000 channels, it was more than enough to start bootstrapping these circular microeconomies. Since people didn’t have to rush to fiat, and were incentivised by both steady capital growth alongside benefits of privacy, fraud &amp; charge back protection, major fee savings, they were happy to offer discounts for Bitcoin and Lightning payments. This further encouraged people to regularly save in Bitcoin and use it to purchase from merchants and content creators, closing up the loop. The loop was further supported through the sacrifices and faith of The Tithers. We have since passed one million lightning nodes, with the lightning network now having a capacity of $50 billion, easily enough to facilitate all of the world’s transactions below $1,000. The cost of a keyring sized USB hardware wallet node is now only $50, so it’ll get even quicker, more reliable and more decentralized in the future.</p><p>The plummeting cost of renewable energy has meant that the industrial bitcoin mining sector, which comprises about 70% of the bitcoin hash rate, split amongst 10 major mining pools, is running on 100% renewable power — not because it is the right moral choice, but the right economic one. The other 30% of hash power comes from the world’s 100+ billion smart and IoT devices all contributing hashing power through micro-mining, since it became possible to apportion rewards in the thousands and millionths of cents since 2022 via Lightning mining pools. All of that said, bitcoin mining now chews through roughly 1% of the world’s entire energy supply. Since Bitcoin is effectively monetised energy, you could theoretically value the sum of the World’s energy, or monetised wealth, at $800 trillion (i.e. $8trn market cap divided by 1%) — which doesn’t seem too crazy in 2029.</p><p>Happy 20th birthday Bitcoin — your resilience and impact have proven to be tremendous. It turns out the BIS’s fears about the collapse of Proof of Work and mining reward incentives should have been aimed at moral citizens choosing to simply opt out of their legacy system at very little cost or effort.</p>♦<p>Bitcoin Celebrates its 20th Birthday with a New High was originally published in Noteworthy - The Journal Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  Bitcoin Mining Competitive Economics 101 — The Oversimplified Version<p>To understand how to quantify the cost and sustainability of Bitcoin, we must understand what makes a miner tick. The following is a 4-layers deep, overly-simplified, intro to Bitcoin Mining Economics and miner decision-making. This piece will be completely unreferenced, with all data and references coming from my in-depth “Cost &amp; Sustainability of Bitcoin (August 2018 Edition)” — which was broken down in these 3 earlier medium posts:</p><ul><li>The Cost &amp; Sustainability of Bitcoin — Part III — Bitcoin Macroeconomics (6 min read)</li><li>The Cost &amp; Sustainability of Bitcoin — Part IV — Perfect Competition &amp; Microeconomics (7 min read)</li><li>The Cost &amp; Sustainability of Bitcoin — Part V — Perfect Competition &amp; Managerial Economics (5 min read)</li></ul>♦(image courtesy Cryptocurrency360.com/)Layer 1 — The Global (Legacy) Macroeconomy<p>Macroeconomics looks at the wider economy at the national and global level, such as monetary policy, interest rates, taxes &amp; duties, trade policies, inflation, unemployment and the like. Although a Bitcoin miner can’t affect Macroeconomics, they can still benefit from it, or be jeopardized by it. Some examples of macroeconomics affecting CEO decision-making are offshoring for tax or regulatory reasons, moving to countries with high unemployment to benefit from cheaper labour, and so on. Bitcoin has its own self-regulating monetary policy which isolates it from the legacy macroeconomy</p><p>In this context, the “Macroeconomy” is all economic activity occurring on the planet.</p>Layer 2 — The Crypto Macroeconomy<p>The Crypto Macroeconomy is a subset of the Global Macroeconomy. This is the sum of all “crypto-economic” activity occurring globally. This includes all miners, product and service providers.</p><p>In the highly competitive-yet-collaborative, largely open-sourced and decentralized crypto macroeconomy, anyone can collaborate with others or create new or copycat ecosystems, ensuring evolution and adaption to changing market needs.</p><p>Here, Bitcoin miners need to keep an eye towards alternative digital ecosystems that are gaining traction in the wider free market, and whether their mining equipment can also mine these alternative digital currencies, or even potentially put them out of business.</p>Layer 3 –Bitcoin Microeconomics<p>The theory of Perfect Competition is just that, a theory. Although it is not seen in the real world, it is taught in all introductory economics courses due to its intuitive, survival-of-the-fittest nature. If you understand nature and evolution, you understand perfect competition. The reason perfect competition hasn’t been seen in the real world (yet) is because of rules, regulations and tangible and intangible externalities. I believe that Bitcoin mining’s “end-game” microeconomic model will be the first real-world case of Perfect Competition.</p><p>A perfectly competitive market can typically be defined by the following 9 conditions:</p>♦<p>Bitcoin is not perfectly competitive in its current state but is very close to becoming so. The first six of the above conditions are met in the short-term, with the last three destined to be met (if not already partially met). In Perfect Competition, economic profit tends to zero in long-term equilibrium, and the marginal cost of producing and the market price constantly oscillate around an equilibrium point, with cost and/or innovation leadership the only way to stay in business</p>Layer 4 — Bitcoin Managerial Economics (Or, Micro-microeconomics)<p>The Porter’s Five (or Six) Forces framework is a mainstay of the MBA Curriculum. The forces within the Bitcoin mining market are illustrated below.</p>♦The Porter’s 6 Forces within the Bitcoin Mining Industry<p>Mapped out, prospects look quite daunting for a miner. They cannot easily protect themselves from new miners or substitute products such as other digital currencies. They are price takers with little power over their buyers (i.e. everyone), or suppliers (i.e. utilities, silicon fabs, shipping companies, etc.). In such competitive markets, there is also a natural tendency for the market to be dominated by three or four players. This is consistently reflected in the mining pool stats</p>♦Bitcoin Mining Pools as at January 16, 2019<p>In a perfectly competitive market, a firm’s decisions are predictable. All firms need to decide to start up, how to run their business as cost-effectively as possible, and whether to stay in business or not. In the Bitcoin world, the decision-making process relies on market price of bitcoin, operating expenditure, and the network hash rate, i.e., how much competing mining power exists on the network. It also indirectly relies on the continued faith and investment of miners in the value of their commodity i.e. continued research, development, capital expenditure, and strategic partnerships with collaborators. The table below shows the relationship between hash rate and price and shows the outcomes for miners in six different scenarios.</p>♦<p>The above logic applies to the workings of physical commodity miners in traditional industries. The difference is that a Bitcoin firm’s decisions take hours and days to implement, and days and weeks to take effect, instead of months and years. The same is true regarding the time taken to reach equilibrium after a price shock; “two-to-four times the duration of the production-to-storage cycle” (i.e. months to years) for commodities, 4 to 8 weeks for Bitcoin.</p>Trends &amp; the Future<p>Since the future appears full of opportunities for the digital macroeconomy, one should expect digital microeconomies to become more perfectly competitive as time passes. Should long amounts of time, say, 50 years pass, when all bitcoins have effectively been mined, and the ecosystem is still healthy and has entered the redistribution stage, microeconomies such as the bitcoin mining market will start to resemble the textbook examples of perfect competition. In time, miners will vertically integrate backwards by acquiring data centres, chip fabricators, research-and-development teams, and renewable power plants; and integrate forwards by acquiring exchanges, brokers, and other places to sell what they have mined. They can horizontally integrate by acquiring entities that enrich the value of their commodity such as wallet hardware and other product manufacturers, financial services companies, and media outlets. 80% of the market will be controlled by the 20% of the largest and most integrated market participants, with the other 80% providing the niche and evolving needs of the market. As time goes on, the makeup of the microeconomy will evolve until its extinction and replacement.</p><p>Now that you have a very thorough understanding of the introductory economics and what is going through a miner’s mind, you’re ready to analyse cost and sustainability!</p>♦

  <p>Money doesn’t grow on trees. To believe that it does is foolish, and our
parents make sure that we know about that by repeating this saying like a
mantra. We are encouraged to use money wisely, to not spend it frivolously,
and to save it in good times to help us through the bad. Money, after all,
does not grow on trees.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me more about money than I ever thought I would need to know.
Through it, I was forced to explore the history of money, banking, various
schools of economic thought, and many other things. The quest to understand
Bitcoin lead me down a plethora of paths, some of which I try to explore in
this series. This is the second of three parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Philosophical Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
  <li>Economic Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
  <li>Technological Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
</ol>

<p>In Part I of this series, some of the philosophical questions Bitcoin touches
on were discussed. Part II will take a closer look at money and economics.
Again, I will only be able to scratch the surface. Bitcoin is not only
ambitious, but also broad and deep in scope, making it impossible to cover
all relevant topics in a single essay, article, or book. I am starting to
doubt if it is even possible at all.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a child of many disciplines. Being a new form of money, learning
about economics is paramount in understanding it. Dealing with the nature of
human action and the interactions of economic agents, economics is probably
one of the largest and fuzziest pieces of the Bitcoin puzzle.</p>

  Blind monks examining Bitcoin



<p>Like the first part, this essay is an exploration of the various things I have
learned from Bitcoin. And just like the first part, it is a personal reflection
of my journey down the rabbit hole. Having no background in economics, I am
definitely out of my comfort zone and aware that any understanding I might
have is incomplete. Like blind monks examining an elephant, everyone who
approaches this novel technology does so from a different angle and will come
to different conclusions. Blindfolded as I am, I will try to outline what I
have learned, even at the risk of making a fool out of myself. After all, I am
still trying to answer the question:</p>

<p>“What have you learned from Bitcoin?”</p>

<p>After seven lessons examined through the lens of philosophy, let’s use the
lens of economics to look at seven more. I hope that you will find the world
of Bitcoin as educational, fascinating and entertaining as I did and still do.
In any case, hop on and enjoy the ride. Economy class is all I can offer this
time. Final destination: sound money.</p>

Lesson 8: Financial Ignorance

<p>One of the most surprising things, to me, was the amount of finance,
economics, and psychology required to get a grasp of what at first
glance seems to be a purely technical system — a computer network.
To paraphrase a little guy with hairy feet: “It’s a dangerous business,
Frodo, stepping into Bitcoin. You read the whitepaper, and if you don’t
keep your feet, there’s no knowing where you might be swept off to.”</p>

<p>To understand a new monetary system, you have to get acquainted with the
old one. I began to realize very soon that the amount of financial
education I enjoyed in the educational system was essentially zero.</p>

<p>Like a five-year-old, I began to ask myself a lot of questions: How does
the banking system work? How does the stock market work? What is fiat
money? What is regular money? Why is there so much debt? How much
money is actually printed, and who decides that?</p>

<p>After a mild panic about the sheer scope of my ignorance, I found
reassurance in realizing that I was in good company.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Isn’t it ironic that Bitcoin has taught me more about money than all
these years I’ve spent working for financial
institutions? …including starting my career at a central
bank”
<cite>aarontaycc</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve learned more about finance, economics, technology, cryptography,
human psychology, politics, game theory, legislation, and myself in
the last three months of crypto than the last three and a half years
of college” 
<cite>bitcoindunny</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are just two of the many confessions all over twitter. Bitcoin,
as was explored in part one, is a living thing. Mises argued that
economics also is a living thing. And as we all know from personal
experience, living things are inherently difficult to understand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A scientific system is but one station in an endlessly progressing
search for knowledge. It is necessarily affected by the insufficiency
inherent in every human effort. But to acknowledge these facts does
not mean that present-day economics is backward. It merely means that
economics is a living thing — and to live implies both imperfection
and change.”
<cite>Ludwig von Mises</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all read about various financial crises in the news, wonder about how
these big bailouts work and are puzzled over the fact that no one ever
seems to be held accountable for damages which are in the trillions. I
am still puzzled, but at least I am starting to get a glimpse of what is
going on in the world of finance.</p>

<p>Some people even go as far as to attribute the general ignorance on
these topics to systemic, willful ignorance. While history, physics,
biology, math, and languages are all part of our education, the world of
money and finance surprisingly is only explored superficially, if at
all. I wonder if people would still be willing to accrue as much debt as
they currently do if everyone would be educated in personal finance and
the workings of money and debt. Then I wonder how many layers of
aluminum make an effective tinfoil hat. Probably three.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Those crashes, these bailouts, are not accidents. And neither is it
an accident that there is no financial education in school. […]
It’s premeditated. Just as prior to the Civil War it was illegal to
educate a slave, we are not allowed to learn about money in school.”
<cite>Robert Kiyosaki</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like in The Wizard of Oz, we are told to pay no attention to the man
behind the curtain. Unlike in The Wizard of Oz, we now have real
wizardry: a censorship-resistant, open, borderless network of
value-transfer. There is no curtain, and the magic is visible to
anyone.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me to look behind the curtain and face my financial
ignorance.</p>

Lesson 9: Inflation

<p>Trying to understand monetary inflation, and how a non-inflationary
system like Bitcoin might change how we do things, was the starting
point of my venture into economics. I knew that inflation was the rate
at which new money was created, but I didn’t know too much beyond that.</p>

<p>While some economists argue that inflation is a good thing, others argue
that “hard” money which can’t be inflated easily —as we had in the
days of the gold standard — is essential for a healthy economy.
Bitcoin, having a fixed supply of 21 million, agrees with the latter
camp.</p>

<p>Usually, the effects of inflation are not immediately obvious. Depending
on the inflation rate (as well as other factors) the time between cause
and effect can be several years. Not only that, but inflation affects
different groups of people more than others. As Henry Hazlitt points out
in Economics in One Lesson: “The art of economics consists in looking
not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act or
policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not
merely for one group but for all groups.”</p>

<p>One of my personal lightbulb moments was the realization that issuing
new currency — printing more money — is a completely different
economic activity than all the other economic activities. While real
goods and real services produce real value for real people, printing
money effectively does the opposite: it takes away value from everyone
who holds the currency which is being inflated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Mere inflation — that is, the mere issuance of more money, with the
consequence of higher wages and prices — may look like the creation
of more demand. But in terms of the actual production and exchange of
real things it is not.”
<cite>Henry Hazlitt</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The destructive force of inflation becomes obvious as soon as a little
inflation turns into a lot. If money hyperinflates, things get ugly
real quick. As the inflating currency falls apart, it will fail to store
value over time and people will rush to get their hands on any goods
which might do.</p>

<p>Another consequence of hyperinflation is that all the money which people
have saved over the course of their life will effectively vanish. The
paper money in your wallet will still be there, of course. But it will
be exactly that: worthless paper.</p>

  Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic (1921-1923)



<p>Money declines in value with so-called “mild” inflation as well. It
just happens slowly enough that most people don’t notice the diminishing
of their purchasing power. And once the printing presses are running,
currency can be easily inflated, and what used to be mild inflation
might turn into a strong cup of inflation by the push of a button. As
Friedrich Hayek pointed out in one of his essays, mild inflation usually
leads to outright inflation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"”Mild” steady inflation cannot help — it can lead only to outright
inflation.”
<cite>Friedrich Hayek</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Inflation is particularly devious since it favors those who are closer
to the printing presses. It takes time for the newly created money to
circulate and prices to adjust, so if you are able to get your hands on
more money before everyone else’s devaluates you are ahead of the
inflationary curve. This is also why inflation can be seen as a hidden
tax because in the end governments profit from it while everyone else
ends up paying the price.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I do not think it is an exaggeration to say history is largely a
history of inflation, and usually of inflations engineered by
governments for the gain of governments.”
<cite>Friedrich Hayek</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, all government-controlled currencies have eventually been
replaced or have collapsed completely. No matter how small the rate of
inflation, “steady” growth is just another way of saying exponential
growth. In nature as in economics, all systems which grow exponentially
will eventually have to level off or suffer from catastrophic collapse.</p>

<p>“It can’t happen in my country,” is what you’re probably thinking. You
don’t think that if you are from Venezuela, which is currently
suffering from hyperinflation. With an inflation rate of over 1 million
percent, money is basically worthless.</p>

<p>It might not happen in the next couple of years, or to the particular
currency used in your country. But a glance at the list of historical
currencies shows that it will inevitably happen over a long enough period of
time. I remember and used plenty of those listed: the Austrian
schilling, the German mark, the Italian lira, the French franc, the
Irish pound, the Croatian dinar, etc. My grandma even used the
Austro-Hungarian Krone. As time moves on, the currencies currently in
use will slowly but surely move to their respective graveyards. They
will hyperinflate or be replaced. They will soon be historical
currencies. We will make them obsolete.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“History has shown that governments will inevitably succumb to the
temptation of inflating the money supply.”
<cite>Saifedean Ammous</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is Bitcoin different? In contrast to currencies mandated by the
government, monetary goods which are not regulated by governments, but
by the laws of physics, tend to survive and even hold their respective
value over time. The best example of this so far is gold, which, as the
aptly-named Gold-to-Decent-Suit Ratio shows, is holding its value
over hundreds and even thousands of years. It might not be perfectly
“stable” — a questionable concept in the first place — but the value
it holds will at least be in the same order of magnitude.</p>

<p>If a monetary good or currency holds its value well over time and space,
it is considered to be hard. If it can’t hold its value, because it
easily deteriorates or inflates, it is considered a soft currency. The
concept of hardness is essential to understand Bitcoin and is worthy of
a more thorough examination. We will return to it in the last economic
lesson: sound money.</p>

<p>As more and more countries suffer from hyperinflation,
more and more people will have to face the reality of hard and soft
money. If we are lucky, maybe even some central bankers will be forced
to re-evaluate their monetary policies. Whatever might happen, the
insights I have gained thanks to Bitcoin will probably be invaluable, no
matter the outcome.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me about the hidden tax of inflation and the catastrophe
of hyperinflation.</p>

Lesson 10: Value

<p>Value is somewhat paradoxical, and there are multiple theories which
try to explain why we value certain things over other things. People
have been aware of this paradox for thousands of years. As Plato wrote
in his dialogue with Euthydemus, we value some things because they are
rare, and not merely based on their necessity for our survival.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And if you are prudent you will give this same counsel to your pupils
also — that they are never to converse with anybody except you and
each other. For it is the rare, Euthydemus, that is precious, while
water is cheapest, though best, as Pindar said.”
<cite>Plato</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This paradox of value shows something interesting about us humans: we
seem to value things on a subjective basis, but do so with certain
non-arbitrary criteria. Something might be precious to us for a
variety of reasons, but things we value do share certain
characteristics. If we can copy something very easily, or if it is
naturally abundant, we do not value it.</p>

<p>It seems that we value something because it is scarce (gold, diamonds,
time), difficult or labor-intensive to produce, can’t be replaced (an
old photograph of a loved one), is useful in a way in which it enables
us to do things which we otherwise couldn’t, or a combination of those,
such as great works of art.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is all of the above: it is extremely rare (21 million),
increasingly hard to produce (reward halvening), can’t be replaced (a
lost private key is lost forever), and enables us to do some quite
useful things. It is arguably the best tool for value transfer across
borders, virtually resistant to censorship and confiscation in the
process, plus, it is a self-sovereign store of value, allowing
individuals to store their wealth independent of banks and governments,
just to name two.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that value is subjective but not arbitrary.</p>

Lesson 11: Money

<p>What is money? We use it every day, yet this question is surprisingly
difficult to answer. We are dependent on it in ways big and small, and
if we have too little of it our lives become very difficult. Yet, we
seldom think about the thing which supposedly makes the world go round.
Bitcoin forced me to answer this question over and over again: What the
hell is money?</p>

<p>In our “modern” world, most people will probably think of pieces of
paper when they talk about money, even though most of our money is just
a number in a bank account. We are already using zeros and ones as our
money, so how is Bitcoin different? Bitcoin is different because at its
core it is a very different type of money than the money we currently
use. To understand this, we will have to take a closer look at what
money is, how it came to be, and why gold and silver was used for most
of commercial history.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this sense, it’s more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the
supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is
predetermined and the value changes.”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seashells, gold, silver, paper, bitcoin. In the end, money is whatever
people use as money, no matter its shape and form, or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Money, as an invention, is ingenious. A world without money is insanely
complicated: How many fish will buy me new shoes? How many cows will buy
me a house? What if I don’t need anything right now but I need to get
rid of my soon-to-be rotten apples? You don’t need a lot of imagination
to realize that a barter economy is maddeningly inefficient.</p>

<p>The great thing about money is that it can be exchanged for anything
else — that’s quite the invention! As Nick Szabo brilliantly
summarizes in Shelling Out: The Origins of Money, we humans have
used all kinds of things as money: beads made of rare materials like
ivory, shells, or special bones, various kinds of jewelry, and later on
rare metals like silver and gold.</p>

<p>Being the lazy creatures we are, we don’t think too much about things
which just work. Money, for most of us, works just fine. Like with our
cars or our computers, most of us are only forced to think about the
inner workings of these things if they break down. People who saw their
life-savings vanish because of hyperinflation know the value of hard
money, just like people who saw their friends and family vanish because
of the atrocities of Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia know the value of
privacy.</p>

<p>The thing about money is that it is all-encompassing. Money is half of
every transaction, which imbues the ones who are in charge with creating
money with enormous power.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Given that money is one half of every commercial transaction and that
whole civilizations literally rise and fall based on the quality of
their money, we are talking about an awesome power, one that flies
under the cover of night. It is the power to weave illusions that
appear real as long as they last. That is the very core of the
Fed’s power.”
<cite>Ron Paul</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin peacefully removes this power, since it does away with money
creation and it does so without the use of force.</p>

<p>Money went through multiple iterations. Most iterations were good. They
improved our money in one way or another. Very recently, however, the
inner workings of our money got corrupted. Today, almost all of our
money is simply created out of thin air by the powers that be. To
understand how this came to be I had to learn about the history and
subsequent downfall of money.</p>

<p>If it will take a series of catastrophes or simply a monumental
educational effort to correct this corruption remains to be seen. I pray
to the gods of sound money that it will be the latter.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me what money is.</p>

Lesson 12: The history and downfall of money

<p>Many people think that money is backed by gold, which is locked away in
big vaults, protected by thick
walls. This ceased to be true many decades ago. I am not sure what I
thought, since I was in much deeper trouble, having virtually no
understanding of gold, paper money, or why it would need to be backed by
something in the first place.</p>

<p>One part of learning about Bitcoin is learning about fiat money: what it
means, how it came to be, and why it might not be the best idea we ever
had. So, what exactly is fiat money? And how did we end up using it?</p>

<p>If something is imposed by fiat, it simply means that it is imposed by
formal authorization or proposition. Thus, fiat money is money simply
because someone says that it is money. Since all governments use fiat
currency today, this someone is your government. Unfortunately, you
are not free to disagree with this value proposition. You will quickly
feel that this proposition is everything but non-violent. If you refuse
to use this paper currency to do business and pay taxes the only people
you will be able to discuss economics with will be your cellmates.</p>

<p>The value of fiat money does not stem from its inherent properties. How
good a certain type of fiat money is, is only correlated to the
political and fiscal (in)stability of those who dream it into existence.
Its value is imposed by decree, arbitrarily.</p>

  fi·at /ˈfēˌät,ˈfēət/ --- 'Let it be done'



<p>Until recently, two types of money were used: commodity money, made
out of precious things, and representative money, which simply
represents the precious thing, mostly in writing.</p>

<p>We already touched on commodity money above. People used special bones,
seashells, and precious metals as money. Later on, mainly coins made out
of precious metals like gold and silver were used as money. The oldest
coin found so far is made of a natural gold-and-silver mix and was made
more than 2700 years ago. If something is new in Bitcoin, the concept of
a coin is not it.</p>



  ♦


  Lydian electrum coin



<p>Turns out that hoarding coins, or hodling, to use today’s parlance, is
almost as old as coins. The earliest coin hodler was someone who put
almost a hundred of these coins in a pot and buried it in the
foundations of a temple, only to be found 2500 years later. Pretty good
cold storage if you ask me.</p>

<p>One of the downsides of using precious metal coins is that they can be
clipped, effectively debasing the value of the coin. New coins can be
minted from the clippings, inflating the money supply over time,
devaluing every individual coin in the process. People were literally
shaving off as much as they could get away with of their silver dollars.
I wonder what kind of Dollar Shave Club advertisements they had back
in the day.</p>

<p>Since governments are only cool with inflation if they are the ones
doing it, efforts were made to stop this guerrilla debasement. In
classic cops-and-robbers fashion, coin clippers got ever more creative
with their techniques, forcing the ‘masters of the mint’ to get even
more creative with their countermeasures. Isaac Newton, the
world-renowned physicist of Principia Mathematica fame, used to be one
of these masters. He is attributed with adding the small stripes at the
side of coins which are still present today. Gone were the days of easy
coin shaving.</p>



  ♦




<p>Even with these methods of coin debasement kept in check, coins still
suffer from other issues. They are bulky and not very convenient to
transport, especially when large transfers of value need to happen.
Showing up with a huge bag of silver dollars every time you want to buy
a Mercedes isn’t very practical.</p>

<p>Speaking of German things: How the United States dollar got its name
is another interesting story. The word “dollar” is derived from the
German word Thaler, short for a Joachimsthaler. A Joachimsthaler
was a coin minted in the town of Sankt Joachimsthal. Thaler is simply
a shorthand for someone (or something) coming from the valley, and
because Joachimsthal was the valley for silver coin production, people
simply referred to these silver coins as Thaler. Thaler (German)
morphed into daalders (Dutch), and finally dollars (English).</p>

<p>The introduction of representative money heralded the downfall of hard
money. Gold certificates were introduced in 1863, and about fifteen
years later, the silver dollar was also slowly but surely being replaced
by a paper proxy: the silver certificate.</p>

<p>It took about 50 years from the introduction of the first silver
certificates until these pieces of paper morphed into something that we
would today recognize as one U.S. dollar.</p>



  ♦

<p>Note that the 1928 U.S. silver dollar above still goes by the name of
silver certificate, indicating that this is indeed simply a document
stating that the bearer of this piece of paper is owed a piece of
silver. It is interesting to see that the text which indicates this got
smaller over time. The trace of “certificate” vanished completely after
a while, being replaced by the reassuring statement that these are
federal reserve notes.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the same thing happened to gold. Most of the world
was on a bimetallic standard, meaning coins were made primarily of
gold and silver. Having certificates for gold, redeemable in gold coins,
was arguably a technological improvement. Paper is more convenient,
lighter, and since it can be divided arbitrarily by simply printing a
smaller number on it, it is easier to break into smaller units.</p>

<p>To remind the bearers (users) that these certificates were
representative for actual gold and silver, they were colored accordingly
and stated this clearly on the certificate itself. You can fluently read
the writing from top to bottom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This certifies that there have been deposited in the treasury of the
United States of America one hundred dollars in gold coin payable to
the bearer on demand.”</p>
</blockquote>



  ♦

<p>In 1963, the words “PAYABLE TO THE BEARER ON DEMAND” were removed from
all newly issued notes. Five years later, the redemption of paper notes
for gold and silver ended.</p>

<p>The words hinting on the origins and the idea behind paper money were
removed. The golden color disappeared. All that was left was the paper
and with it the ability of the government to print as much of it as it
wishes.</p>

<p>With the abolishment of the gold standard in 1971, this century-long
sleight-of-hand was complete. Money became the illusion we all share to
this day: fiat money. It is worth something because someone commanding
an army and operating jails says it is worth something. As can be
clearly read on every dollar note in circulation today, “THIS NOTE IS
LEGAL TENDER”. In other words: It is valuable because the note says so.</p>



  ♦


  A 2004 series U.S. twenty dollar note used today. 'THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER'



<p>By the way, there is another interesting lesson on today’s bank notes,
hidden in plain sight. The second line reads that this is legal tender
“FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE”. What might be obvious to economists
was surprising to me: All money is debt. My head is still hurting
because of it, and I will leave the exploration of the relation of money
and debt as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>As we have seen, gold and silver were used as money for millennia. Over
time, coins made from gold and silver were replaced by paper. Paper
slowly became accepted as payment. This acceptance created an
illusion — the illusion that the paper itself has value. The final
move was to completely sever the link between the representation and the
actual: abolishing the gold standard and convincing everyone that the
paper in itself is precious.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me about the history of money and the greatest sleight of
hand in the history of economics: fiat currency.</p>

Lesson 13: Fractional Reserve Insanity

<p>Value and money aren’t trivial topics, especially in today’s times. The
process of money creation in our banking system is equally non-trivial,
and I can’t shake the feeling that this is deliberately so. What I have
previously only encountered in academia and legal texts seems to be
common practice in the financial world as well: nothing is explained in
simple terms, not because it is truly complex, but because the truth is
hidden behind layers and layers of jargon and apparent complexity.
“Expansionary monetary policy, quantitative easing, fiscal stimulus to
the economy.” The audience nods along in agreement, hypnotized by the
fancy words.</p>

<p>Fractional reserve banking and quantitative easing are two of those
fancy words, obfuscating what is really happening by masking it as
complex and difficult to understand. If you would explain them to a
five-year-old, the insanity of both will become apparent quickly.</p>

<p>Godfrey Bloom, addressing the European Parliament during a joint
debate, said it way better than I ever could:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“[…] you do not really understand the concept of banking. All the
banks are broke. Bank Santander, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of
Scotland — they’re all broke! And why are they broke? It isn’t an
act of God. It isn’t some sort of tsunami. They’re broke because we
have a system called ‘fractional reserve banking’ which means that
banks can lend money that they don’t actually have! It’s a criminal
scandal and it’s been going on for too long. […]</p>

  <p>We have counterfeiting — sometimes called quantitative
easing — but counterfeiting by any other name. The artificial
printing of money which, if any ordinary person did, they’d go to
prison for a very long time […] and until we start sending
bankers — and I include central bankers and politicians — to
prison for this outrage it will continue.”
<cite>Godfrey Bloom</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let me repeat the most important part: banks can lend money that they
don’t actually have.</p>

<p>Thanks to fractional reserve banking, a bank only has to keep a small
fraction of every dollar it gets. It’s somewhere between 0 and 10%,
usually at the lower end, which makes things even worse.</p>

<p>Let’s use a concrete example to better understand this crazy idea: A
fraction of 10% will do the trick and we should be able to do all the
calculations in our head. Win-win. So, if you take $100 to a
bank — because you don’t want to store it under your mattress — they
only have to keep the agreed upon fraction of it. In our example that
would be $10, because 10% of $100 is $10. Easy, right?</p>

<p>So what do banks do with the rest of the money? What happens to your
$90? They do what banks do, they lend it to other people. The result is
a money multiplier effect, which increases the money supply in the
economy enormously. Your initial deposit of $100 will soon turn into
$190. By lending a 90% fraction of the newly created $90, there will
soon be $271 in the economy. And $343.90 after that. The money supply
is recursively increasing, since banks are literally lending money they
don’t have. Without a single Abracadabra, banks magically transform
$100 into one thousand dollars or more. Turns out 10x is easy. It only
takes a couple of lending rounds.</p>



  ♦




<p>Don’t get me wrong: There is nothing wrong with lending. There is
nothing wrong with interest. There isn’t even anything wrong with good
old regular banks to store your wealth somewhere more secure than in
your sock drawer.</p>

<p>Central banks, however, are a different beast. Abominations of financial
regulation, half public half private, playing god with something which
affects everyone who is part of our global civilization, without a
conscience, only interested in the immediate future, and seemingly
without any accountability or auditability.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin is still inflationary, it will cease to be so rather soon.
The strictly limited supply of 21 million bitcoins will eventually do
away with inflation completely. We now have two monetary worlds: an
inflationary one where money is printed arbitrarily, and the world of
Bitcoin, where final supply is fixed and easily auditable for everyone.
One is forced upon us by violence, the other can be joined by anyone who
wishes to do so. No barriers to entry, no one to ask for permission.
Voluntary participation. That is the beauty of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>I would argue that the argument between Keynesian and Austrian
economists is no longer purely academical. Satoshi managed to build a
system for value transfer on steroids, creating the soundest money which
ever existed in the process. One way or another, more and more people
will learn about the scam which is fractional reserve banking. If they
come to similar conclusions as most Austrians and Bitcoiners, they might
join the ever-growing internet of money. Nobody can stop them if they
choose to do so.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that fractional reserve banking is pure insanity.</p>

Lesson 14: Sound money

<p>The most important lesson I have learned from Bitcoin is that in the
long run, hard money is superior to soft money. Hard money, also
referred to as sound money, is any globally traded currency that
serves as a reliable store of value.</p>

<p>Granted, Bitcoin is still young and volatile. Critics will say that it
does not store value reliably. The volatility argument is missing the
point. Volatility is to be expected. The market will take a while to
figure out the just price of this new money. Also, as is often jokingly
pointed out, it is grounded in an error of measurement. If you think in
dollars you will fail to see that one bitcoin will always be worth one
bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A fixed money supply, or a supply altered only in accord with
objective and calculable criteria, is a necessary condition to a
meaningful just price of money.”
<cite>Fr. Bernard W. Dempsey, S.J.</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a quick stroll through the graveyard of forgotten currencies has
shown, money which can be printed will be printed. So far, no human in
history was able to resist this temptation.</p>

<p>Bitcoin does away with the temptation to print money in an ingenious
way. Satoshi was aware of our greed and fallibility — this is why he
chose something more reliable than human restraint: mathematics.</p>



  ♦


  Bitcoin's supply formula



<p>While this formula is useful to describe Bitcoin’s supply, it is
actually nowhere to be found in the code. Issuance of new bitcoin is
done in an algorithmically controlled fashion, by reducing the reward
which is paid to miners every four years. The formula above is used to
quickly sum up what is happening under the hood. What really happens can
be best seen by looking at the change in block reward, the reward paid
out to whoever finds a valid block, which roughly happens every 10
minutes.</p>



  ♦




<p>Formulas, logarithmic functions and exponentials are not exactly
intuitive to understand. The concept of soundness might be easier to
understand if looked at in another way. Once we know how much there is
of something, and once we know how hard this something is to produce or
get our hands on, we immediately understand its value. What is true for
Picasso’s paintings, Elvis Presley’s guitars, and Stradivarius violins
is also true for fiat currency, gold, and bitcoins.</p>

<p>The hardness of fiat currency depends on who is in charge of the
respective printing presses. Some governments might be more willing to
print large amounts of currency than others, resulting in a weaker
currency. Other governments might be more restrictive in their money
printing, resulting in harder currency.</p>

<p>Before we had fiat currencies, the soundness of money was determined by
the natural properties of the stuff which we used as money. The amount
of gold on earth is limited by the laws of physics. Gold is rare because
supernovae and neutron star collisions are rare. The “flow” of gold is
limited because extracting it is quite an effort. Being a heavy element
it is mostly buried deep underground.</p>

<p>The abolishment of the gold standard gave way to a new reality: adding
new money requires just a drop of ink. In our modern world adding a
couple of zeros to the balance of a bank account requires even less
effort: flipping a few bits in a bank computer is enough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One important aspect of this new reality is that institutions like
the Fed cannot go bankrupt. They can print any amount of money that
they might need for themselves at virtually zero cost.”
<cite>Jörg Guido Hülsmann</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The principle outlined above can be expressed more generally as the
ratio of “stock” to “flow”. Simply put, the stock is how much of
something is currently there. For our purposes, the stock is a measure
of the current money supply. The flow is how much there is produced
over a period of time (e.g. per year). The key to understanding sound
money is in understanding this stock-to-flow ratio.</p>

<p>Calculating the stock-to-flow ratio for fiat currency is difficult,
because how much money there is depends on how you look at it. You
could count only banknotes and coins (M0), add traveler checks and check
deposits (M1), add saving accounts and mutual funds and some other
things (M2), and even add certificates of deposit to all of that (M3).
Further, how all of this is defined and measured varies from country to
country and since the US Federal Reserve stopped publishing numbers
for M3, we will have to make do with the M2 monetary supply. I would
love to verify these numbers, but I guess we have to trust the fed for
now.</p>

<p>Gold, one of the rarest metals on earth, has the highest stock-to-flow
ratio. According to the US Geological Survey, a little more than 190,000
tons have been mined. In the last few years, around 3100 tons of gold
have been mined per year.</p>

<p>Using these numbers, we can easily calculate the stock-to-flow ratio for
gold: 190,000 tons / 3,100 tons = ~61.</p>

<p>Nothing has a higher stock-to-flow ratio than gold. This is why gold, up
to now, was the hardest, soundest money in existence. It is often said
that all the gold mined so far would fit in two olympic-sized swimming
pools. According to my calculations, we would need four. So maybe this
needs updating, or Olympic-sized swimming pools got smaller.</p>

<p>Enter Bitcoin. As you probably know, bitcoin mining was all the rage in
the last couple of years. This is because we are still in the early
phases of what is called the reward era, where mining nodes are
rewarded with a lot of bitcoin for their computational effort. We are
currently in reward era number 3, which began in 2016 and will end in
early 2020, probably in May. While the bitcoin supply is predetermined,
the inner workings of Bitcoin only allow for approximate dates.
Nevertheless, we can predict with certainty how high Bitcoin’s
stock-to-flow ratio will be. Spoiler alert: it will be high.</p>

<p>How high? Well, it turns out that Bitcoin will get infinitely hard.</p>



  ♦


  Visualization of stock and flow for USD, gold, and Bitcoin



<p>Due to an exponential decrease of the mining reward, the flow of new
bitcoin will diminish resulting in a sky-rocketing stock-to-flow ratio.
It will catch up to gold in 2020, only to surpass it four years later by
doubling its soundness again. Such a doubling will occur 64 times in
total. Thanks to the power of exponentials, the number of bitcoin mined
per year will drop below 100 bitcoin in 50 years and below 1 bitcoin in
75 years. The global faucet which is the block reward will dry up
somewhere around the year 2140, effectively stopping the production of
bitcoin. This is a long game. If you are reading this, you are still
early.</p>

  Rising stock-to-flow ratio of bitcoin as compared to gold



<p>As bitcoin approaches infinite stock to flow ratio it will be the
soundest money in existence. Infinite soundness is hard to beat.</p>

<p>Viewed through the lens of economics, Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment
is probably its most important component. How hard it is to mine bitcoin
depends on how quickly new bitcoins are mined*. It is the dynamic
adjustment of the network’s mining difficulty which enables us to
predict its future supply.</p>

<p>(* It actually depends on how quickly valid blocks are found, but for
our purposes, this is the same thing as “mining bitcoins” and will be so
for the next 120 years.)</p>

<p>The simplicity of the difficulty adjustment algorithm might distract
from its profundity, but the difficulty adjustment truly is a revolution
of Einsteinian proportions. It ensures that, no matter how much or how
little effort is spent on mining, Bitcoin’s controlled supply won’t be
disrupted. As opposed to every other resource, no matter how much
energy someone will put into mining bitcoin, the total reward will not
increase.</p>

<p>Just like E=mc² dictates the universal speed limit in our universe,
Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment dictates the universal money limit
in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>If it weren’t for this difficulty adjustment, all bitcoins would have
been mined already. If it weren’t for this difficulty adjustment,
Bitcoin probably wouldn’t have survived in its infancy. It is what
secures the network in its reward era. It is what ensures a steady and
fair distribution of new bitcoin. It is the thermostat which regulates
Bitcoin’s monetary policy.</p>

<p>Einstein showed us something novel: no matter how hard you push an
object, at a certain point you won’t be able to get more speed out of
it. Satoshi also showed us something novel: no matter how hard you dig
for this digital gold, at a certain point you won’t be able to get more
bitcoin out of it. For the first time in human history, we have a
monetary good which, no matter how hard you try, you won’t be able to
produce more of.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that me that sound money is essential.</p>



Conclusion

<p>As we leave the “blockchain not bitcoin” days behind us, most people start
to realize that there is not a single invention which encapsulates the
genius of Bitcoin. It is the combination of multiple, previously unrelated
pieces, glued together by game theoretical incentives, which make up the
revolution that is Bitcoin.</p>

<p>For me, the economic teachings of Bitcoin are as fascinating as the
philosophical ones examined in part one. Being a technophile, I can’t wait
to tell you what Bitcoin taught me about technology in the third and final
part of this series.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, I think that any answer to the question “What have you
learned from Bitcoin?” will always be incomplete. The symbiosis of the
two living systems examined here — Bitcoin and economics — is too intertwined
and evolving too fast to ever be fully understood by a single person.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take
the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take it violently
out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way
introduce something that they can’t stop.”
<cite>Friedrich Hayek</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Learning these lessons enabled me to finally understand what Hayek meant by
the above. I believe that Bitcoin is the sly, roundabout way to re-introduce
sound money to the world. Thanks to the economic teachings of Bitcoin I
learned what good money is and that having it is possible.</p>

<p>What have you learned from Bitcoin?</p>

  Calculating Bitcoin’s Energy Use — Accounting for the ASIC Supply Chain<p>In my recent 10-part article series study on The Cost &amp; Sustainability of Bitcoin, I opened with a piece on what my personal interpretation of “Energy” was so that I could set a context for my study. You could also take it as assumed reading (or watching on YouTube on 1.25 speed) so as to keep this piece as short as possible.</p>medium.com/media/1fde5f19a1be36e9359d093b6e2b05da/href<p>I argued that EVERYTHING was “Energy” in one manifestation or another, and I made a firm distinction between money and currency. I also made a distinction with capitalisations, showing that Energy is finite, but infinitely divisible into units of energy, just as Bitcoin is finite but infinitely divisible in units of bitcoin.</p><p>Taking creative liberty with the transitive property of algebra, I argued that Energy = Mass = Nature = Money, Money = Bitcoin, leading to Bitcoin = Energy and Bitcoin = Nature. As you can see, the deeper your philosophical and spiritual views on Energy, Nature, Life and “The way it is”, the quicker you see the unimportance of the energy question. Bitcoin IS Energy. It is the global store of Monetary Energy. It runs as Nature wills.</p><p>But many people do question its energy use, and rightly so. It is an extremely difficult topic and philosophy to learn and understand. A lot of people also attempt to quantify energy use, and many hit the nail on the head in terms of electricity used to run mining rigs. Some even cover the full range of OPEX and include cooling consumption. But few mention CAPEX energy, and the manufacture of ASICs. Money is energy after all…</p>♦<p>From my study, we saw that the manufacture of ASICs was more than half of all energy consumption of the Bitcoin network. This was reflected in the fact that the CAPEX component of the cost to mine is higher than the OPEX component — recall, energy = money, and more money spent on CAPEX means there is more “embedded energy” within the CAPEX. Energy is also mass, and each ASIC is about 7kg of raw material, alongside silicon componentry which requires huge amounts of energy to fabricate.</p><p>Every single thing in the ASIC supply chain costs money (and thereby costs energy) to procure — from the mining of base metals and fossil fuels, shipping, refinement, shipping, production, more shipping, assembly, and final delivery. This is all reflected in the ASIC’s final price. Since you need an ASIC to mine bitcoin, and you need to add to and replace them very frequently, it is only right that the energy (i.e. money) used to obtain them be included in modelling the network’s power use.</p>♦<p>Updating my figures from July 2018, my model demonstrates that miners consume, directly AND indirectly, 100 MWh in total to produce a bitcoin. If you have a look at average power costs around the network of around 4 cents/kWh, this produces $4,000 — which is almost the exact market price of a bitcoin at time of publication. Embedded into this price are the costs and profits of every part of the supply chain, all the way to your wallet. If you see Bitcoin acting as the eventual arbiter of monetary energy value and driver of economic and environmental efficiency, then you will not find this coincidental.</p>♦

  Cost &amp; Sustainability of Bitcoin (Dec 2018) — Executive Summary<p>All data used in this piece is as at Block 556,416 mined on 31 December 2018 (EoY), the 276th Difficulty Change. Network Difficulty was roughly 5.6 trillion. Hash Rate was roughly 40.22 EH/s. Price on the Bitfinex exchange was roughly USD$3,900. The changes in mining ecosystem metrics since the August 2018 edition of this report are shown below:</p>♦<p>This story is an updated and abridged version of my report, “The Cost &amp; Sustainability of Bitcoin (August 2018 Edition)[i]”. The reader is asked to refer to the original paper for detailed references and deeper discussion. Future updates will come in this form, and include updates on methods and assumptions as new data emerges.</p>medium.com/media/1fde5f19a1be36e9359d093b6e2b05da/href<p>Changes to Inputs &amp; Assumptions</p><ul><li>Since my previous report demonstrated that “$/GH is king” due to low electricity prices amongst most large miners, the Antminer T15 will be taken as the proxy benchmark ASIC for this report. It should be noted that the co-released Antminer S15 is 12% more energy efficient than the T15, but 21% more expensive on a $/GH basis.</li><li>Further to the above, the “GH/kg” Manufacturing metric comes in to play, as energy required for manufacturing &amp; shipping ASICs is quite weight-centric. By the end of 2018, weight of material required to produce 1TH dropped 5%, from 300 grams (excl. PSU) to 285 (S9i was net 4.2kg, the T15 net 6.6kg). Using the S15 as a proxy, the ratio drops by 20%. It should be noted that this is the first model of this new generation of ASICs, and the kg/GH metric will improve as chips start getting optimised and overclocked.</li><li>It should be noted that the dramatic drop in price has caused negative hash rate growth over the past 6 months, however, as the price stabilises, so will hash rate growth due to constant improvements in $/GH and W/GH metrics. That said, I will be dropping my difficulty increase assumption from 7.2% to 5.3%, which is more in line with the growth witnessed since the “Age of ASICs” began in 2014/15 (See Table 2 in this linked article)</li><li>It was assumed that the Bitcoin Mining Industry was powered by the “World Average” Energy Grid. Analysis by The University of Cambridge[ii] showed that 28% of the power used to mine Bitcoin is renewable, of which the majority is Hydroelectric. This reduces the average CO2e per kWh from 0.6 tonne/MWh to 0.53 t/MWh</li><li>All other assumptions remain constant</li></ul>♦Changes in Mining Metrics — July to December 2018<p>Based on the changed assumptions outlined above, the model has estimated the average cost to mine one bitcoin to be roughly $3,750. It should be noted that this research is an inductive, bottom-up estimate, with the intent to provide a ball-park estimate. A sensitivity analysis has also been undertaken to demonstrate range of costs under different scenarios, which shows a realistic range of average mining cost of between $3,000 (driven by aggressive electricity price assumptions), and $4,000 (driven by hash rate increase assumptions). Due to the nature of competition in the Bitcoin mining market, costs that are significantly higher than the market price of Bitcoin can generally be ignored in the short term.</p><p>Further, the model has estimated that the Bitcoin Mining Industry exhales 34 million tonnes of CO2 per year — about 0.06% of global greenhouse gas emissions[iii],[iv],[v] (37 Gt CO2 + 16.5 Gt CO2e). Of the 160,000 TWh of energy generated globally each year[vi], the Bitcoin Network chews through about 63 TWh/year (0.04%). It should be noted that all figures include the impact of the ASIC supply-chain, which represents over 50% of all emissions generated.</p>References<p>[i] McCook, H., 2018, “The Cost &amp; Sustainability of Bitcoin (August 2018 Edition)”, goo.gl/FgqRjV</p><p>[ii] Rauchs, M, et al, 2018, “2nd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study”, Cambridge Centre Alternative Finance, www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/fileadmin/user_upload/research/centres/alternative-finance/downloads/2018-12-ccaf-2nd-global-cryptoasset-benchmarking.pdf</p><p>[iii] The World Bank, “Total greenhouse gas emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)”, data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.GHGT.KT.CE?view=chart, (accessed 21 July 2017).</p><p>[iv] Janssens-Maenhout, G. et al, 2017, “JRC Science for Policy Report” edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/booklet2017/CO2_and_GHG_emissions_of_all_world_countries_booklet_online.pdf (accessed 21 June 2018)</p><p>[v] Kilvert, N., 2017, “Paris agreement slipping away as record global CO2 emissions predicted for 2017”, archive.li/zpYnW</p><p>[vi] International Energy Agency, 2017, “Key World Energy Statistics”, archive.is/PFlG3</p>♦

  <p>Some questions have easy answers. “What have you learned from Bitcoin?”
isn’t one of them. After trying to answer this question in a short
tweet, and failing miserably, I realized that the amount of things I’ve
learned is far too numerous to answer quickly, if at all. I also
realized that any set of answers to this question will be different for
everyone — a reflection of the very personal journey through the
wonderful world of crypto. Hence, the subtitle of this series is What
I’ve Learned From Bitcoin, with which I want to acknowledge the
inherent personal bias of answering a question like this.</p>

<p>I tried to group the teachings of Bitcoin by topics, resulting in three
parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Philosophical Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
  <li>Economic Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
  <li>Technological Teachings of Bitcoin</li>
</ol>

<p>As hinted above, attempting to answer this question fully is a fool’s
errand, thus my answers will always be incomplete. I would like to
lessen this shortcoming by inviting you, dear reader, to share your own
answers to this question:</p>



  ♦




<p>Bitcoin is indeed a game disguised. It is akin to a trapdoor, a gateway
to a different world. A world much stranger than I would have ever
imagined it to be. A world which takes your assumptions and shatters
them into a thousand tiny pieces, again and again. Stick around for long
enough, and Bitcoin will completely change your worldview.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill — the
story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to
believe. You take the red pill — you stay in Wonderland, and I show
you how deep the rabbit hole goes.”
<cite>Morpheus</cite></p>
</blockquote>



  ♦






Lesson 1: Immutability and change

<p>Bitcoin is inherently hard to describe. It is a new thing, and any
attempt to draw a comparison to previous concepts — be it by calling
it digital gold or the internet of money — is bound to fall short of
the whole. Whatever your favorite analogy might be, two aspects of
Bitcoin are absolutely essential: decentralization and immutability.</p>

<p>One way to think about Bitcoin is as an automated social contract. The
software is just one piece of the puzzle, and hoping to change Bitcoin
by changing the software is an exercise in futility. One would have to
convince the rest of the network to adopt the changes, which is more a
psychological effort than a software engineering one.</p>

<p>The following might sound absurd at first, like so many other things in
this space, but I believe that it is profoundly true nonetheless: You
won’t change Bitcoin, but Bitcoin will change you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bitcoin will change us more than we will change it.”
<cite>Marty Bent</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It took me a long time to realize the profundity of this. Since Bitcoin
is just software and all of it is open-source, you can simply change
things at will, right? Wrong. Very wrong. Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin’s
creator knew this all too well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the
core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people have attempted to change Bitcoin’s nature. So far all of
them have failed. While there is an endless sea of forks and altcoins,
the Bitcoin network still does its thing, just as it did when the first
node went online. The altcoins won’t matter in the long run. The forks
will eventually starve to death. Bitcoin is what matters. As long as our
fundamental understanding of mathematics and/or physics doesn’t change,
the Bitcoin honeybadger will continue to not care.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bitcoin is the first example of a new form of life. It lives and
breathes on the internet. It lives because it can pay people to keep
it alive. […] It can’t be changed. It can’t be argued with. It
can’t be tampered with. It can’t be corrupted. It can’t be stopped.
[…] If nuclear war destroyed half of our planet, it would continue
to live, uncorrupted. “
<cite>Ralph Merkle</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The heartbeat of the Bitcoin network will outlast all of ours.</p>

<p>Realizing the above changed me way more than the past blocks of the
Bitcoin blockchain ever will. It changed my time preference, my
understanding of economics, my political views, and so much more. Hell,
it is even changing people’s diets. If all of this sounds crazy to
you, you’re in good company. All of this is crazy, and yet it is
happening.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that it won’t change. I will.</p>

Lesson 2: The scarcity of scarcity

<p>In general, the advance of technology seems to make things more
abundant. More and more people are able to enjoy what previously have
been luxurious goods. Soon, we will all live like kings. Most of us
already do. As Peter Diamandis wrote in Abundance: “Technology is a
resource-liberating mechanism. It can make the once scarce the now
abundant.”</p>

<p>Bitcoin, an advanced technology in itself, breaks this trend and creates
a new commodity which is truly scarce. Some even argue that it is one of
the scarcest things in the universe. The supply can’t be inflated, no
matter how much effort one chooses to expend towards creating more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Only two things are genuinely scarce: time and bitcoin.”
<cite>Saifedean Ammous</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Paradoxically, it does so by a mechanism of copying. Transactions are
broadcast, blocks are propagated, the distributed ledger is — well,
you guessed it — distributed. All of these are just fancy words for
copying. Heck, Bitcoin even copies itself onto as many computers as it
can, by incentivizing individual people to run full nodes and mine new
blocks.</p>

<p>All of this duplication wonderfully works together in a concerted effort
to produce scarcity.</p>

<p>In a time of abundance, Bitcoin taught me what real scarcity is.</p>

Lesson 3: An immaculate conception

<p>Everyone loves a good origin story. The origin story of Bitcoin is a
fascinating one, and the details of it are more important than one might
think at first. Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? Was he one person or a group of
people? Was he a she? Time-traveling alien, or advanced AI? Outlandish
theories aside, we will probably never know. And this is important.</p>

<p>Satoshi chose to be anonymous. He planted the seed of Bitcoin. He stuck
around for long enough to make sure the network won’t die in its
infancy. And then he vanished.</p>

<p>What might look like a weird anonymity stunt is actually crucial for a
truly decentralized system. No centralized control. No centralized
authority. No inventor. No-one to prosecute, torture, blackmail, or
extort. An immaculate conception of technology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the greatest things that Satoshi did was disappear.”
<cite>Jimmy Song</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the birth of Bitcoin, thousands of other cryptocurrencies were
created. None of these clones share its origin story. If you want to
supersede Bitcoin, you will have to transcend its origin story. In a war
of ideas, narratives dictate survival.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Gold was first fashioned into jewelry and used for barter over 7,000
years ago. Gold’s captivating gleam led to it being considered a gift
from the gods.”
<cite>Gold: The Extraordinary Metal</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like gold in ancient times, Bitcoin might be considered a gift from the
gods. Unlike gold, Bitcoins origins are all too human. And this time, we
know who the gods of development and maintenance are: people all over
the world, anonymous or not.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that narratives are important.</p>

Lesson 4: The problem of identity

<p>Nic Carter, in an homage to Thomas Nagel’s treatment of the same
question in regards to a bat, wrote an excellent piece which discusses
the following question: What is it like to be a bitcoin? He
brilliantly shows that open, public blockchains in general, and Bitcoin
in particular, suffer from the same conundrum as the Ship of
Theseus: which Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Consider just how little persistence Bitcoin’s components have. The
entire codebase has been reworked, altered, and expanded such that it
barely resembles its original version. […] The registry of who
owns what, the ledger itself, is virtually the only persistent trait
of the network […]</p>

  <p>To be considered truly leaderless, you must surrender the easy
solution of having an entity that can designate one chain as the
legitimate one.”
<cite>Nic Carter</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems like the advancement of technology keeps forcing us to take
these philosophical questions seriously. Sooner or later, self-driving
cars will be faced with real-world versions of the trolley problem,
forcing them to make ethical decisions about whose lives do matter and
whose do not.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies, especially since the first contentious hard-fork,
force us to think about and agree upon the metaphysics of identity.
Interestingly, the two biggest examples we have so far have lead to two
different answers. On August 1, 2017, Bitcoin split into two camps. The
market decided that the unaltered chain is the original Bitcoin. One
year earlier, on October 25, 2016, Ethereum split into two camps. The
market decided that the altered chain is the original Ethereum.</p>

<p>If properly decentralized, the questions posed by the Ship of Theseus
will have to be answered in perpetuity for as long as these networks of
value-transfer exist.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that decentralization contradicts identity.</p>

Lesson 5: Replication and locality

<p>Quantum mechanics aside, locality is a non-issue in the physical world.
The question “Where is X?” can be answered in a meaningful way, no
matter if X is a person or an object. In the digital world, the question
of where is already a tricky one, but not impossible to answer. Where
are your emails, really? A bad answer would be “the cloud”, which is
just someone else’s computer. Still, if you wanted to track down every
storage device which has your emails on it you could, in theory, locate
them.</p>

<p>With bitcoin, the question of “where” is really tricky. Where,
exactly, are your bitcoins?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I opened my eyes, looked around, and asked the inevitable, the
traditional, the lamentably hackneyed postoperative question: ‘Where
am l?’”
<cite>Daniel Dennett</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem is twofold: First, the distributed ledger is distributed by
full replication, meaning the ledger is everywhere. Second, there are no
bitcoins. Not only physically, but technically.</p>

<p>Bitcoin keeps track of a set of unspent transaction outputs, without
ever having to refer to an entity which represents a bitcoin. The
existence of a bitcoin is inferred by looking at the set of unspent
transaction outputs and calling every entry with a 100 million base
units a bitcoin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Where is it, at this moment, in transit? […] First, there are no
bitcoins. There just aren’t. They don’t exist. There are ledger
entries in a ledger that’s shared […] They don’t exist in any
physical location. The ledger exists in every physical location,
essentially. Geography doesn’t make sense here — it is not going to
help you figuring out your policy here.”
<cite>Peter Van Valkenburgh</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, what do you actually own when you say “I have a bitcoin” if there
are no bitcoins? Well, remember all these strange words which you were
forced to write down by the wallet you used? Turns out these magic words
are what you own: a magic spell which can be used to add some entries
to the public ledger — the keys to “move” some bitcoins. This is why,
for all intents and purposes, your private keys are your bitcoins. If
you think I’m making all of this up feel free to send me your private
keys.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that locality is a tricky business.</p>

Lesson 6: The power of free speech

<p>Bitcoin is an idea. An idea which, in its current form, is the
manifestation of a machinery purely powered by text. Every aspect of
Bitcoin is text: The whitepaper is text. The software which is run by
its nodes is text. The ledger is text. Transactions are text. Public and
private keys are text. Every aspect of Bitcoin is text, and thus
equivalent to speech.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”
<cite>First Amendment to the United States Constitution</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although the final battle of the Crypto Wars has not been fought yet,
it will be very difficult to criminalize an idea, let alone an idea
which is based on the exchange of text messages. Every time a government
tries to outlaw text or speech, we slip down a path of absurdity which
inevitably leads to abominations like illegal numbers and illegal
primes.</p>

<p>As long as there is a part of the world where speech is free as in
freedom, Bitcoin is unstoppable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no point in any Bitcoin transaction that Bitcoin ceases to
be text. It is all text, all the time. […]</p>

  <p>Bitcoin is text. Bitcoin is speech. It cannot be regulated in
a free country like the USA with guaranteed inalienable rights and a
First Amendment that explicitly excludes the act of publishing from
government oversight.”
<cite>Beautyon</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that in a free society, free speech and free software
are unstoppable.</p>

Lesson 7: The limits of knowledge

<p>Getting into Bitcoin is a humbling experience. I thought that I knew
things. I thought that I was educated. I thought that I knew my computer
science, at the very least. I studied it for years, so I have to know
everything about digital signatures, hashes, encryption, operational
security, and networks, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>Learning all the fundamentals which make Bitcoin work is hard.
Understanding all of them deeply is borderline impossible.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“No one has found the bottom of the Bitcoin rabbit hole.”
<cite>Jameson Lopp</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>My list of books to read keeps expanding way quicker than I could
possibly read them. The list of papers and articles to read is virtually
endless. There are more podcasts on all of these topics than I could
ever listen to. It truly is humbling. Further, Bitcoin is evolving and
it’s almost impossible to stay up-to-date with the accelerating rate of
innovation. The dust of the first layer hasn’t even settled yet, and
people have already built the second layer and are working on the third.</p>

<p>Bitcoin taught me that I know very little about almost anything. It
taught me that this rabbit hole is bottomless.</p>



Conclusion

<p>Bitcoin is a child of the internet. Even though it requires computers to
function efficiently, computer science is not sufficient to understand
it. The implications of this new technology are far-reaching. Bitcoin is
not only borderless but also boundaryless in respect to academic
disciplines.</p>

<p>In this first part of the Teachings of Bitcoin I tried to outline some
of the philosophical implications of this fascinating machinery. In part
two I will try to discuss what Bitcoin taught me about economics. Part
three will conclude this series to show what I, a technologist, have
learned from the tech perspective by stumbling into Bitcoin.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I think that any answer to the question “What have
you learned from Bitcoin?” will always be incomplete. The systems are
too dynamic, the space moving too fast, and the topics too numerous.
Politics, game theory, monetary history, network theory, finance,
cryptography, information theory, censorship, law and regulation, human
organization, psychology — all these and more are areas of expertise
which might help to grasp what Bitcoin is.</p>

  The Bitcoin Bell-Curve — A Long-Term Solution to Global Wealth &amp; Income Inequality<p>The bell-curve is a beautiful thing and generally reflects “the natural order of things” in Life and Nature. Most of the population gather around the mean, with fewer on either side. Individuals move closer to, or further away from the mean due to natural factors. It’s natural to see the curve skew one way or the other, but it’s rarely a very extreme skew.</p><p>Since a picture speaks a thousand words — here’s a standard normal distribution</p>♦<p>If the world’s wealth was normally distributed, there’d be a concentration of 60 to 70% of wealth around a strong middle class, with the inevitable “haves” and “have-nots” going to the extremes. Sound’s awesome!</p><p>But the world’s wealth doesn’t follow a normal distribution, but something so skewed that it’s almost impossible to capture or be meaningful. You’d have to look at it how you look at the price of Bitcoin — Log scale as Nature intended! It might be better to illustrate with a pyramid. But I’ll illustrate it with 4 layered pyramids instead, to show the recurring exponential themes.</p><p>Here’s the first one, and it looks pretty bad. Here, we can see that people with more than $1 million of wealth, about 42 million of them or 0.8% of the world’s 5-billion strong adult population, hold 44.8% of the world’s wealth. One thing to remember is that there are hundreds of millions of people who have NEGATIVE wealth as a result of debt, so the true plight of the people is also lost amongst the pyramids.</p>♦Pyramid 1 — Global Wealth Pyramid (Source: Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook 2018)<p>Spare your sympathy however, because what “&gt;$1 million in wealth” really means will shock you! Let’s look at pyramid 2.</p>♦Pyramid 2 — The “Top” of the Pyramid<p>Spare a thought for those poor “single-digit” millionaires, who are frequently lumped in with the rest of the fat cats when The Occupy Movement are expressing their valid frustrations. They look like a big majority based on the number of them, but their individual financial clout is laughable. In the majority of cases, it simply means that you have no mortgage on your family home. You may say I’m talking crazy, but you haven’t seen what “&gt;50 million” means! On to pyramid 3!</p>♦Pyramid 3 — Ultra Wealth by Tier (source: Wealth-X World Ultra Wealth Report 2017)<p>Here’s where it REALLY starts to get tasty. The above data from 2016 shows that ultra-wealthy people, the 0.0045%, hold 27 of the world’s 317 trillion dollars in wealth, or, just over 8.5% of all wealth. The reason I stress that this is 2016 data, is that it looks much worse in 2018! Onto pyramid 4, and what “$1bn+” means.</p>♦Pyramid 4 — Forbes Billionaire’s List Data (as applied to Wealth-X’s graphic template)<p>According to the Forbes Billionaire’s list, there were 2208 people on the list, with an average net worth of $4.1bn, and a total net worth of 9.1 trillion. This is how it looks in pyramid form.</p><p>In a world where Bitcoin is the monetary standard, wealth distribution will tend towards a normal distribution due to its finite nature. I would go so far as to say that Global Wealth could approach a normal distribution by the end of this century. Since Bitcoin is “the nature of money”, indeed, it is also the “life” and “energy” of money, it is only natural that it will mirror life and nature itself.</p><p>With a concentration of wealth around a strong middle class, and the necessity for the wealthy to continue to innovate and “work” to maintain their level of “monetised energy”, members of the population will necessarily move towards and away from the mean. “Work” could be anything that adds value to the market — being physical work, or capitalist pursuits. It also enables upward mobility — when the poor “work”, their energy is permanently conserved until it is again spent — no more dilution of wealth and systematised poverty.</p><p>Random acts of nature can also happen, such as losing your private keys, which can take you from 3 standard deviations to the right of the mean, to 3 standard deviations to the left! No one is safe from Nature. Which brings me to my final point…</p><p>You will not find Utopia in communism or socialism — the proposed wealth distribution curves offered by those ideologies violate natural laws, and are ultimately destined to be destroyed by Nature’s forces. “Capitalism-as-is” has also violated the laws of Nature by creating money out of nothing, and it too will be destroyed by Nature. Even a staunch Capitalist like myself would tell you that we’re living in more of an Orwellian Nightmare than a Utopia.</p><p>Utopia awaits in a Capitalist system powered by a Bitcoin Standard. It is known.</p>Acknowledgements<p>Many thanks to Victor Erem for proof-reading and editing</p>♦

  <p>Imagine you have a hammer — a magical hammer — which can smash
anything into pieces with one stroke. Not only that, this hammer can
completely pulverize everything it touches into a fine gray dust.</p>

<p>Further imagine that there was a magic potion, one drop of which will
turn the heap of dust back into the item you smashed.</p>

<p>This leads to some interesting questions.</p>

<p>Suppose you want to visit a country and you want to bring your favorite
pair of pajama pants with you. The only problem, however, is that pants
are illegal in this country. Maybe it’s a weird country, or maybe that’s
the reason why you want to go there in the first place. Either way, I
don’t judge.</p>

<p>Now, remember that you are in the possession of this magical hammer. You
use it on your pajama pants, and *poof*, you have a tiny bag of gray
dust which you can put in your pocket. The pocket of your jacket, of
course, because you will be asked to leave all your pants at the border!</p>

<p>Where exactly are the pajama pants now? In the dust? In the potion? Do
they currently exist? Does the concept of “your pajama pants” even make
sense, if all you have is indistinguishable gray dust and a tiny drop of
a magic potion? What if you would only need a drop of water, and speak
some magic words, to turn the dust back into pajama pants? What if the
dust was ubiquitous, everywhere on earth?</p>



<p>We, as a global society, are currently in the process of moving from the
physical realm of things to the digital realm of information. We are
quickly moving towards the fantastical world of no-pants land, and we
will have to update our current conceptions of things if we want to stay
sane.</p>

<p>Many things which used to be on pieces of paper are now digital: your
train ticket, your boarding pass, tickets to a concert, debit cards,
credit cards — all of these already moved from being printed on paper
to a bunch of zeros and ones, decoupled from the physical realm we are
so used to.</p>

<p>Even those pieces of paper which encode value itself are slowly but
surely moved to the purely digital realm. A rising number of people are
willing to convert their hard-earned paper money into bitcoin, leaving
the world of physical money behind completely.</p>

<p>Over time, more and more valuable pieces of paper will be eaten up by
this digitalization. Soon your driver’s license, your passport, your
birth certificate and other documents will be digital.</p>

<p>Why is this a big deal? Digital information is quite different from
physical artifacts. It can be easily scrambled, taken apart, and put
together again. It has completely novel characteristics compared to the
physical stuff we are so used to. It can be duplicated perfectly,
checked for authenticity instantly, and hidden in plain sight.
Information is independent of a physical substrate and thus can take
virtually infinite forms.</p>



  ♦


  'Jefferson would have been all about crypto.'



<p>What the full implications of this digitization will be is impossible to
tell. We are not accustomed to this world of information: devoid of
physical form, touch, and smell.</p>

<p>Remember the tale of no-pants-land? Let’s return to this weird and
wonderful world, but with a twist: your pajama pants are now your
passport.</p>

<p>Let’s say you have a properly encrypted digital passport and a
decryption key of sufficient length. You put the encrypted passport in
one place and the key in another place. Where is the passport, exactly?
A or B? Somewhere in between? Does it even exist? Does the question of
“where” make sense in the first place?</p>

<p>What if you upload your encrypted passport to the cloud or a distributed
storage system like ipfs? What if your encrypted passport was
ubiquitous, everywhere on earth? What if you memorize the key as a
mnemonic phrase? Is your passport now in your brain?</p>

<p>Does the concept of “your passport” even make sense, if all you have is
access to the internet and some magic words?</p>



<p>Warning: The following section contains example private keys. Do not import
any sample keys or send bitcoins to the associated addresses; you will lose
your money.</p>



<p>Take Bitcoin as another example: you are no longer in possession of
physical coins, or any physical artifact for that matter. No amount of
calling these things coins can change that. Even hardware wallets don’t
change that. You possess a piece of information, your private key, which
allows you to spend your funds. Effectively, your private key is your
money, which in turn is information. Thus, your money is pure
information.</p>



  ♦


  Never ever do that. Anyone who knows your private key can steal
your funds.



<p>A private key is just a bunch of random bits. It can be encoded as a
bunch of zeros and ones:</p>

<pre><code>0010111011001011101110101011010110001001101111010001011010100110001001110010101110101010101100000001101100000111000000011100010100100001000001010001011011100000111000111010101001111101000110111010100011011111000101111100000110100010110110000010101010111111
</code></pre>

<p>It could also be heads and tails, as pointed out by Andreas M.
Antonopoulos in Mastering Bitcoin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The bitcoin private key is just a number. You can pick your private
keys randomly using just a coin, pencil, and paper: toss a coin 256
times and you have the binary digits of a random private key you can
use in a bitcoin wallet.”
<cite>Andreas M. Antonopoulos</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same information can be represented as a regular number:</p>

<pre><code>21166349608056686127730669456997431530107294209230839699814678496870930066111
</code></pre>

<p>We can also use the hexadecimal system to represent this number, to keep
things a bit shorter:</p>

<pre><code>12e188aeb7c9aeb0eef7fac7c89e3b9b535a30b2ce8d6b74b706fa6f86b061e4
</code></pre>

<p>An even shorter representation would be the wallet import format:</p>

<pre><code>5HxbsUekuCLjzLQujGb6QuzkDUMxQETQRgWjcJPx21hFsfDS3Fq
</code></pre>

<p>The same information can be encoded as a mnemonic code, resulting in
these 24 words, which you could remember with a bit of practice:</p>

<pre><code>concert, frozen, pull, battle, spend, fancy, orient, inside, quiz, submit, scare, mechanic, awake, mercy, lock, inside, language, tag, dash, control, borrow, hip, print, absorb
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you’re Japanese:</p>

<pre><code>かんち 、さべつ 、なにごと 、うくれれ 、ぴんち 、このよ 、てあみ 、せたい 、におい 、へいあん 、はいすい 、たそがれ 、いらい 、だっしゅつ 、そんみん 、せたい 、そうき 、ほこう 、きよう 、きうい 、うんどう 、しょもつ 、どようび 、あけがた
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, we can also encode this information as various images.</p>

  Same as above, but as one pixel per color



<p>You can also be more creative and hide a bitcoin private key in a piece
of art:</p>

<p>You get the idea.</p>



<p>Why is this a big deal? Our current way of doing things is adapted to
the physical, not the digital world. Some laws and regulations which
made sense previously might not be very useful in the abstract space of
zeros and ones.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Central banks now have no way of stopping competition by just passing
laws as they have always done. They are now up against a digital
competitor that most likely cannot be brought under the physical
world’s laws.”
<cite>Saifedean Ammous, The Bitcoin Standard</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Governments and corporations will continually try to outlaw certain
kinds of information. It is likely that the last battle of the crypto
wars hasn’t been fought yet, and yet it seems that it will be harder
and harder for governments and companies to outlaw the use of these
algorithms. After all, these mathematical magic tricks are themselves
information, making them virtually unstoppable in the very same way as
the information they manipulate.</p>

<p>As long as we aren’t under the rule of a worldwide totalitarian
dictatorship, people will continue to exercise their freedom of speech
to print encryption algorithms on t-shirts, design flags to distribute
cryptographic keys, and sing songs containing illegal information.</p>

  Free Speech Flag by John Marcotte.



<p>Due to the nature of information discussed above, outlawing any
information leads to absurd consequences. Since information can be
encoded in a myriad of ways, banning information leads to illegal
numbers and other absurdities.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Any piece of digital information is representable as a number;
consequently, if communicating a specific set of information is
illegal in some way, then the number may be illegal as well.”
<cite>Wikipedia contributors, Illegal number
(this version)</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>You might think that the tale of no-pants land featuring your favorite
pajamas is silly, but we are already living in this world — fairy tale
or not.</p>

<p>Let’s pick a specific example: When crossing U.S. borders with a big bag
of money, you are required by law to declare how much money you have
on you if it is more than $10,000:</p>

<pre><code>"[...] if a person or persons traveling together and filing a joint declaration (CBP Form 6059-B) have $10,000 or more in currency or negotiable monetary instruments, they must fill out a "Report of International Transportation of Currency and Monetary Instruments" FinCEN 105 (former CF 4790)."
</code></pre>

<p>This is easily enforceable if you bring an actual bag of money with you.
Let’s assume you have more than $10,000 in bitcoin. Where exactly is
your money? Is it in the blockchain, i.e. everywhere? Is your money your
private key? What if your private key was on a small device? What if
you bring it with you in the form of just a couple of words on a piece
of paper? What if it was a QR code tattooed inside your lips? What if
you had a billion dollars stored in your brain? Would you have to
declare these words in your brain?</p>

<p>That’s the tricky thing about information: it isn’t a thing. It
transcends the physical realm.</p>



<p>These alien concepts are slowly but surely creeping into our daily
lives, changing the power balance of society as they get understood and
adopted by more and more people.</p>

<p>Like all tools, cryptography is neither all good nor all bad. If used
and understood properly, it can be a liberating force. It can enable
people to safely speak out and help disseminate information where it
would otherwise be censored. It can guarantee freedom of speech and
anonymity. It can also enable unstoppable crime, lead to accidental loss
of data, and enable new forms of blackmail and extortion. If abused by
tyrants, it can be a force of oppression. Despite all this, we should
neither fear nor dismiss these technologies. We should strive to
understand them.</p>

<p>We are already living in a world where both a totalitarian
techno-panopticon and an anarcho-capitalist system dreamed up by
cypherpunks is a reality.</p>

<p>Computers turned the abstract world of mathematics into tangible
machines which interact with the world. The Internet connected these
machines creating a global, borderless network. Cryptography and
decentralization are making information exchange on this network
unstoppable. What will happen if more and more things will become pure
information? What are the consequences of unbreakable and
censorship-resistant codes?</p>

<p>We are entering a new era. An era where information can be put in
digital safes which can’t be opened by force. An era where you can
transfer value globally and near-instantly without anyone’s permission.
An era where physical artifacts can be downloaded and printed for
near-zero marginal cost. An era where world-changing inventions can be

  <p>You might have heard that Bitcoin wastes a tremendous amount of energy. You
might also have heard that Bitcoin will use half a percent of the
world’s electric energy by the end of the year, the computations used
for mining don’t do anything useful, and if the current rate of growth
continues it will suck up all the energy and we are all going to die.</p>

<p>I don’t want to dispute the numbers or compare Bitcoin’s energy
usage to the current banking system. I simply want to offer a shift in
perspective.</p>

Bitcoin is Offensive

<p>Bitcoin is a global, permission-less, censorship-resistant network. Its
nature is inherently offensive. It offends governments, bankers, and
central authorities alike. Hell, offending banks was the whole point of
this experiment in the first place.</p>

<p>At first glance, Bitcoin is the worst database ever devised by mankind.
In addition to being seemingly inefficient and slow, it is eating up
computational resources at a mad pace and consumes as much energy as a
small country.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In comparison to modern distributed databases, blockchains are slow,
ponderous, unnecessarily redundant and overly paranoid.”
<cite>Dhruv Bansal</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Nick Szabo so succinctly put it: “Bitcoin offends the sensibilities
of resource-conscious and performance-measure-maximizing engineers and
businessmen alike.” It also offends our globally shared understanding
that wasting energy is bad, and energy-efficiency is always good.</p>

<p>According to a recent paper “the Bitcoin network can be estimated to
consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and
potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with
countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts).”</p>

<p>It’s easy to be concerned, outraged or offended. “Did you know Bitcoin
uses as much energy as Austria? Baby cows are dying because of
Bitcoin!”</p>



  ♦


  What-what the hell is a gigawatt?



<p>To understand why all these gigawatts are necessary for the Bitcoin
network to function properly and securely, we will have to take a closer
look at the nuances of mining.</p>

Mining Blocks and Coins

<p>The name “mining” stems from the proposition that bitcoin has more in
common with gold and other precious metals than paper money. Satoshi
made this clear in one of his posts.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this sense, it’s more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the
supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is
predetermined and the value changes.”
<cite>Satoshi Nakamoto</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hence bitcoins are not printed, they are mined. Even though we talk
about “mining bitcoins” all the time, keep in mind that it isn’t
bitcoins which are mined. Blocks are mined, and miners are currently
rewarded with new bitcoins if they find a valid block. Miners are
rewarded because finding new blocks is inherently difficult. The system
is set up in a way that the difficulty of finding a new block is
adjusted automatically so that a new block is found every 10 minutes on
average. Differentiating between “mining bitcoins” and “mining blocks”
helps to point out a couple of things:</p>

<p>First, that the rate at which bitcoins are mined is decoupled from
Bitcoin’s energy use. If everyone would decide to double the energy
spent on mining, the number of bitcoins mined would not double as a
consequence. The rate of supply is fixed, no matter how much energy you
choose to expend for mining.</p>

<p>Second, that miners do a lot more than bringing new bitcoins into
existence: maintaining the security and continuity of the network,
confirming transactions, and signaling their support or rejection of
network changes, to name a few. Not all of these require an excessive
amount of energy, which is one of the reasons why running a full node
is important.</p>

<p>Third, that mining is not a fixed process. Both the mining reward and
the mining difficulty are dynamic and thus will necessarily change over
time.</p>

<p>Fourth, that mining is supposed to cost a lot of energy. It is computationally
expensive by design, which is why Satoshi chose to reward people extra for
expending this energy. It is the main ingredient of the Nakamoto Consensus. It
is the work in proof-of-work. It is absolutely essential.</p>



<p>Without a closer look at the mining process, it is easy to confuse the
energy-intensive process of finding valid blocks with “finding new
bitcoins”. From this perspective, it seems like all this electrical
energy is transmuted into new bitcoins.</p>

<p>This is wrong.</p>

<p>The energy expended acts as a barrier which protects the public ledger.
The creation of new bitcoins is just a side-effect.</p>

Cryptographic Walls

<p>Until very recently, securing something meant building a thick wall
around whatever is deemed valuable. We all know how to do this, and we
all agree that this is a sensible thing to do.</p>

<p>The new world of cryptocurrencies is unintuitive and weird. There are no
physical walls to protect our money, no doors to access our vaults.
Bitcoin’s public ledger is secured by its collective hashing power: the
sum of all energy expended to do the work in its proof-of-work chain.</p>

<p>Thus, we can think of Bitcoin’s energy usage like a giant wall — a
sort of electrical force-field — which secures all bitcoin balances of
all users, now, and in the future.</p>

<p>It is hard to say how much energy has to be expended building these
cryptographic walls. Financial systems are critical infrastructure,
which is why most engineers in this space rightfully argue that security
and stability are paramount. If Bitcoin will be the money of the future,
it better be prepared to withstand high-impact, low-probability events.</p>

<p>How thick will these cryptographic walls need to be? Only time will
tell. If Bitcoin is able to survive coordinated attacks by multiple
state-level attackers, the walls were thick enough.</p>

The End of Mining New Bitcoins

<p>Bootstrapping a new network is difficult. It’s like trying to convince
everyone to buy a fax machine if you are the only guy in the world with
a fax machine. It’s really, really hard. As outlined above, Satoshi
solved this problem by adding a block reward mechanism, which acts as
(a) the controlled currency supply of Bitcoin and (b) an incentive for
people to participate in the network to expand and secure the public
ledger.</p>

<p>Expending energy is essential to provide security for this new financial
network.</p>

<p>The current phase of “mining bitcoins”, where miners are incentivized
with a high reward, is a clever way to get the network started. In other
words: everyone who is greedily mining bitcoins today is helping to
bootstrap this new financial system, whether they realize it or not.</p>



  ♦


  John Nash commenting on the game theoretical aspect of Satoshi's invention.



<p>As mentioned above, Bitcoin’s mining difficulty adjusts automatically,
leading to a dynamic, self-correcting system. If mining — for whatever
reason — gets more expensive, fewer people will mine at a profit,
resulting in fewer people mining, lowering the mining difficulty. This,
in turn, will make mining easier again and thus cheaper, which will
incentivize more people to mine.</p>



<p>Over time, the financial incentive of running a mining operation will
change. It follows that Bitcoin’s energy consumption will change as
well. The reason why change is inevitable is Bitcoin’s block reward
function which ensures a controlled, limited supply.</p>

<p>The block reward is halving every 210.000 blocks and will eventually
reach zero, after 64 halvings. After the last of these halvings,
miners will be left with transaction fees as the only financial reward
for mining a new block.</p>

<p>In other words: The “mining of new bitcoins” will eventually stop. The
mining of valid blocks will continue after that.</p>



  ♦


  In Bitcoin, code truly is law.



<p>One could argue that we are currently in the bitcoin equivalent of the
Gold Rush, where the reward for mining as well as the future projected
reward far outstrips the investment and energy costs. While it is hard
to estimate how much security is enough security, a case could be made
that the Bitcoin network is currently “hypersecured” as a side-effect of
this Gold Rush.</p>



  ♦


  Bitcoin's controlled supply and block reward over time.



<p>We are still in the early phases of Bitcoin’s block reward phase, as the
above graph shows.</p>

<p>Whether the adaption of bitcoin as a currency will be slow and steady,
or exponential and parabolic, a continued exponential growth of energy
consumption is very questionable. I would argue that excessive growth
will give way to a somewhat sensible balance between security and energy
consumption as the block reward approaches zero. Depending on the future
value of bitcoin and the willingness of people to pay transaction fees,
this balance might be leaning more towards security or more towards
conservative use of energy.</p>

Modern Blocks of Marble

<p>Once you wrap your head around proof-of-work, it becomes more and more
clear that the energy consumption of the Bitcoin network is not a bug,
it’s a feature. As far as we know, you can’t cheat the laws of
thermodynamics. Given that we don’t have any world-shattering
breakthroughs in physics, mathematics and/or quantum computing,
expending energy is the only way to flip bits, and flipping bits is the
only way to mine new blocks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don’t have an intuitive understanding of this new
cryptographic world (yet). Fully grasping the importance of
proof-of-work requires a deep-dive into a multitude of topics. We lack
concise, easy, elegant explanations and metaphors. Hugo Nguyen did a
great job explaining how proof-of-work links the abstract, digital world
of bitcoin to our physical world:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“By attaching energy to a block, we give it “form”, allowing it to
have real weight &amp; consequences in the physical world.”
<cite>Hugo Nguyen</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Proof-of-work is essentially a mechanism to easily check the
truthfulness of the statement “I worked really hard to create this
thing”. From that perspective, our new and fancy computational blocks
are a bit like blocks of marble, and proof-of-work is a bit like looking
at a beautiful marble statue. It is immediately obvious that a lot of
work went into creating the statue. Cheating is extremely hard, because
creating such a glorious statue without actually doing the work is
pretty much impossible. You can’t throw a block of marble against a wall
and everything which is not David will fall off. It’s not impossible,
but it is very, very, very unlikely. Instead, you have to chisel away
at the marble, and you have to do it properly and with care. One might
argue that this is one of the reasons why great artworks are so
valuable: a lot of thought, care and work was expended to create them.</p>



  ♦

<p>It is similarly unlikely to find valid blocks without actually doing the
work. Like an ugly half-haphazardly chiseled statue, an invalid block
can be simply thrown away. When you see a valid block, however, you
immediately know a lot of work went into it.</p>

<p>In both cases, the artifacts themselves, the statue and the valid block,
are in itself the proof of work.</p>

<p>My point is that understanding the nature of proof-of-work and the
incentives of mining valid blocks, as well as the security properties
and thus the value of proof-of-work, might help to shift the perspective
from “energy wasted” to “energy used for creating something valuable”.
Most people value beautiful marble statues. A rising number of people
value a chain of valid blocks.</p>

Security Through Purity

<p>Another feature disguised as a bug is the randomness of bitcoin’s
proof-of-work. A common suggestion for improvement is that we could use
all this electricity to do something else, something truly useful,
like finding prime numbers or compute protein foldings, in addition to
securing the network.</p>

<p>Again, this objection to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work algorithm is rooted in
the assumption that finding valid blocks is inherently useless. It is
not.</p>

<p>While introducing a secondary reward for doing the work might seem like
a good idea, it actually introduces a security risk.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem with doing something else — something that other people
might consider useful — is that that splits the reward. It means
that miners have two reasons for which they are mining.
<cite>Andreas M. Antonopoulos</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Splitting the reward can lead to a situation where “it’s more worthwhile
to do the secondary function that it is to do the primary function”.
Bitcoin will never have this problem. Bitcoin guarantees its security by
the purity of its proof-of-work algorithm.</p>

<p>If someone figures out a more energy-efficient way to secure an open,
decentralized, censorship-resistant, permission- and trustless network
for value exchange — without compromising one of these
qualities — this hypothetical future network will eventually dethrone
Bitcoin, solving this supposed energy problem. And no, proof-of-stake
is probably not the answer.</p>

<p>In the future, we might find something which is even more suited to be
an anchor for truth than energy. Until we do, we should stick to
something we are extremely confident in: the laws of thermodynamics; the
energy required to do the work in proof-of-work.</p>

Conclusion

<p>I hope to have planted the seed for a shift in perspective: that
spending energy on proof-of-work is not a waste, but a worthwhile
endeavor.</p>

<p>Understanding mining and proof-of-work in more detail might help to
convince some of Bitcoin’s critics and shift the perspective from
“inefficient and wasteful” to “secure and censorship-resistant”.
Pointing out these nuances might also be helpful to understand that
Bitcoin’s energy consumption most strongly correlates with the network’s
security, and not with the adoption, usage, or utility of bitcoin. Even
if the utility of the network and the price of bitcoin continues to
increase exponentially, the energy consumption does not necessarily need
to follow the same exponential trend. Gaining a better understanding of
the Bitcoin network might also help to understand where other solutions
fall short.</p>

<p>Satoshi’s genius was to combine a bunch of clever tricks into a new
economic game which creates a digital, scarce artifact, without central
issuance. This artifact is backed by computation, and computation
requires energy.</p>

<p>The current economic game is a game of walls and vaults, closed systems
and centralized power. The new economic game is a game of hashes and
blocks, public keys and private keys, based on mathematical proofs and
physical reality. A game without gatekeepers, without central
authorities, without censorship or discrimination.</p>

<p>The old rules have led to a system where money is valuable “because I
say so”, leading to magic tricks like fractional reserve banking,
inflation to stimulate excessive consumption, and even hyperinflation
because the temptation to print ever more money is simply irresistible.</p>

<p>The new rules might not be easy to understand. They might, however, lead
to a new financial reality: a new economy based on sound money. We will
all have to adapt to these rules and become familiar with the nuances of
this new game. And we will have to come to terms with the fact that a
finite resource has to be used to secure this new, decentralized
economy. In the case of Bitcoin, this resource is energy.</p>
