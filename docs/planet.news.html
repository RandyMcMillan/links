  Bitcoin is a Catalyst for Human Evolution (Symbiosis) — Part 4/4<p>Exploring Bitcoin through the lens of natural selection, evolution, and symbiosis</p>♦<p>This is a story of how symbiotic relationships can change the course of history forever.</p><p>Just as fungi and plants formed a symbiotic relationship to successfully colonize dry land, humans can form symbiosis with Bitcoin to improve individually and to advance our species.</p><p>In this article we’re going to explore Bitcoin as a catalyst for human evolution, through the lens of geological timescales, evolution, and symbiosis.</p><blockquote>Definition of Symbiosis: when two dissimilar organisms live together in intimate association (as in parasitism or mutualism). Example: Clownfish and Sea Anemones</blockquote><p>This is part 4 of “The Mycelium of Money,” here’s the whole series for reference.</p><ul><li>Part 1: Bitcoin is a Decentralized Organism (Mycelium)</li><li>Part 2: Bitcoin is a Social Creature (Mushroom)</li><li>Part 3: Bitcoin is the Antivirus to Uncertainty (Medicine)</li><li>Part 4: Bitcoin is a Catalyst for Human Evolution (Symbiosis) → this one</li></ul><p>Let’s begin.</p>Bootstrapping Life on Terra Incognita<p>Five hundred million years ago, all biological life lived in the oceans. Dry land as we know it was a sterile volcanic wasteland devoid of life. That is, until plants and fungi formed a fateful partnership that changed the course of history forever.</p><p>This symbiotic partnership created a cascade of evolutionary forces leading to the creation of all terrestrial life, including homo sapiens.</p><p>Fast forward to modernity, humans now organize around network based technologies, such as the internet and Bitcoin, which are reincarnations of the ancient mycelial archetype out of which we emerged.</p><p>Take a deep breath. Life is amazing.</p><p>Ok, so how did we get here?</p><p>First, a quick biology lesson. Organisms are classified as either Autotrophic or Heterotrophic.</p><p>Autotrophs are organisms that make their food. For example: plants convert sunlight and carbon dioxide into food via photosynthesis.</p><p>Heterotrophs are organisms that find their food. For example: lions eat the gazelles and fungi produce enzymes to externally digest their environment.</p><p>Like human settlers, organisms colonizing new territory are most vulnerable in the early days. In order for fungi to colonize dry land (terra), they needed to secure a reliable food source.</p><p>Fungi effectively domesticated photosynthesis machines (algae) to harness a self sustaining food source. We can think of these algae as little solar panels bolted onto fungal networks which made colonizing virgin dry land possible.</p><p>Soon after getting established, the fungi began digesting the volcanic rock upon which they sat. This ultimately liberated valuable nutrients which were then traded with other nearby fungi, algae, bacteria, etc. Together, these early settlers bootstrapped life on dry land. Let’s see how this compares to Bitcoin.</p>How Satoshi bootstrapped embryonic Bitcoin<p>In order to colonize the internet (terra incognita) with a new form of money, Satoshi needed to form a symbiotic partnership.</p><p>Fortunately, he found the perfect partnership and made a series of wise decisions that maximized Bitcoin’s chance of survival during the bootstrapping phase.</p><p>How satoshi “partnered with the algae” to bootstrap Bitcoin’s life on the internet</p><ul><li>High early issuance rate disproportionately rewarded early adopters (the early issuance rate might have been too aggressive)</li><li>Launched on the Cypherpunks mailing list (if anyone could incubate Bitcoin it was the Cypherpunks)</li><li>Timing the launch during the 08/09 financial crisis (was this blind luck?)</li><li>Satoshi’s message in the genesis block “Chancellor on the second brink of bailout” (rallying cry to gain ideologically motivated supporters)</li></ul>Mutualism or Parasitism: Examining the Cypherpunk-Satoshi-Symbiosis<p>Were the algae complicit in the fungal partnership (mutualism)? Or were the fungi taking advantage of the algae’s ability to make food at the expense of the algae (parasitism)?</p><p>It appears to be mutualism. The algae may have been initially kidnapped, however in exchange for photosynthesizing, they gained a mycelial security system, and the opportunity to colonize a new niche.</p><p>Were the cypherpunks complicit and did they benefit in the partnership (mutualism)? Or did satoshi take advantage of the cyberpunks because he needed an initial distribution strategy (parasitism)?</p><blockquote>“It’s very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I’m better with code than with words though.” — Satoshi Nakamoto</blockquote><p>Most cypherpunks dismissed Bitcoin initially, however a select few (most notably: Hal Finney) jumped onboard. Considering they were first to learn about Bitcoin, they had a chance to acquire Bitcoin’s native monetary units in exchange for the marginal electricity cost to mine (essentially nothing). With the advantage of hindsight, acquiring Bitcoin during the first few years would lead to wealth beyond measure.</p><blockquote>“The possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute time may be a good bet, a payoff of something like 100 million to 1!” — Hal Finney</blockquote>(Economic) Evolution by Natural Selection♦<p>With the initial conditions of life on land set into motion, the fungal-plant alliance can start welcoming new market participants (organisms) to enter the ecosystem.</p><p>Fungi interact with the world through chemistry. They secrete enzymes to externally digest their environment. Volcanic rock was the only restaurant in town. These early fungi liberated molecular resources by metabolizing the volcanic rock upon which they stood.</p><p>This enabled a proto-economy made up of primitive fungi, plants, and bacteria. They traded essential molecules required for carbon based lifeforms (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, etc).</p><p>Fungi were essentially turning rocks into fungible biology tokens. These biology tokens were then traded on top of mycelial rails connecting all nearby life. Fungi both created the market and facilitated trade leading to an explosion of biodiversity on dry land.</p>Terra takes her first breath<p>Before plants colonized dry land, our earth’s atmosphere wasn’t very hospitable. As you know, plants inhale CO2 and exhale O2. This ultimately led to the formation of our oxygen rich atmosphere — planet earth was taking her first breath.</p><p>In a sense, fungi unleashed free market dynamics in a new market which led to an incredible proliferation of life. Now let’s explore the parallels with Bitcoin.</p>Bitcoin enables a new economic paradigm<p>Just as novel organisms emerge (via speciation) to occupy newly created niches on dry land, Bitcoin evolves it’s DNA (code) to produce new phenotypes (novel features) to take advantage of new niches.</p><p>In other words, Bitcoin enables novel financial use cases that were not possible before. This increases the size of the economic pie, thus generating wealth for society.</p><p>Novelty provided by Bitcoin:</p><ul><li>The first and only implementation of absolute scarcity (hard to overstate)</li><li>A global, near instant, apolitical, settlement system</li><li>Neutral money not easily captured by special interests.</li><li>Uncensorable medium of exchange for black/grey markets</li><li>Democratization of basic financial services</li><li>Non-sovereign store of value with negligible barrier to entry</li></ul>Bitcoin and mycelium improve trade<p>Mycelial networks act as a resource transport layer and communications network connecting organisms in the biosphere. This enables organisms to voluntarily trade resources and knowledge across species lines. Increasing trade leads to increased specialization (division of labor), further increasing biodiversity (wealth and resilience) in the ecosystem.</p><p>Currently, our governments form economic monopolies which prevent many citizens from accessing the global markets.</p><p>Think about all the unproductive human capital siloed in countries like Iran, Venezuela, and Argentina. Without access to a common economic language (Bitcoin) many people are unable to participate in global trade.</p><p>As Bitcoin becomes ubiquitous, it unleashes human productivity leading to increased innovation, specialization, and trade. We’re already seeing some basic examples such as freelancers in Venezuela using Bitcoin as a bridge currency to access USD which effectively evades financial controls.</p><p>We can extrapolate “Bitcoin being used as a bridge currency” into a grander vision of the future where everyone speaks the same economic language. A global market for talent leads to more goods and services produced for a cheaper price. Not to mention, increased trade with developing countries will help lift people out of poverty.</p>Bitcoin enables economic evolution by natural selection<p>Darwinian evolution by natural selection is a biological engine designed to reward successful actors and eliminate unsuccessful actors. When the antelope gets eaten by the lion, it dies, no one bails out the antelope. Nature has skin in the game. This feedback loop is crucial. Individuals are fragile in order to ensure the system is antifragile.</p><p>Market based economics is an engine designed to seek more efficient uses of capital by rewarding successful ventures and punishing the unsuccessful. However, our current form of “capitalism” is more like cronyism or as Travis Kling said: “socialism for the rich.”</p><p>Instead of letting companies fail, we bail them out. This results in broken incentives which create a moral hazard making the entire system more fragile. Not to mention, disproportionately hurting the working class. Heads I win, tails you lose.</p><p>A sound money system (like Bitcoin) improves this economic engine by tightening the feedback mechanism that rewards value creation and punishes failure. In a Bitcoin world, bailouts aren’t really possible because monetary expansion is restrained by a fixed monetary base. Bitcoin ensures individual people/companies are fragile in order to ensure the economic system remains antifragile.</p><p>In other words, Bitcoin increases economic “skin in the game” which improves the feedback loop leading to economic evolution by natural selection. Economic Darwinism for the win.</p>Taming of the Tenrec♦Tenrec: the ancestor to all living placental mammals<p>Due to a symbiotic relationship with fungi and plants, and evolution by natural selection, our pale blue dot was transformed from a barren rock to the garden of eden. Truly marvelous.</p><p>Let’s zoom in to the tail-end of the Cretaceous period (~65 million years ago). The planet was dominated by dinosaurs both on land and in our oceans. Mammals were hardly relevant. Narrator: but things were about to change.</p><p>A giant meteor crashed into present day Mexico ending the dinosaurs and most life on planet earth. The impact caused a short term spike in surface temperatures followed by an extended cooling due to debris blocking out sunlight.</p><p>Although most organisms were culled during the cataclysm, some species thrived during the chaos. Most notable for our story are Fungi (of course) and a small shrew-like mammal known as the Tenrec (surprising).</p><p>Without sunlight, most plants quickly perished. However, the Fungi thrived because they don’t rely on sunlight (remember they find their own food). Fungi were happily decomposing all the newly deceased organisms.</p>What about the Tenrec?<p>As temperatures declined and food became scarce, most animals who survived the initial shock were killed by fungal pathogens or eventually starved to death as the global food chain seized up. However, not the Tenrec.</p><p>Tenrecs are humble shrew like mammals that lived underground which protected them from hostile conditions on the surface. Their favorite foods (insects and aquatic plants) were relatively unaffected.</p><p>Tenrecs are capable of hibernating for up to 9 months at a time. This protects them from short term volatility and enables them to outlast their competition. The best offense is a good defense.</p><p>Bitcoin reminds me of the tenrec, both live underground and thrive on volatility. Like the tenrec, Bitcoin simply needs to outlast it’s competition.</p><blockquote>“If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.” — Sun Tzu</blockquote><p>Give thanks to the tenrec</p><p>Turns out, the tenrec is the common ancestor to all living placental mammals. In other words, the only reason both you and I are alive today is because the tiny tenrec survived the dinosaur-ending apocalypse 65 million years ago.</p>Standing on the Shoulders of Mycelium<p>Although mammals got off to a slow start, we’ve really come into our own over the last million years. One particular great ape, the homo sapien, achieved global dominance in a relatively short timespan.</p><p>Current evidence suggests Humans have only been around for about ~500k years, making us a relatively young species. For comparison, modern elephants have been around for ~5m years.</p><p>Like our fungal forefathers, humans have formed symbiotic relationships with our environment throughout history. In fact, we owe our lives to the networked based organisms we call fungi.</p>Humans begin to settle down<p>One especially relevant fungal organism is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, otherwise known as brewers yeast.</p><p>Human agriculture appears to have begun around 11,500 years ago (although it might be much older). Interestingly, the first crops we cultivated were also the best grains for brewing beer. This begs the question: did we settle down for food/stability or to brew more beer?</p><p>Turns out fermented drinks (beer, wine, etc) provided a safe way to stay hydrated as water often contained pathogens that killed ancient man.</p><p>Although we didn’t know it at the time, humans formed symbiotic relationships with fungi in order to produce healthy drinking options that saved many lives.</p><p>Unbeknownst to most moderns, we still heavily rely on our fungal allies today. Without fungi, say goodbye to all beer, wine, chocolate, bread, and many medicines such as penicillin.</p><p>Like ancient man partnered with fungi to survive, us moderns have a similar opportunity to partner with Bitcoin…</p>Achieving Symbiosis with Bitcoin<p>We’ve established how both fungi and Bitcoin symbiotically partner with other organisms to bootstrap life and build antifragile ecosystems. Now let’s finish up by exploring how humans can partner with Bitcoin to improve individually and to advance our species.</p><blockquote>“The real problem of humanity is the following: we have Paleolithic emotions; medieval institutions; and god-like technology.” — E.O. Wilson</blockquote><p>Money is the most important coordination mechanism for society and our existing fiat system is driving our species off a cliff. Instead of arguing red vs blue, it’s time we address the root cause of our societal malaise. It’s time to unfuck the money.</p><p>Fiat money has appeared periodically throughout history, however, it’s the exception not the rule. Throughout most of history, humans coordinated around a free market for money. Gold and silver, mainly. Time to wake up from our fiat money coma.</p>Bitcoin is an Extended Phenotype for humanity<p>Extended Phenotypes are behaviors that extend an organism’s natural capabilities. Beaver dams are a good example. Bitcoin is an Extended Phenotype for humanity — it lowers the trust required for a global society to communicate value, which enables more sophisticated cooperation.</p><p>This offers a unique opportunity to re-architect society based on the separation of money and state aka “natural money.” A huge win for humanity. As such, it’s our duty to form symbiosis with such a force.</p><p>Take another deep breath as we’re fortunate to be alive during such an inflection point.</p>It all starts with individuals forming symbiosis with Bitcoin<p>Bitcoin was the best performing asset of the last decade. This created unimaginable wealth for early adopters. Besides financial gain, individuals also can benefit from bitcoin in other ways. Interestingly, the values imbued into bitcoin seem to rub off on its adherents.</p><p>As a deflationary asset, Bitcoin teaches us to delay consumption today in order to reap greater benefits tomorrow (low time preference).</p><p>In a world fulfilled with uncertainty, Bitcoin provides something to be optimistic about. Rather than change the system from the inside, we can put our energy towards a parallel system.</p><p>Bitcoin forces us to take personal responsibility for our wealth, both a blessing and a curse. In a world that doesn’t value personal responsibility, Bitcoin serves as a wakeup call.</p><p>Partnering with Bitcoin is good for the individual but is it good for mankind?</p>Cryptography is fundamentally about defense<p>Bitcoin is the largest implementation of public key cryptography the world has ever seen. A world with strong cryptography shifts the balance of power towards defense. Defense from tyranny, censorship, overarching governments, and surveillance capitalism.</p><p>Cryptography allows us to assert our natural rights. Bitcoin protects free speech, ensuring we can “vote with our money.” Free speech is the foundation of open societies. Forming symbiosis with Bitcoin preserves freedoms for our future generations. A cause worth fighting for.</p>Bitcoin metabolizes fiat infrastructure<p>We can use fungi to clean up oil spills, halt erosion, create natural pesticides, and even decompose nuclear waste at Chernobyl. In a similar manner, Bitcoin can be used to clean up our dilapidated fiat infrastructure.</p><blockquote>Fungi Fact #1: Fungi have already solved many of our problems, yet we barely understand them. Mycoremediation is a promising new field that leverages our understanding of mycology to improve our environment, essentially “applied mycology.”</blockquote><p>We’re experiencing a period of unprecedented monetary expansion. Bitcoin as a fixed supply monetary good serves as a counter force to unfettered money printing. Short term, individuals using Bitcoin to avoid capital controls and hedge against local currency risk. Long term, Bitcoin may force conservatism onto central banks, starting with developing nations.</p><p>In the richest country in the world (America), average people work for 40 years and never get ahead. The legacy system was designed to siphon wealth from the bottom to the top, most notably during each financial crisis. Since time is money, this forced wealth transfer system should be considered systemic time theft. Make no mistake about it, we should be radicalized by this.</p><p>Every time you buy Bitcoin you’re selling dollars. It’s time to join the peaceful revolution. Occupy UTXOs.</p>Opportunity cost of delaying Bitcoin<p>Think of all the waste created from a fiat system. Bank bailouts, never ending wars, and capital misallocation are greatly reduced (if not eliminated) under a hard money system.</p><p>Each year we delay, we incur increasing opportunity costs. Instead of destroying wealth unnecessarily, how can we invest precious capital into worthy causes?</p><blockquote>“We were promised flying cars and all we got was 140 characters” — Peter Thiel</blockquote><p>What about colonizing mars? Or reducing the risk of civilization “enders” such as pandemics or nuclear war? How about dyson spheres? Asteroid mining? Or eliminating infectious disease and infant mortality for good?</p><p>Let’s embrace the Bitcoin renaissance.</p>Bitcoin wears risk on its sleeve<p>Rather than persist in an opaque financial system designed to enrich the few at the expense of the many, let’s embrace a more transparent financial system. A system where risks are laid bare for all to see, rather than buried under bureaucracy and deception.</p><p>Fiat money is an inorganic system similar to a monocrop industrial farm. Centrally planned, susceptible to disease, unsustainable, and fragile. Fiat offers short term price stability, at the expense of long term systemic risk. In other words, we don’t account for the “fat tail risks” such as banks blowing up or global pandemics. Both examples lead to wealth transfer furthering wealth gaps.</p><p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, is an organic system similar to an old growth rainforest. Fierce competition, incremental growth, sustainable, and antifragile. Bitcoin accepts short term price volatility in exchange for long term systemic stability.</p><p>Bitcoin enables an antifragile monetary system, a huge win for humanity.</p>Bitcoin promotes energy independence<p>Bitcoin has an insatiable demand for low cost energy. Miners scour the earth for cheap energy assets, acting as the energy buyer of last resort. This incentives innovation in low cost energy production such as excess natural gas and stranded hydroelectric.</p><p>Hash rate has been steadily rising, even when price is not. Bitcoin miners are inherently long BTC. What do the miner’s know that you don’t? Rather than putting our heads in the sand, it’s time to form a partnership with reality.</p>♦<p>Bitcoin’s hash rate continues to rise (source)</p><p>Let’s assume Bitcoin continues it’s monetization path. Eventually, Bitcoin mining becomes a matter of national security. Those countries who produce their own energy (and mine Bitcoin) will have further geo-political advantage over countries reliant on importing energy.</p><blockquote>Fungi Fact #2: fossil fuels (hydrocarbons) carry the energy of ancient sunlight originally captured by plants through photosynthesis. Interestingly, earth’s entire supply of coal was formed during the “carboniferous” period which ended ~300m years ago when fungi learned how to digest lignin. Lignin is the polymer that gives plants their rigid structure AND it’s a prerequisite to forming coal. Coal is simply plant material that was “half-digested” by primitive fungi. Modern fungi digest lignin which prevents new coal from being produced.</blockquote><p>This creates another incentive for nations to secure local energy sources — whether from fossil fuels, nuclear plants, renewables, or otherwise. Long term, a world with more localized energy production is a more robust world. Like fungi, Bitcoin is an invisible membrane improving the health of the ecosystem it occupies.</p>Humanity will coalesce on neutral money<p>The current geo-political game rewards those who exert influence over money production. This means large powerful states, politicized money, and special interests groups competing for influence.</p><blockquote>“Give me control of a nation’s money and I care not who makes the laws.” — Mayer Amschel Rothschild</blockquote><p>Instead, Bitcoin is a neutral money. A system designed to prevent special interests from exerting undue influence over the money. This creates a more fair game.</p><p>Why would any government give up control of their printing press?</p><p>In a post-dollar regime, nation-states won’t agree on a new reserve currency. Logically, each state prefers to settle debts in their own currency. We’re already seeing cracks in the dollar hegemony coming out of places like China, Russia, and Iran. Bitcoin is well suited for this problem.</p><p>Bitcoin is fully auditable, hard capped, and offers final settlement quickly. The perfect neutral money for untrusting nation-states to settle debts. Under this light, Bitcoin is money for enemies.</p><p>It’s time to upgrade humanity by forming symbiosis with Bitcoin.</p>Let’s Wrap Up<p>The story of life on earth can be summed up as: success comes to those who form symbiotic relationships with network based organisms (particularly fungi).</p><p>As humble apes, it’s our duty to form a symbiotic relationship with Bitcoin. We must strive to understand this phenomenon so that we may shepherd her through adolescence.</p><p>Just like fungi colonizing dry land was the catalyst for biological evolution on terra, Bitcoin is a catalyst for human evolution.</p><p>Let’s embrace Bitcoin or suffer the fate of the dinosaurs.</p><p>Thank you,<br>Brandon</p><p>Let’s Connect: Follow me here on medium, check out BrandonQuittem.com, and come say hi on twitter.</p><p>P.S. Who’s driving the ship?</p><p>Fungi enabled complex life on earth, which eventually gave way to humans. Now humans are creating the internet (and Bitcoin) which both embody the same mycelial archetype of which we came.</p><p>We didn’t consciously choose to mimic mycelial networks in these designs. However, animals did taxonomically branch off from fungi millions of years ago. Humans came full circle, the student became the teacher.</p><p>Was this inevitable?</p><p>The mycelial archetype appears to be embedded into our species. Over time, network based structures continually appear whether due to embedded wisdom or blind luck. These Mycelial inspired network technologies, once discovered, seem to persist due to their antifragile nature.</p><p>Many people claim we “discovered Bitcoin.” I’m sympathetic to this idea, however it’s more accurate to say we rediscovered Bitcoin. The mycelial archetype is an emergent property of biology which means Bitcoin was inevitable.</p>Acknowledgements<ul><li>Thanks to Gigi, Robert Breedlove, and Nic Carter for providing thoughtful notes during the editing process</li><li>Thanks to the mycological community for inspiring my fascination with fungi (the bitcoin community welcomes you)</li></ul>♦

  ♦Photo by Jason Pofahl on UnsplashYes, but banking must be disintegrated<p>In the past, banking served two distinct functions, typically operated by separate businesses: warehousing wealth and facilitating loans.</p><p>These services are immensely valuable and typically harmless on their own. But it was an integration of banking functions that ultimately cemented the normalization of today’s fractional reserve banking system, allowing for market distortions that gave rise to precarious debt-fuelled bubbles like the one we’re watching unfold right now. It thus incentivized a structural fragility that placed commercial banking in a position of outsized importance to the functioning of society. Banking used to be about providing services to the free market, not the centrepiece.</p><p>The instrument that was manipulated to conflate these two banking functions was commodity money — a cumbersome monetary technology that was inevitably centralized, captured and manipulated to the point that paper claims on it were no longer redeemable.</p><p>With its absolute scarcity, Bitcoin is positioned in stark opposition to the monetary and banking status quo, and can serve as the medium for a philosophical and practical resurgence against the fiat monetary paradigm. Further, it is designed with explicit provisions that can be programmatically harnessed to keep banking roles separate once again.</p><p>While I argue that the Bitcoin communication protocol should explicitly not be defined as “money” in the legal sense, its scarce information space has accrued value such that those who exercise control over some of it have inevitably sought solutions for its security and leverage (warehousing and loans). By understanding the history of traditional banking institutions and the unique features offered by Bitcoin, participants in the Bitcoin network can acknowledge the value offered by these services whilst being careful to harness Bitcoin’s assurances to continue separating these roles.</p>A Brief History of Banking<p>In his great treatise on money and money substitutes, Theory of Money and Credit, Mises demonstrated that fractional-reserve banking was the root cause of the business cycle, arguing that the issuance of uncovered money titles reduced the interest rate in the credit market below its natural level. If, for every dollar of silver held at a bank, the bank had issued two dollar bills with legal title to the one underlying silver dollar, then the circulating supply of money would have doubled. The law of diminishing marginal utility dictates a reduction in the relative demand for the new money and thus reduces the price that can be demanded for access to it (interest rates). Thus, businesses are likely to borrow beyond what they should (it’s cheap to do so), ultimately becoming overleveraged and misallocating resources before a market downturn corrects these inefficiencies.</p>♦How money substitutes are inflated from an underlying asset (fractional reserves). Source<p>Mises’ student, Murray Rothbard, made the mechanics of this lesson more accessible to the layperson in his book The Mystery of Banking. Rothbard argued that it was thanks to the confluence of two distinct forms of banking that a fractional reserve banking system was able to flourish, ultimately creating the fiat paradigm we live under today. These distinct banking functions were those of deposit and loan banking.</p><p>A money warehousing business (a deposit bank) would offer centralized security services to safeguard monies in exchange for a fee paid by the customer. With commodity monies, the returns to violence are high — it makes economic sense for savers to employ a service responsible for defending against theft or loss. These commodity monies also suffer from inconveniences in divisibility and transportability, so another role of the deposit bank was to provide money substitutes (bank notes) that could be carried and exchanged more freely between participants in the economy, with those notes directly convertible to the real money (such as gold) held on deposit at a moment’s notice.</p>♦<p>Separately, credit banking businesses, such as those observed in Venice in the Middle Ages and the Scriveners of 17th C England, might explicitly borrow money from depositors and pay them in the form of interest for the privilege and risk. These certificates of deposit would identify a fixed term; at maturity, funds would be returned to the creditor with an interest payment for taking on the default risk of loaning to the bank. The bank would make money by then lending these funds to other businesses and individuals, say for mortgages, charging a higher interest rate than they were paying to the initial client and pocketing the spread. Risk officers for the credit institute would ensure their debts reached maturity after the money they loaned out was repaid, thus remaining solvent.</p>♦<p>Rothbard’s insight was to acknowledge that both forms of banking businesses would fail occasionally, but that this was a good thing. Bank runs on deposit banks running fractional reserves would hurt defrauded depositors, for the institutions were effectively operating whilst insolvent. But such failures encourage greater due diligence and maintain the money supply in the long run by weeding these institutions out of the economy. Meanwhile, loan banking is explicit in its risks: there is a palpable chance that a credit institute might default if it mismanages its risk exposure. In simple terms, interest rates are the market rate for 1) buying current access to monetary instruments (the time-value of money) and 2) pricing their default risk.</p><p>Rothbard posits that a marriage between the two banking functions put an end to this age and was critical to today’s self-reinforcing cycle of fractional reserve banking, monetary inflation and central banking. He illustrates that central banks lifted the restraints on fractional reserve banking by putting a floor under the whole system that ultimately allowed for excessive credit expansion (printing money) before finally severing any relationship to an underlying asset at all (fiat money).</p>Legal paradigms<p>Another great work of economic literature was written on this issue more recently. Where Mises and Rothbard arrived at a discussion of banking by first analyzing how money comes to be used, Money, Bank Credit and Economic Cycles by Jesús Huerta de Soto starts with the two forms of banking before going on to derive the economic and legal implications of such a system.</p>Irregular deposits<p>De Soto argues that deposit banks dealing in fungible goods like commodity monies were dealing in irregular deposits, meaning that the same precise gold bar didn’t need to be returned to the depositor. Legal ownership of the specific gold bar was transferred to the bank on the proviso that gold of the same quality and quantity was available instantly to the depositor (ipso facto requiring 100% reserves) — the certificate of deposit was a fully covered money title.</p><p>What makes this important for the present discussion is by contrasting it with regular deposits, such as custody of an artwork. Irregular deposits technically transfer legal ownership of the gold to the bank while requiring that it remains fully covered, whereas custody of an artwork clearly doesn’t involve the transfer of ownership. This created a paradigm where the bank was held responsible even for an “act of God”. Thus the bank acted not only as a safekeeper, but the debt they owed to a depositor was so senior that the institutions came to serve as a form of insurance. This would be a moot point for custodying something non-fungible; a destroyed painting can clearly not be returned to the rightful owner.</p><p>If the institution is responsible even for black swan events, then the flaw in any form of fractional reserves is obvious: de Soto compellingly summarizes that “if the depositary has acted fraudulently and has employed the deposited good for his own personal use, he has committed the offense of misappropriation.” Thus, if an institution serving a warehousing role at any point does not have 100% reserves, it is comparable to a painting loaned to a gallery being sold by that gallery. The legal paradigm upholding this intuition existed until surprisingly recently: de Soto draws our attention to a decision by the Court of Paris in 1934 that convicted a banker for violating the expectation of 100% reserves.</p><p>Unfortunately, this rich history and legal precedent has been rendered trivial for now. The technical transfer of ownership involved in irregular deposits allowed for a dishonest play on definitions, with arguments successfully being made by legal counsel that conflated credit contracts (loans) and deposit contracts (warehousing) as essentially the same thing. These functions of banking are now joined at the hip.</p>Bailment<p>If uncovered money titles are the root cause of the business cycle, fraudulent, and enabled by contemporary banking structures, then in Bitcoin it will pay to strictly adhere to a different framework. Fortunately, the “not your keys, not your bitcoin” meme has lent prominence to a particular legal relationship for assets held under custody: bailment.</p><p>When an art collector lends a painting to a gallery, that painting is still the collector’s property. It doesn’t matter that the owner doesn’t currently exert possession or physical control over it. This is called bailment: when physical possession and control are handed to a third party, but the original owner retains legal title.</p><p>As Caitlin Long has been fighting for in Wyoming, legal recognition of a bailment relationship between depositors and a Bitcoin custodian is likely to be an important line of defense for those who need to employ the services of a custodian. Importantly, in a bailment relationship the asset never touches the custodian’s balance sheet, meaning a properly-written contract will ensure that rehypothecation is not legally possible in this scenario (where the custodian uses deposited assets as collateral against their own business loans). By extension, liens ought not be placed on collateral by the business’ debtors (where another party engaged by the custodian, such as an investor, might attest to seniority over assets under custody in a liquidation event).</p>Bitcoin Fixes This<p>Aside from correcting legal definitions, the Bitcoin protocol offers certain assurances that deserve far greater attention in conversations about its custody. Most importantly, if parallels between Bitcoin services and banking are to be found, it should be observed that Bitcoin natively offers tools that can be employed to explicitly delineate between custody and loans.</p><p>Bitcoin is a communication protocol, so it is helpful to first consider two distinct types of Bitcoin information: UTXOs and private keys.</p><p>UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs) encumber the protocol’s scarce information space. Think of the Bitcoin network as if it has space on a hard-drive, except instead of documents adding in size to 120GB, we have UTXOs adding in size to 21M BTC. When people say that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins, what they mean is that there will only ever be a combined total sum of 21M BTC shared among all UTXOs on the network. It’s the information space encumbered by these UTXOs that has accrued market value.</p><p>Bitcoin UTXOs are scarce because one script, and only this one script, is locking up their value on the network. This script is unlocked by a corresponding private key. As far as the Bitcoin protocol is concerned, if one can resolve this script to the network by using the right private key, then they have the right to create a transaction with the UTXO. Because UTXOs are consumed in transactions (resulting in equally valued outputs at the other end), it is notable for our purposes here that they are best employed to explicitly transfer or lend this information space to a third party.</p><p>Private keys, on the other hand, are simply the secrets that allow this activity on the Bitcoin network. Because of the value that these secrets can be used to unlock, safeguarding them is imperative. These secrets can be known by a specialized third party offering certain assurances, much like a password manager, and thus they are well-suited to being “warehoused”.</p>Private Key Warehouses<p>In legacy finance, the role of a qualified custodian has typically been to safeguard legal title to financial products like securities. Perhaps because of confusion around what Bitcoin is, we have seen the emergence of institutions structured more like securities custodians than contemporary banks entering the space. Specialized custodians are explicitly aiming to fill the warehousing role, and they leverage the unique properties of the Bitcoin protocol to achieve this. At Knox, for example, there isn’t simply a big central storage unit and database of “bitcoins”. Customer UTXOs are encumbered by completely segregated private keys in an auditable multi-signature scheme, geographically dispersed and insured for the value of the UTXOs over which they exert control. The infrastructure is set up such that UTXOs can’t be unilaterally spent by internal operators–that requires the cryptographic authorization of the depositor that is in control.</p><p>The importance of this can not be understated. Whilst all Bitcoin participants should still be strongly encouraged to retain exclusive knowledge of their private keys, for many individual and corporate use-cases this is not practical. But warehousing private keys like this is not “reinventing banking” in the way detractors think it means.</p><p>Bitcoin private key warehouses (“custodians”) are tasked with occulting the knowledge of the private key that locks up the network value of their clients.</p><p>Given appropriate legal structures to ensure that keys are shared in a bailment relationship, technical assurances that these third parties cannot single-handedly consume UTXOs, and providing auditability through public addresses on the network, fractional reserves under such a system should not even be possible. At their most basic, these companies simply offer a private contract to keep a secret and occult their customer’s private keys. They’re security services for valuable, secret information with two major functions:</p><blockquote>1. Act as a computational service provider</blockquote><blockquote>Apply signatures (information, text) with secret values (information, text) propagating the results of the computation (information, speech)</blockquote><blockquote>2. Act as a storage service provider</blockquote><blockquote>Hold onto secrets (information, text), to make 1. Possible</blockquote><blockquote>(source)</blockquote><p>One of the reasons for using irregular deposits to custody fungible goods is that it’s impractical and prohibitively costly to return the exact same gold bar to its original depositor. But in Bitcoin, if it’s defined that the private keys themselves are what’s being shared, this is not only possible, but inherent to the system. While it is by no means trivial to provide these assurances and ensure rigorous key segregation, an advantage of Bitcoin’s digital nature quickly becomes apparent: once the methodology is defined and implemented, keeping private keys separate scales incredibly well, unlike a physical gold warehouse where costs would increase in lockstep with the number of customers.</p><p>Furthermore, Bitcoin participants shouldn’t trust that the services they employ are keeping these promises. While a certain segment of the Austrian school would argue to let a self-correcting free banking system simply run its course, we needn’t be so cavalier in Bitcoin. If a Bitcoin holder engages the services of a private key warehouse, auditable addresses should be demanded for the UTXOs that can be controlled by those keys.</p><p>In this context, Bitcoin’s apparent lack of fungibility (distinct UTXOs can be identified) is a feature, not a bug. Irregular deposits as defined by de Soto need not exist when we have a system that can functionally scale to segregate each customer’s private keys and addresses, while also being audited by the customer without needing to query the business’ servers.</p><p>Customers might also consider storing individual keys from a multi-signature wallet across different private key warehouses to provide an extra level of risk segregation assurance, thus requiring an incredibly complex, multi-party collusion to violate their expectation of safekeeping.</p><p>This is the technical, practical and philosophical beauty of multisig: it is consensus-enforced (non-simulated) shared ownership of a scarce asset. Until now, the concept of scarcity has described the exclusive usage and ownership of a given good by a specific individual. If someone is holding the only axe in the village, another can’t hold the same axe at the same time. It is scarce. There can be private contracts that simulate shared ownership amongst many peers, but these are not inherently enforceable, as any party can cheat. Thus, we need legal systems to punish such cheaters after the fact. Bitcoin, however, enforces this shared ownership in its very protocol, to such an extent that Max Hillebrand argues it is no longer simulated, but actual shared ownership. Of course, all of this is under the assumption that the right people keep their secrets safe.</p><p>With the fundamentals established, these assurances can be extended to services where Bitcoin is posted as collateral against a fiat loan. Obviously, a customer posting collateral can’t retain exclusive control over the asset — for example, the service might be forced to liquidate based on certain predefined scenarios. But there are interesting models such as Unchained Capital’s collaborative custody, where collateral posted against a loan is held in a 2-of-3 multi-signature scheme. Unchained Capital holds one key, another is with a third-party key agent (Citadel SPV), and the customer holds the final key. An auditable address for collateral is derived such that the customer can keep an eye on it, and having multiple parties involved can offer certain assurances. The third-party key agent must verify that a liquidation event is legitimate before Unchained Capital can claim those assets, while the customer can also work with the key agent to have collateral returned in the event that Unchained Capital fails or is otherwise unavailable. Remember, the business model for collateralizing loans ought not to be lending collateral back out as if the bank owns it: the model is instead to earn interest on the fiat loan. The collateral can simply be seen as insurance against default, and multisig schemes can be used to enforce this.</p><p>One final note: another reason for the deposit banks of old was for scalability. Bank notes served a legitimate use-case for divisibility and transport in a commodity money system. While there’s no guarantee for future scaling, the Bitcoin network doesn’t yet need the financial intermediary role of a money substitute, and it is hoped that the Lightning Network Protocol or a future protocol layer will provide this scalability that banknotes once provided without needing to derive centralized substitutes.</p>UTXO loan-banking<p>A clearly distinct class of financial infrastructure has also emerged in the early financialization of Bitcoin: interest-bearing accounts. If someone sends UTXOs to Ledn on the promise of earning a 3.6% return, it should be distinctly understood that the legal title to the information space encumbered by those UTXOs no longer belongs to the depositor. Rather, Ledn exercises property rights, ownership and control, with a debt owed to the depositor and interest paid out as a fee for the privilege.</p><p>As in historic loan banking, these UTXO loans function largely as you’d expect. There are typically term requirements for the deposit (the depositor can reclaim possession of the information space after a month or longer), and it is understood that the depositor is taking on the default risk of the company with which they hold this interest-bearing account.</p><p>If there is any gripe with this model, it ought to be in the marketing. Often, these products are implicitly marketed to help Bitcoin holders “start saving”. Where the loan banking model explicitly carries more risk than one would expect from a contemporary bank account (e.g. there is no lender of last resort and no FDIC-style depositor insurance in Bitcoin for now), it’s a savings account at a traditional bank that this market positioning brings to mind. To be blunt, these loans are more like an investment in the default risk of a fintech startup, while “saving” in the Bitcoin paradigm is a term best suited to securing private keys. After all, the supply cap of Bitcoin theoretically means that the purchasing power of UTXOs is preserved, unlike in the inflationary fiat paradigm where purchasing power is systematically diminished and investment is required simply to save. That aside, the fact that this loan structure has emerged clearly separated from the role of private key warehouse is welcome.</p>Subversion of Bitcoin<p>Having spelled out the features that Bitcoin offers its network participants, now isn’t the time to be complacent. Note that some companies are, indeed, engaging in practices that might simply recreate the trappings of the legacy financial system. Individual caution is needed.</p><p>I have written in the past about my thoughts regarding BlockFi, for the company appears indifferent to the opportunities of the Bitcoin protocol put forward in this article. BlockFi’s interest-bearing account is very high risk, but this is transparent enough and one might have few qualms with that (an 8.6% return on some deposits should be the only market indicator you need to establish this conclusion).</p><p>What might be worth more consideration in the context of the current thesis is that Blockfi also offers a bitcoin-collateralized loan. Presumably, one might expect the company to hold the Bitcoin collateral in an auditable, segregated wallet under a bailment relationship — as with Unchained Capital, you’d expect that their business model is to earn interest on the fiat loan being repaid while safely custodying the UTXOs posted as collateral. Alas, the UTXOs held under both the interest-bearing and collateralized schemes appear to be commingled and the company reserves the right to rehypothecate — that is, Bitcoin posted as collateral can be re-lent by BlockFi as if it were theirs, exposing depositors to additional counterparty default risk. This is very much akin to the contemporary banking system. The market is the great arbiter of such trade-offs, but given the assurances offered by the Bitcoin protocol it might be considered that competitors provide better assurances in the way they handle collateral.</p>Bitcoin Can Work With Banking<p>As most would have expected, it’s becoming very clear that Bitcoin is being financialized at a rapid rate. Fortunately, the nature of something truly scarce means that fractional reserves can not be sustained for long. Whether by design or accident, such schemes will tend to be discovered and collapse in the absence of a lender of last resort. But while this secures Bitcoin against any systemic risk — blocks will still be mined every ten minutes, oblivious to what participants do with it — such failures can cause a lot of suffering to those defrauded by them.</p><p>Bitcoin offers assurances that ought to be harnessed by alert network participants to ensure the safety of their holdings. By forcing a segregation between services akin to deposit banks (custodians) and loan banks, and demanding certain verifiable assurances from both, these services and participants alike can thrive while supporting the early financialization of Bitcoin and avoiding the trappings of Wall St. Both of these banking functions, with their different risks, are likely necessary for the ethical financialization of Bitcoin, so long as one remains alert.</p><p>Special thanks to Max Hillebrand, Ben kaufman and Ben Prentice for review and guidance, Stephan Livera for pointers and as always Thib and Daskalov for brainstorming, support and reviews.</p><p>Knox is working on the ethical financialization of Bitcoin with a focus on private key custody.

  <p>By Ross Ulbricht</p>♦<p>I was told there were some questions about my wave labels in BbR #9, notably the intermediate subwaves of waves Ⓑ and Ⓒ of II. If you aren’t an Elliott Wave geek, you can safely skip this. Or, if you want to become an Elliott Wave geek, jump right in!</p><p>Taken out of context, wave Ⓑ could look impulsive at first glance. The 3rd wave extension in wave (C) makes wave (C) dominate the whole structure. Wave (C) is an impulse, so the whole thing starts looking impulsive. One could label (A) as (1), (B) as (2), 4 of (C) as (4) and 5 of (C) as (5). However, to me, this looks very ugly in the cycle-degree superstructure. Wave Ⓐ would have to be seen as a puny wave II that did not match the psychological extreme of wave I. Or, if you took the labels down two degrees, interpreting Ⓐ as (4) and Ⓑ as 1 of (5), the waves look way too massive to be of intermediate and minor degree. Given the choice between the three, the way I labeled Ⓑ in BbR #9 seems best.</p><p>Regarding the subwaves of wave (C), someone correctly pointed out that according to orthodox Elliott Wave Theory, there is no 3–3–3 correction. A zig-zag is 5–3–5, a flat is 3–3–5, and a triangle is 3–3–3–3–3. You can also have double (and triple) 3s in which two (or three) of the above three structures are connected by one (or two) of those structures. In that case, instead of labeling the correction A-B-C, it is labeled W-X-Y (or in the case of a triple: W-X-Y-X-Z) with W and Y (and Z) being the “3s” and the Xs being the connecting waves.</p><p>In practice, there is no difference between a double 3 with two flats connected by a zig-zag for example and a 3–3–3 structure, except you have to use the XYZ labels.</p><p>I see no reason to make the distinction and find the XYZ labeling confuses more than it illuminates. To me, it makes more sense and is easier to follow if you use ABC labeling for double 3s, so I have opted to do that here. Still, my labeling of the wave (C) substructure was only tentative in BbR #9, so it may turn out that wave II is an orthodox flat, and wave (C) will subdivide into 5. Time will tell.</p>♦

  <p>by Ross Ulbricht</p><p>I was glad to hear that my last post (BbR #9) got everyone thinking and talking about the future price of bitcoins. I have mentioned it before, but I just wanted to clarify why I am doing this series in the first place. As everyone knows, I was one of the first to recognize the potential of Bitcoin. I was a bit preoccupied at the end of wave ③ (I saw a chart of that peak for the first time at my own trial). But later, I saw that wave ④ was over before wave ⑤ had progressed more than 1%. And finally, I called the wave ⑤ peak on the nose, though I was unsure if it was (5) of ⑤ or (3) of ⑤.</p>♦Fig. from previous post (BbR #9)<p>Until that last call, I had kept those insights to myself, not wanting to mislead anyone, especially because my access to information is so limited from within prison. However, it felt good to help someone lock in profit at $20,000 and avoid the brunt of wave II. So, cautiously, I decided to start this series so that I might be able to help others navigate what is an extremely volatile market. It may be that I even have an advantage being in prison because I am less influenced by day-to-day events and can take a detached, long-term perspective.</p><p>Speculative markets like bitcoin are psychological traps. In hindsight, anyone can look at the spectacular rise of Wave I and say “if you just buy and hold, you’ll get fabulously rich,” but to actually do this is not easy. Those primary-degree waves (circled numbers and letters) end with extreme psychological consensus. The $20,000 peak was not that long ago. Do you remember what the consensus was like? Extreme optimism reigned. Six- or seven-figure prices were just over the horizon. Every alt-coin was the next big thing. Everything pointed to one conclusion: buy now! Anyone issuing warnings to get out were ignored, laughed off stage or buried with a thousand “good” reasons why prices could only go up.</p><p>The sad thing is the exact opposite will be true at the bottom of wave II. There will be a thousand reasons to sell, and anyone calling it a huge buying opportunity (as I have) will be ignored or worse. Or, if wave II drags on long enough, it could be that Bitcoin just becomes uninteresting, like yesterday’s news, with wave I feeling like a hype cycle that has played out. That is also a hard environment to hodl through or buy into, but to get the most out of wave II, one must.</p><p>Of course I could be wrong. No one knows the future, and no one controls this market. What I am trying to do is merely map out the most likely scenarios as I see them, so if they play out you won’t be as easily caught up in the drama of the moment and can act instead of react. Are there still short-term bullish possibilities? Yes. No view of the market is ever 100% certain, and you never bet the whole farm on it. That’s the nature of forecasting. And you must be ready to adjust your view as new information comes in.</p><p>Thankfully, you don’t need to be right 100% of the time to be a profitable investor. In fact, you can be wrong more often than not, so long as your winners are big enough and your losers small enough. I recommend “Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom” by Van Tharp for the fundamentals of risk management and systemic investing, and “The Elliott Wave Principle” and “The Socionomic Theory of Finance” by Robert Prechter for an intro to Elliott Wave and its broader socionomic context.</p><p>For those of you upset by my short-term bearish forecast, I want to reiterate I am still bullish long-term. It is possible that wave III will be even more impressive than wave I, as 3rd waves often are. If we consider $0.06 to be the start of wave I and $20,000 the end, then wave I drove prices up by 333,333x. If wave II takes prices down to $1,000 and wave III is as big as wave I, then wave III will drive prices to $333 million. Assuming 21 million bitcoins, that’s a market cap of $7 quadrillion. That’s more than ten times the current GDP of all humanity. So the point is — long term — the sky is the limit. The remainder of wave II and the start of wave III will seem like insignificant fluctuations by the time wave III is under way. Decades from now, anything below $20,000 will seem cheap.</p><p>With all that being said, what you can count on from me is my honest view of the market, regardless of how popular that may be. As noted above, it will often be most unpopular at just the times when it is needed most. In fact, if I find everyone agreeing with me, that will be a red flag and I may be in the market’s psychological trap and need to consider other possibilities!</p>♦

  ♦Photo by Harrison Kugler on UnsplashIt is one of Bitcoin’s greatest strengths.<p>Unlike financial markets such as Wall Street, Bitcoin works all the time. You can make Bitcoin transactions 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As such, Bitcoin is the only true free market in the world.</p><p>At the current rate of production of the new blocks of its Blockchain, Bitcoin is expected to have its third Halving in about 20 days. Around May 13, 2020, the daily production of Bitcoin will be halved.</p><p>From 1800 new Bitcoins produced per day, it will decrease to 900. A real supply shock for Bitcoin will take place, and it is going to be huge for the price of Bitcoin in the following months.</p><p>This reduction in the supply of new Bitcoin mined will occur no matter what. This is the advantage of Bitcoin’s monetary policy which is programmatic. It does not depend on any arbitrary decision of human beings.</p><p>Better yet, Bitcoin’s monetary policy is the antithesis of what the Fed and other central banks have been doing for years now. Their only answer to all the ills of the economy is to print more and more money.</p><blockquote>Central banks are thus pursuing quantitative easing policies that constantly devalue what everyone own.</blockquote><p>Obviously, some are more affected than others by the currency devaluations that result from these unconventional monetary policies. As you can imagine, these are the poorest people first and foremost.</p><p>Bitcoin’s monetary policy, on the other hand, is much more protective for its users. Quantitative hardening is the name given to this monetary policy followed by Bitcoin. The evolution of the price of Bitcoin since its creation clearly shows the virtues of quantitative hardening.</p><p>This policy of quantitative hardening is constantly proving its superiority over quantitative easing.</p><p>As a Bitcoin user, quantitative hardening is essential for you. You ensure a better future for yourself. You protect what you own, and you give yourself the right to live on your own terms.</p><blockquote>In a world as uncertain as the one we live in, Bitcoin is an essential guarantee.</blockquote><p>Having the right to save money and think about the future becomes even more essential when you have children. As such, many underestimate the importance of Bitcoin in building a better world for our children.</p><p>Yet, this is one of the still too little known advantages of Bitcoin.</p><p>We all want our children to live in a better world, or at least one that is equivalent to ours. With the current monetary and financial system, you can hardly imagine such a thing.</p><p>It must be said that the Fed, as well as other central banks, locks you into a kind of Monopoly game in which you can only suffer currency devaluations without ever having a word to say.</p><p>The famous Rule 11 of Monopoly was written at a very particular time. It was written in the mid-1930s when the Great Depression hit the United States hard. It was written primarily to denounce the lawless capitalism that had plunged the United States into crisis.</p><p>Almost 90 years later, it seems that no lessons have yet been learned from the past.</p><p>In order to escape from this metaphorical prison in which the Fed locks you up, you have no choice but to use Bitcoin, which is your “Get ouf of Fiat System Free” card. This famous card that will allow you to access a better future while helping your children to benefit from it.</p><p>The fact that Bitcoin adapts to the multiple needs of its users would almost make us forget its basic functions. Recently, a transaction among so many others caught my attention on the Bitcoin network.</p><blockquote>An anonymous person was able to send 5,055 Bitcoins from one end of the world to the other in just 10 minutes for a transaction fee of only $0.25.</blockquote><p>This transaction was included in block 625,437 of the Bitcoin Blockchain.</p>♦34 million transferred on Bitcoin network for just $0.25 in fees<p>The $34 million transferred for such low fees is another reminder that Bitcoin remains the best solution for cross border money transfers.</p><p>The more time passes, the more obvious it becomes that the liquidity injections already decided upon by the Fed and other central banks will not be enough. In the coming weeks, new extraordinary measures will have to be taken.</p><blockquote>The bill will probably exceed $10T, which will push the money in circulation at the global level to over $100 trillion very quickly in the future.</blockquote><p>At the government level, the stimulus packages that have been decided upon around the world will once again be financed by public debt. Thus, the $2T plan decided by the United States will increase its debt to over $24T.</p><p>At the world level, this debt has already reached more than $70T.</p><p>The time when a country with a debt of more than 100% of its GDP was an exception seems to be over. Now, a public debt of more than 100% has become the norm for the majority of the world’s major economic powers.</p><p>All this poses a threat to the future of your children, and raises questions about the real value of fiat money as I was wondering previously:</p><blockquote>Does Your Fiat Money Still Have Any Value?</blockquote><p>From my point of view, the answer is negative. For your part, I leave it to you to make up your own mind, but I have no doubt that the future decisions that will be taken in the context of the economic crisis that is beginning will convince you.</p><p>The real questioning of the monetary and financial system that is emerging as a result of this new economic crisis could well be remembered in the future as the tipping point for Bitcoin.</p><p>Once again, we come back to our children who will be the only judges of all this in the future.</p>♦<p>Bitcoin Adapts to the Specific Needs of Each of Its Users was originally published in In Bitcoin We Trust on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  ♦<p>For centuries, production in capitalist countries seems to progress in some kind of “cycles”. Every few years, the economy experiences a period of sharp economic growth which is then upset by a collapse of businesses and a high unemployment rate — a recession. This cyclical movement of the market, repeatedly going from an economic boom to bust, is known as the “business cycle”. Social scientists of multiple disciplines have suggested numerous explanations for this phenomenon, from “under-consumption” to some psychological propensity. Yet, so far, no popular counter-measure pursued has solved this problem. Central banks have evidently failed to “cure” this alleged “market failure”, and despite the enormous, continuous growth in their power and influence, we once again seem to be at the beginning of a devastating recession.</p><p>Despite the confidence on the side of central bankers in their ability to handle this issue, it seems that, especially since the last crisis of 2008, the public is losing patience with the current system. People are getting fed up with footing the bill for the mistakes of the financial system, and very justly so. The scheme at work is already clear and visible. The economists grievously fail, and the taxpayer pays the costs (and their salaries)¹. It’s obvious that this system cannot continue. Yet, the right alternative — the solution — is still far from obvious. Nevertheless, the mainstream and most academia appear to agree on one thing, that money must be managed by the government, that is, through central planning.</p><p>They tend to look at the economy as a machine — some kind of a black box which is running on an engine fuelled by money. The more “fuel” you throw in, the quicker the engine will go, and the faster the economy will move. While the different economic schools and doctrines usually provide different theories and explanations, their practical controversies and disagreement are primarily around at what point injecting more “fuel” would cause the “machine” to run too fast, overheat and eventually blow up. That is, how much money would be too much for the economy and lead to problems or even to hyperinflation. Regardless of the many differences between the popular doctrines, the issue of money is where you will find their most enthusiastic agreement. The money supply² must always increase! Printing, bank credit expansion, “liquidity injection”, “quantitative easing”, public deficit spending, even outright handouts — just throw it out of a helicopter if that’s what it takes — but you must never let the inflow of money slow down!³</p><p>This approach of monetary “engineering” is undoubtedly the most popular, and has guided policies for more than a century. But, considering its failure to deliver on any of its promises⁴, there seems to be a good reason for questioning this approach. In fact, if there is anything to learn from the last hundred years, it is that government control over money, namely central banking, doesn’t promote prosperity. Expanding money and credit does not cure the problem of the business cycle (or any other issues for that matter) — this approach has failed every time. The common analogy that the economy is like a machine operated by the state fueling it with money might sound sensible to some, but does it really fit? Is the theory we have learned to accept, quite by default, actually correct?</p><p>In this article, I will present the “heterodox” approach of the “Austrian school” of economics. The Austrian school approaches the questions of economics from the view of individual actions and incentives, looking at the economy as an “organic” complex resulting from the many actions of individuals. Its theory of the business cycle is probably one of its central, though most controversial, achievements. The purpose of this article, however, is not merely to explain the Austrian Business Cycle Theory (ABCT), and certainly not to justify its validity. Many other books already provide such brilliant expositions⁵. The goal of this article is to discuss the possibility of economic reform which builds upon the theoretical works of the Austrian school. My aim here is to lay down the argument for how Bitcoin could be the key to preventing the business cycle — enabling greater and more sustainable economic growth.</p>Economic Growth<p>So to begin our discussion, we shall first look at how a healthy economy grows. Adam Smith, the “father of economics,” has attributed economic growth chiefly to the division of labor, that is, to the specialization of individuals in performing specific tasks. However, there is a much more critical aspect of human progress which Smith overlooked. As Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian school of economics explained, it is the availability of “factors of production,” that is capital, on which economic growth is dependent, and which also sets the limits for the division of labor.⁶</p><p>Capital, or capital goods, are the goods which are not used for direct consumption, but are used in the process of producing other goods, eventually reaching to consumers as “consumption goods.” Menger has explained this difference by referring to different “orders” of goods. The goods which consumers directly use, like food, clothes, and cars, are the goods of the “lowest, first order.” If we take bread, for instance, then we could say that flour is a “second-order” good in the process of producing it. Wheat can then be called a third-order good, and the land on which the wheat grew upon a fourth-order good. The order of a good is nothing inherent in it, but is rather “a product of reasoning” based on how a person intends to use it. Therefore, the same good can be of different orders when employed at different stages of production. The point here is, of course, not the assignment of the specific orders of goods, but understanding that production is a structure with varying “depth”. Furthermore, as we will now see, the higher the orders of goods we use in a production process get, that is, the “deeper” our production structure is, the more we will be able to produce.</p><p>As an example, consider a lumberjack cutting wood with an ax, as compared to another one which uses an electrical chainsaw. Clearly, the latter will be much more productive at his work, as the capital good he employs is much superior to the one used by the former lumberjack. But, it is no less clear that the chainsaw requires the employment of much higher order goods to assemble, its production process is longer and more complex. While an ax could be produced even by primitive people, from quite simple raw materials, the chainsaw requires the use of industrial equipment, like an engine and a power source, which by themselves require the use of many other goods, and so on. In other words, the chainsaw necessitates the accumulation of much (much) more capital and the use of much higher orders of goods to produce — it needs a “deeper” production structure.</p><p>Menger’s student, economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, has termed this property of increasing length and complexity of production, the “roundaboutness” of production processes. The more “roundabout” a production process is, the more and higher-order capital goods it means are employed. His choice of the term “roundabout” attempts to signify a crucial concept. To produce more and better consumer goods, we must first take the time to create more capital goods. By “deviating” from the straight line we wish to follow to get to our main goal of producing the final consumption goods (like firewood), taking the additional effort and going first to produce something else (the capital needed, like the ax or chainsaw), we can manufacture much better, or a greater quantity of, final products. The process of human progress, of improving welfare and material conditions of people, could most adequately be described as the process of capital accumulation. Our development and economic growth is dependent on and limited by the availability of capital goods for production. Thus, to understand the actual process of economic growth, the next step to look at is how capital accumulation works.</p><p>Accumulating capital means increasing the level of savings that a person holds. It means withholding consumption of goods and, instead, saving them and employing them in further production. When considering an individual working alone, like a fisherman building himself a fishing rod, the process of capital accumulation is quite straightforward. The fisherman delays his “production” of fish in the present and instead takes the time to build a fishing rod. He will need to postpone his consumption of fish while producing the rod but will later be able to use it to catch many more fish. Eventually, he will have more capital savings (the rod) and will be able to produce (fish) more efficiently. However, when discussed in the framework of the market economy, the process suddenly becomes much more “abstract” and harder to follow. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to understand the specifics of capital accumulation in the market economy.</p><p>The market economy is a system of the division of labor. It is a “framework” in which private individuals own capital, exchange goods and services, and cooperate to achieve their ends. Its most important property is the existence of a pricing system for all traded products and services, denominated in a common medium of exchange — money. Therefore, the allocation of capital in the market economy is done mostly by using the money prices of goods.</p><p>Most people tend to confuse money and money prices. When we say, for instance, that our lumberjack saved 100$ by producing firewood, what we mean is that he created something priced on the market as worth 100$. If he decided to use the firewood for consumption, he may do so either directly — for example by using it to make fire, or indirectly, by selling it for 100$ of cash, spending that on something he will actually consume. If, however, he prefers to increase his savings, he could refrain from consuming the wood, storing it for later, or using it to make new work tools (capital). Or again, as the usual course of the market economy goes, he could sell it for cash, and either save that money to spend later, spend it now on buying more capital goods to use, or lend it to or invest it in some enterprise. The more capital goods people accumulate, either directly by owning them, or indirectly, through money savings, lending, and investing, the more will the economy progress.⁷</p><p>As we now see, the most important force of economic growth is saving and accumulating capital, which requires deferring consumption of the goods produced. Therefore, we now face a new question. How long will a man be willing to defer his consumption in order first to accumulate more capital? In other words, how does a man, and eventually the economy as a whole, decide the length of production? That is, whether to focus on short term production of relatively fewer consumer goods sooner, or longer-term production, employing more “roundabout” processes to produce more (or better) consumption goods later.</p><p>The answer is that people decide according to their time preference. It is a generally accepted⁸ that all else being equal, a person will always prefer to satisfy his needs sooner rather than later (as for every person time is finite and the future is uncertain). This means that, for people to defer their present consumption, the future output expected from taking longer (more roundabout) production efforts must be high enough to compensate for this delay in consumption. Put simply, people value time, they prefer to attain their ends sooner rather than later, and the extent to which they value the present more than the future is their level of time preference.</p><p>Having high time preference, a person will be less willing to defer his consumption, and will be more present-oriented in his economic activity. In contrast, a person with lower time preference will prefer to wait longer and take more roundabout processes, as they will sufficiently compensate him for the increase in production length. We may say that the time preference of people is what regulates the length of production in the economy.</p><p>The lower time preference is, the more future-oriented people are, and the more capital they save and accumulate to enhance productivity and develop the economy.⁹</p><p>Again, in the case of an isolated economy of a single individual, there will not be much further question of how the process goes. In such a case, the same person does everything by himself. Just to clarify, retaking the example of a fisherman, if his time preference is relatively high, we will not be willing to defer his consumption to make the fishing rod first. However, if he has a low enough time preference, he will prefer this more “roundabout’’ process of making the fishing rod while catching no fish at first and then use it to increase his productivity. But as we said before, the process looks different when we introduce the division of labor of the market economy. In the market, production is directed according to consumers’ demand¹⁰, reflected through the price system.</p><p>Time is a factor of production. In fact, it is the only factor of production without which no production is possible. As such, time, that is, the time preference of the consumers, also has its money price in the market, namely, the interest rate. The interest rate is the price required to withhold capital from others for a certain time¹¹. As people save more, thus lower their time preference, it means that they are willing to delay their consumption for a lower “compensation”¹² compared to what they used to, and will accordingly offer their funds at a lower cost (interest rate).</p><p>As the interest rate gets lower, capital becomes cheaper for entrepreneurs to obtain. Projects which were previously too long or too capital intensive to be profitable suddenly become viable investments, as more capital is available at lower costs. Thus entrepreneurs will find it profitable to expand their businesses and open new initiatives, and consequently will expand and deepen the production structure by taking more roundabout production processes. What happens is that, by taking on more loans (or investments) from savers, entrepreneurs will be able to purchase the capital saved by the people who lowered their time preference (as lower time preference means more saving). This is how new capital accumulated gets into the production structure of the market economy, how resources are mobilized and the division of labor taking place. Prices serve as the guiding indicator for producers in the market economy, and the price of time, the interest rate, serves as an especially important indicator, as it is present in all imaginable processes of production and regulates their length and use of the available resources.</p><p>As these more roundabout processes of production mature, there will be a greater supply of goods (could be both capital and consumption goods) in the economy. People will then be able to lower their time preference and increase their savings without diminishing (or even while increasing) consumption. In a sense, there is a positive feedback loop, where lower time preference and longer-term view allows production to expand, eventually making more goods available, allowing to reduce time preference even further and so on. This is the process of civilization, by which humans have raised themselves from poverty and destitution to the modern prosperity, relative to past generations, that we have today.</p>♦The Business Cycle<p>So far, we have not seen any issue which should lead to the appearance of the business cycle — the recurring periods of great economic boom followed by a collapse of projects throughout the whole economy. So now we shall turn to our main problem here, what, indeed, is the cause of the business cycle?</p><p>According to the Austrian theory, developed initially by Böhm-Bawerk’s student, economist Ludwig von Mises, the root of the problem is to be found in the intervention of governments and central banks with the money supply, more accurately, with their efforts to increase the money supply and expand credit.¹³ In simple terms, what credit expansion means here is the creation of money, out of thin air.¹⁴ There are many ways today by which governments aim to expand credit, like Quantitative Easing, fractional reserve banking¹⁵ — which is insured by the taxpayer (implicitly or explicitly) and fully regulated by the state, and various other accounting schemes and financial “tools.” Still, the essence of all those schemes is to increase the supply of money and credit in the economy, essentially out of thin air.</p><p>So what are the effects of such credit expansion on the process of economic progress we have discussed thus far? The initial effect from such credit expansion will be a drop in the interest rate. As the new money finds its way to (or, as usually happens, originates in) the banking system, banks will be in a position to offer cheaper loans, simply from having a greater supply of money available. This reduction of the interest rate has, for a long time, been the main (declared) objective of governments when pursuing credit expansion.</p><p>As we have seen, a lower (natural) interest rate is indeed correlated with economic growth, as it reflects lower time preference. From this, many economists have taken the leap to the conclusion that a lower interest rate promotes economic growth, and that it is therefore the government’s responsibility to push it as low as possible. However, we know that the interest rate is not like a metric on a machine, it is the reflection of the time preference of people. Attempting to promote economic growth by lowering the interest rate with credit expansion is like trying to “promote” rain by pushing down the pointer on a barometer. You will achieve nothing more than rendering the barometer defective and cause those who rely on it to make wrong projections. This is exactly what happens with the interest rate. As we said, entrepreneurs and businessmen rely on the interest rate to determine the length and complexity of their production efforts. The interest rate is their indication for how much capital is available to use for production. As central banks lower the interest rate, it lures entrepreneurs into expanding production and to commit to more roundabout processes than they otherwise would have taken. It distorts the economic data guiding entrepreneurs, leading them to make systematic errors, and ultimately misallocating capital.</p><p>At first, the expansion in production will cause an apparent economic boom, with more businesses opening, new constructions launching, wages rising and a general increase in economic activity. Nevertheless, this economic boom is necessarily unsustainable, as it relies on a defecting indicator for capital availability — the artificially low interest rate.</p><p>The essential problem caused by the artificially low interest rate is that it creates the illusion that there is more capital available for production than there really is. A “real” drop in the interest rate comes from a drop in the time preference of people, from the greater accumulation and saving of capital. The price system is the information system of the market economy, and the interest rate is the indicator informing entrepreneurs of changes in savings, in the capital available for production. However, when the government artificially lowers the interest rate, there is no change in the available capital. People did not reduce their consumption, nor did they increase their savings in any other way. There is no new capital to use in production, but with the artificially lower interest rate, entrepreneurs already rely on the existence of such additional capital in order to complete their expanded production processes. In other words, the increase in production started during the boom is unsustainable, it is impossible to complete, and will therefore have to end with a collapse.</p><p>But let us take a moment to see what this process would actually look like. With lower interest rates, as we said, entrepreneurs will expand production. They will take on new loans and use them to buy more capital goods. Now, since the supply of capital did not increase, but the demand for it from entrepreneurs rose, the prices of capital goods will have to rise to match the new demand. As the prices of the higher order goods rise, entrepreneurs will be forced to take new loans to obtain the capital they need to complete production. There will be a higher demand for loans and the interest rate, still artificially low, will be pushed back to the level where it corresponds to the true time preference of people. With the interest rate back up, and with the prices of capital goods adjusted to the new money supply, the shortage of capital to complete all production becomes apparent. The submarginal projects started during the boom, or malinvestments, as Mises called them, will again appear as unprofitable and will have to be liquidated. The final result of this process is a massive collapse of businesses across all the economy and a consequent high unemployment, that is, a recession.</p><p>During the recession, malinvestments are liquidated, and the capital invested in them is either lost or reallocated to more profitable projects. The recession is, in a sense, the re-adjustment of the market to the real capital and time preference of people. It is the market curing itself and recovering, wiping out the mistakes made on the basis of distorted information, stopping to waste scarce capital on unrealisable projects, and reallocating capital based on the corrected information.</p><p>In short, the business cycle is a period of unsustainable expanded production, induced by lower interest rates, followed by the realization that the expanded production is unsustainable, and the consequent collapse of businesses.</p>♦<p>So what can we do to stop the recession? Unfortunately, once credit expansion has started causing the illusory economic boom, the eventual bust is inevitable. Capital is being wasted, and there is no way to make such malinvestments truly sustainable. Yet, basing their efforts on a different theory, governments and central banks still believe it is possible to artificially “combat” the recession by accelerating credit expansion even further. However, their repeated failures to handle those cycles leaves us a very good reason to question their theories and approach.</p><p>If the government pushes credit expansion even further, it will be able to reduce the interest rate again, essentially returning us to the first step of the cycle, but with the malinvestments made continuing to waste additional capital. Still, it is crucial to understand that they cannot do this forever. The boom is unsustainable, and preserving the malinvestments it induced by lowering interest rates at an accelerating pace will not change this fact, but only postpone it from being exposed, further delaying an amplified and inescapable market adjustment. Eventually, either capital is exhausted or a hyper-inflation ensues.¹⁶ Delaying the bust only aggravates the issue, causing a greater bust later, as it allows malinvestments to continue to waste scarce capital.</p><p>As the cycle becomes inevitable once the interest rate is distorted, the only way to stop the business cycle is to prevent interest rate manipulations. That is, we must prevent credit expansion from taking place. This is the approach taken by the Austrian economists, of which many, including Mises himself, suggested such reforms for preventing credit expansion. These were usually along the lines of returning to a rigid gold standard, having free market competition in money, or making large banking reforms, but among all their proposals, two, unfortunately contradictory, things are common.</p><p>First is their goal — their essence is limiting the power of governments and their control over money and credit. Second is their practical approach, which essentially amounts to limiting the government’s power *by asking the government* to limit itself. Such a thing is quite unprecedented. Governments will not voluntarily reduce their power over anything, nor will they admit of making such a huge mistake as causing business cycles for so many years, as adopting any such proposal must mean.</p><p>Many of the Austrian economists have realised this fault in their works to achieve any practical result, which led Friedrich A. Hayek, Mises’s most well-known student, to the following conclusion:</p><blockquote>“I don’t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can’t take it violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can’t stop.” — F. A. Hayek</blockquote><p>This is precisely where Bitcoin comes in. While Hayek’s quote is from 1984, about two and a half decades before Bitcoin was invented, hardly anyone has ever described Bitcoin better than that. The idea of Bitcoin, as Satoshi wrote, is to create “a peer to peer electronic cash system”. That is, money which is operated by a global and open network, without depending on any central authority. No single participant or a specific group is necessary for operating Bitcoin — no one can shut it down, because there is no one Bitcoin depends on to continue to work. It is as Hayek said, a system which takes “the thing” (money) out of the hands of government, and that they can’t stop.¹⁷</p><p>This is the most important difference between Bitcoin and gold, which most Austrians still currently endorse. The gold standard was operated by governments and banks, and cannot work without such a system of a few central institutions holding most of the gold reserves. Without such a system, all gold payments will have to be physically delivered. Such an option was already impractical decades ago, but today, with all the digital payments made, it is just unthinkable. This means that the gold standard can only function if approved by governments, but is doomed as soon as the political attitude shifts unfavourably. It is this very weakness of the gold standard that enabled governments to effectively confiscate it (Executive Order 6102) and eventually completely remove it (Executive Order 11615). This weakness of gold is what Bitcoin aims to fix. It is “an unstoppable force” — money which does not ask for permission from politicians to operate.</p>Bitcoin and the Business Cycle<p>But assuming for a moment the use of Bitcoin as money, there is still the question of how would it help prevent the business cycle? Bitcoin has a few notable attributes in this regard.</p><p>First, Bitcoin has a predetermined fixed supply limit. It is produced by a mechanism of proof of work, a digital “gold mining” like process, and limited to 21 million units ever to be created. This is slightly different from gold, where mining can continue to unknown extent, but the important property they share is that their supply cannot be manipulated by government decree. No paper signed by politicians could make more Bitcoin or gold appear, unlike the system of fiat money we have today. This means that, with Bitcoin, governments will not be able to inflate the base supply of money. This is the first necessary step towards limiting credit expansion in the economy. But, while necessary, it is not enough by itself, as it still does not directly limit the ability of banks to expand credit.</p><p>This leads us to the second important way by which Bitcoin could help prevent the business cycle, and on which we have already touched briefly. It is the fact that Bitcoin works without intermediaries, it is peer to peer cash. It allows people to hold their money by themselves, without having to give (more correctly, lend)¹⁸ it to a bank to be able to make transactions. This will ensure a clear separation between money held by individuals for their regular expenses (as cash balances), and the money they wish to save and can be invested productively in the economy through the banking system. In other words, it could limit the part of the money, the reserves, held by banks, thus limiting their power to excessively expand credit. When people can use their money — without relying on financial institutions to make the transactions — they can choose what amount they wish to hold themselves to transact from, and what they prefer to save and invest in the economy, and entrust banks with managing the latter. Such a system will make sure that the supply of money and money substitutes (credit) in circulation remains stable, preventing credit expansion and the consequent business cycle.</p><p>Even if banking for “demand deposits”, that is for money held for regular expenses, continues, the fact that Bitcoin has a rigid supply will force banks to be responsible with their credit issuance or they will risk a bank run. Furthermore, since Bitcoin is a digital asset, it is much cheaper to store, verify and transfer than with physical assets. That is, Bitcoin does not need a Fort Knox to benefit from economies of scale in storing and handling it. Therefore, the barriers of entrance for new competing banks will be lower, and there will be better grounds for free competitive banking. This improved competition could force banks to be more responsible in managing reserves¹⁹, thus limiting credit expansion more effectively even in such a “free banking” scenario.</p>The Road Ahead<p>Now that we see the main economic reason for transitioning to Bitcoin, we can discuss how such a transition could take place. In fact, I would argue that this transition has already started. In just about a decade, Bitcoin has grown from being a mere idea on a mailing list to a global network serving millions of people, having cleared trillions of dollars worth of transactions. Many businesses have already started accepting it, people are hodling it, and we may even say that there is a new, alternative, financial system already developing around it. Despite the impression some people get from its short-term price volatility, the trend is clear, Bitcoin is going forward. It is not waiting for politicians to approve it (like gold or Libra do), or central bankers to adopt it, or for “economists” to embrace it — it is growing in spite of their current objections.</p><p>This present trend though is by no means inevitable. While it is unlikely that Bitcoin itself can be stopped, its adoption could very well be. In the end, Bitcoin is just a tool available for people, but it is the public which decides if they wish to pick it up and use it. Like with all other economic and political changes, the success of Bitcoin depends on public opinion. It is not enough that we have Bitcoin if people don’t see its benefits, or refuse to use it. Unfortunately, the most prevalent views of today, both in economics and politics, see Bitcoin as useless, harmful and even “evil”. The idea of money not controlled by the state is rejected by all popular doctrines of today, and the only view somewhat receptive to it, that of the Austrian school, has been on the losing side of public opinion for many decades.</p><p>However, it seems that together, by combining Austrian economics as a theoretical framework, with Bitcoin as the practical approach, we could have an incredible opportunity to sway public opinion. While the Austrian framework provides the theoretical explanations of the benefits of having sound, hard money, Bitcoin demonstrates them in reality. And while it is unclear what further consequences would result from adopting Bitcoin, the Austrian approach to economics can clarify that. The Austrian view is the only one which is able to provide an explanation for the success of Bitcoin, and even simply for its existence. In other words, Bitcoin exposes the public to the possibility of having a different kind of money, not controlled by the state, while the Austrian theory explains why such money can be so beneficial and desirable. Every day in which Bitcoin continues to operate is a slap in the face of the mainstream economists. It is a living proof that their theories might not be right after all. That the free market does not need the state to set and manage the money, and can produce a better monetary system by itself.</p>Conclusions<p>To briefly summarise, the unique properties of Bitcoin — being digital, peer to peer, unstoppable hard money, have the potential to make a real transformation in the economy, preventing the business cycle and allowing for sustainable economic growth.</p><p>For millennia, governments were entrusted to manage the money for their citizens, but history is flooded with examples where this power was abused.²⁰ While in the past, such abuses were shameful acts committed secretly by rulers against their citizens (like coin clipping), today — in the age of populism — the rulers are no longer ashamed of it, but to the contrary, they proudly announce those acts, backed by the “intelligentsia” providing excuses for how this is done “for the people” to “stimulate the economy”.</p><p>As Mise explained on the essence of sound money:</p><blockquote>“It is impossible to grasp the meaning of the idea of sound money if one does not realize that it was devised as an instrument for the protection of civil liberties against despotic inroads on the part of governments. Ideologically it belongs in the same class with political constitutions and bills of rights. The demand for constitutional guarantees and for bills of rights was a reaction against arbitrary rule and the non-observance of old customs by kings. The postulate of sound money was first brought up as a response to the princely practice of debasing the coinage. It was later carefully elaborated and perfected in the age which — through the experience of the American Continental Currency, the paper money of the French Revolution and the British Restriction period — had learned what a government can do to a nation’s currency system.” — Ludwig von Mises</blockquote><p>Money is the backbone of the market economy, it is what coordinates the action of everyone, which is why it must be neutral — resistant to manipulations and forced debasements. It is time that we take the thing out of the hands of the state, back into the hands of the people. It’s time to move to Bitcoin.</p><p>[1]: There are enumerable examples of such cases, just for example: Former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Yellen’s contradictory statements: 1, 2 Economist J.

  ♦The Growing Relevance of Decentralization to Law<p>In recent years, “decentralization” has become an important concept for purposes of the law. Consider:</p><ul><li>Regulators such as the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have recognized that the applicability of financial regulations to blockchain systems can depend on the degree of control people have over them, with certain regulations being inapplicable when a system is “sufficiently decentralized” or “non-custodial”.</li><li>U.S. politicians have even learned to discern among decentralized cryptocurrencies and centralized cryptocurrencies, and to view the centralized solutions with more skepticism, as evinced in the U.S. Congress’s recent hearings on Facebook’s Project Libra.</li><li>Courts have held that the decentralized, trust-reduced nature of blockchain systems can affect how property laws and tort claims are interpreted — for example, the information in blockchain systems can form a foundation for property rights in tokens such as Bitcoin, even though information is typically not treated as property in other contexts.</li></ul><p>Unfortunately, lawyers, regulators and politicians might not always fully understand or explain what they mean by “decentralized”, nor why they believe decentralization has legal significance. Worse still, there is not even a clear non-legal meaning of “decentralization”. Some argue that even fully read-/write-unpermissioned blockchains like Bitcoin are not decentralized, while others have argued that blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are truly decentralized but other systems (like enterprise blockchains) are not.</p><p>The purpose of this article is to remind people that understanding when a system is decentralized for legal purposes is a critical task, to explain in more detail what I think a reasonable legal test of “decentralization” will look like and to encourage other attorneys and technologists to work on this important issue.</p>Why Do We Need a Legal Test for Decentralization?<p>Much has already been written about why the law does apply or should apply differently to decentralized systems than centralized systems. Thus, I will not attempt an in-depth policy justification of that position here, but for the most part will simply assume it is true. For those who may doubt the premise, I would suggest reviewing some or all of the resources listed under the endnotes for this article.</p><p>Assuming the law applies differently to a “sufficiently decentralized” system than to a centralized system, it is imperative that lawyers, judges, regulators and others involved in the legal industry develop a common understanding of what “decentralization” means. Otherwise, they will not know how to apply the law. I believe that a test for when a system is decentralized will be the best way of creating a consistent understanding.</p>A Legal Philosophy Interlude — Principles vs. Standards vs. Rules<p>The task of explicitly building the concept of “decentralization” into law could be approached in various ways, each of which has pros and cons.</p><p>The pros and cons of formulating laws as principles, standards or rules have been discussed extensively in legal philosophy generally, as well as specifically in the context of securities law reform. Although the subject is nuanced, in general it may be said that:</p><ul><li>A principles-based approach is the most flexible and likely to yield consistently sound results, but is slow and provides little ex ante certainty to market participants.</li><li>A standards-based approach is slightly less flexible while still having many of the advantages of a principles-based approach, but provides more clarity and predictability — though still typically will require extensive and costly legal analysis (the “Howey test” being a great example).</li><li>A rule-based approach is the most clear and provides the most ex ante certainty with the lowest transaction costs, but therefore must also be the most conservative and probably yield many ‘false negatives’ — i.e., proscribing activity that would be considered legitimate under a more principles-based or standards-based approach.</li></ul><p>The best legal systems combine the strengths of all three approaches to the law. U.S. securities laws provide an excellent example of this tripartite strategy. For example:</p><ul><li>Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the ’33 Act) exempts from SEC registration requirements “transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering”;</li><li>standards and practices about the meaning of “public offering” developed over some decades, through court opinions, regulatory action and consensus of the legal profession; and</li><li>in 1982, the SEC implemented Regulation D as a bright-line, non-exclusive “safe harbor” defining some clear circumstances in which a securities offering would not be deemed a “public offering” — such as a sale only to accredited investors.</li></ul><p>It is important to note that, in this evolution from principles to standards to rules, the rules do not override the standards, and the standards do not override the principles. Instead, all three forms of law remain available to market participants, who may select among them depending on their needs and risk appetite. A market participant who is highly risk-averse or cannot afford (in time and/or money) the costs of a very bespoke approach will opt to take advantage of the bright-line safe harbor rule. A more sophisticated market participant can, if they so wish, retain advisors to help them structure an offering that is legally compliant when considered in light of the deeper principles and policy considerations embodied in the statute.</p><p>My contention is that it should also be the same way with determining the law around “decentralization.” First, we need a flexible, rich and nuanced jurisprudential standard for assessing when a system may be sufficiently decentralized. Then, Goodhart’s law notwithstanding, there should also be a clear, bright-line “safe harbor” encompassing a subset of systems for which it is particularly obvious that they are decentralized, and market participants who wish to do so should be able to follow the conservative path set out in that safe harbor without fear of legal reprisals. Of course, non-legal principles of blockchain governance will continue to play a role, and should inform how the legal standards and rules are applied; a great example is Donald McIntryre’s “10 Principles for Blockchain Governance”.</p><p>In this article I will attempt to propose both a more flexible standard and a bright-line safe harbor for assessing whether a blockchain system is decentralized as a matter of law.</p>A Taxonomy of Blockchain Power Forms<p>In order to determine whether a blockchain system is “decentralized,” we must first itemize the various potential forms of power over a blockchain system. Only if control over each of them is “decentralized” should the system as a whole be considered to be clearly and indisputably “decentralized” as a matter of law.</p><p>1. Validation Power</p><p>Validation power refers to the ability of persons participating in or relying on the network to read and validate its data. Aside from certain read-permissioned enterprise blockchain systems, the validation power of most blockchain systems is decentralized because the blockchain data is freely accessible to anyone through the peer-to-peer network and uses a cryptographic scheme that enables any person with the right software and understanding to independently verify the validity of state changes by running the data through cryptographic checks. Decentralization of validation power also requires that all relevant software code be publicly available for review and operation.</p><p>Since decentralization is not all-or-nothing, some blockchain systems may decentralize validation power better than others. A blockchain system with serious “state bloat” may require such a large amount of data to be downloaded and validated, or the state transition rules may be so computationally challenging, that only enterprise-grade computer systems are up to the task. The validation power of such a blockchain system is still decentralized, but not as decentralized as in a system that is more lightweight and can be affordably and quickly validated by consumer-grade equipment. Validation power on the system with heavier state should be considered to be less decentralized than on the system with lighter state, but may still be sufficiently decentralized for purposes of the law.</p><p>2. Consensus Power</p><p>Consensus power refers to the ability of persons to write data to the blockchain. To write data to the blockchain is typically a two-step process: (1) a properly formed proposal to add a block must be made; and (2) that proposal must be accepted by the other nodes on the network in accordance with the consensus protocol embodied in the software client(s) those nodes are running.</p><p>Because Step 2 (accepting blocks) is essentially automatic and passive, Step 1 (proposing valid blocks) is the primary vector for potential “attacks” on the system. Thus, most protocols permission the power to propose blocks:</p><ul><li>In open proof-of-work-based systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.x, block production is permissioned by the protocol’s requirement that valid block proposals be accompanied by a hash meeting certain criteria, which can only be generated by running real-time computations on expensive computer hardware. Yet, anyone who has such hardware can propose a block— they do not need to be accepted into the network based on identity.</li><li>Delegated-proof-of-stake blockchains such as EOS and Cosmos protect against sybil attacks by only allowing a finite number of identified block proposers who are elected to serve that role. Their permissioning is identity-based and election-based.</li><li>Direct proof-of-stake systems use a stake-weighted random block proposer and validator function, which allows them to have an indefinite number of potential block proposers whose incentives are secured by their stakes. Overall permissioning takes the form of having put up stake, and per-block permissioning takes the form of randomness.</li></ul><p>Since the power to propose blocks is, in one sense or another, permissioned, it is also scarce and therefore valuable. Therefore, the circumstantial prerequisites of block proposal power may be analogized to ownership of the “means of production” within traditional capitalist economies — a “means of block production,” as it were.</p><p>When a single person or group of affiliated persons controls a very large percentage of the means of block production, that person or group also controls the consensus power of the network for most practical purposes, because the blocks proposed by that person or group will outpace those proposed by a minority of block producers and will be accepted and added to the blockchain automatically by the other nodes on the network in accordance with the consensus rules. This gives rise to the notion that consensus attacks on a blockchain, such as the notorious “double spend,” are possible.</p><p>The possibility that some person or affiliated group of persons could dominate consensus power reveals that, at least in the short term, the integrity of all blockchain systems depends on an honest “majority” assumption. Depending on the architecture of the protocol, “majority” may mean different things — in some cases even control of less than 50% of the means of block production can effectively provide control over the blockchain system. For example, on the EOS protocol, an honest majority means 2/3rds of block producers are honest, so control of 34% of the block producers would be enough to credibly threaten a consensus attack.</p><p>For a blockchain system to be considered legally decentralized, the consensus power, and thus the means of block production, should be decentralized. For example, on EOS, 2/3rds of block producers should be not only honest in practice, but also unaffiliated such that the honesty of each must be and can be tested separately. If it turned out that 2/3rds of EOS block producers were all entities owned by the same parent corporation (or were otherwise closely affiliated — for example, operating under a joint venture agreement providing for shared governance and incentives), the consensus power on EOS would not be decentralized.</p><p>Decentralization of consensus power may be less important technically and economically than it is legally. It has been persuasively argued that consolidation of hashpower in proof-of-work systems is unlikely in itself to result in consensus attacks, because the block producers, although powerful, have strong incentives to preserve the value of their capital by maintaining the integrity and neutrality of the system. This could be considered a reason why decentralization of consensus power is not important in assessing when a system is sufficiently decentralized as a matter of law.</p><p>For purposes of the law, however, this pragmatic consideration has limited implications. Regulatory law is paranoid and proactive. Thus, it does not merely seek to punish bad behavior by the powerful after they have abused their power, but should impose disclosure and compliance obligations to prevent harm by those who are particularly well positioned to inflict it. For example, under SEC rules, directors and officers of public corporations are not only required to disclose their bad conduct, but are required to disclose their structural conflicts of interest and lawful self-interested transactions.</p><p>From a purely legal standpoint, regulations or heightened duties of disclosure and care should apply to affiliated miners or other types of block producers who dominate the consensus power of a network to the point where they could inflict significant damage if they wanted to, even if they have good incentives and in practice have not (so far) abused their power. Thus, consensus power should always be considered in assessing decentralization.</p><p>However, in systems with otherwise good cryptoeconomic incentives (such as the non-repurposable sunk capital costs assumed by PoW ASIC miners), concentration of consensus power may be the least worrisome form of concentration of power. Thus, it may be that there can be significant concentration of consensus power, but the system as a whole may still be decentralized if there is competition for the means of block production and the persons who own the means of block production do not also possess a significant amount of other forms of power over the system.</p><p>3. Protocol/Client Power</p><p>Protocol power refers to the ability of persons to define or influence the blockchain system’s protocol.The protocol is comprised of various rules and procedures, including rules and procedures for determining which version of the blockchain is considered canonical, the circumstances under which new tokens can be minted, the validity and ordering of transactions, the range of allowable scripting logic and other matters defining how the blockchain system should operate.</p><p>Client power refers to the ability of persons to change the code of the software clients run by nodes on the network. Client power is closely related to protocol power, because the protocol must be expressed and implemented in the code of the software clients. People who wish to transact on the network must either download and run these clients or (via APIs) route transactions through others who have done so.</p><p>Protocol power and client power are theoretically separate. In Bitcoin, BIP 0014 introduced a distinction between the Bitcoin protocol and the dominant Bitcoin client, Bitcoin Core — a distinction that is expressed by creating a separate versioning scheme for the protocol. In practice, however, protocol power and client power tend to blur. For example, the Bitcoin Wiki’s entry on protocol documentation states that “[t]he Bitcoin protocol is specified by the behavior of the reference client,” and the reference client is defined as Bitcoin Core.</p><p>Although nodes on Bitcoin and Ethereum are in fact using a variety of clients, each network has a clear dominant client — Bitcoin Core in the case of Bitcoin and Go-Ethereum (Geth) in the case of Ethereum. Developers for these “core” clients have the most funding and influence. Maintainers of the minority clients tend to make conforming changes from the core client without significant political debate. I am unaware of any past situation in which the maintainers of the minority clients, for political or philosophical reasons, affirmatively refused to adopt a protocol change that was implemented by the maintainers of the dominant client. Accordingly, for purposes of testing decentralization, I will discuss protocol/client power as a single form of power.</p><p>Protocol/client power tends to be permissioned. For example, only a few individuals have “merge authority” over the official code repositories for Bitcoin Core and Geth. These persons are typically referred to as “core ‘developers,” and I will adopt this terminology going forward. Most of the time, core developers are not expressly acting agents or fiduciaries of any other person in pursuing their core development work, meaning that they can make changes to the client at their discretion. On the other hand, those individuals may also be funded by other sources of potential centralization — for example, by a “Foundation” which controls all or most of the capital generally available for funding development. These funding relationships may create agency-like pressures on core developers even if there is no formal or legal agency relationship.</p><p>Because protocol/client power is held by core developers, such power may superficially appear very centralized. However, there are at least two very important checks and balances on such power: (1) the clients for most blockchains (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) are open-source software; and (2) with certain exceptions (such as Tezos), the core developers do not have the power to push a client update to the nodes running the client on the network or otherwise compel persons running nodes to adopt a client update.</p><p>The combination of these two factors means that the broader community of people running nodes on the network — including miners, cryptocurrency exchanges, hobbyists, dApp providers and others, who for simplicity I refer to collectively as “users”—also have power. The users must (again, with certain exceptions, such as Tezos) voluntarily and affirmatively accept any new version of the client, and (in theory) have a viable alternative to doing so: They can continue to run the prior version of the open-source client, or can modify the new version of the open-source client to remove any changes that are objectionable and run that modified version. I refer to this countervailing power as “user power,” which is analyzed in a separate section below.</p><p>The nuances involved in measuring protocol/client power do not end at pointing out the balance between core developer power and user power. Even without taking user power into account, client/protocol power may be more decentralized if the core developers receive funding from various unaffiliated sources (rather than a single Foundation) and the commit process involves a complicated multisig scheme where keys are held by unaffiliated individuals.</p><p>The existence of multiple clients, while it has not to date been a significant catalyst of protocol politics, may operate as a subtle constraint on the discretion of the core developers, since if the maintainers of another client that has substantial popularity dissent, there is a risk of a contentious protocol fork and thus also a contentious network/chain fork.</p><p>Fear of potential legal liability for causing users to lose funds, though it has yet to be tested by the courts, likely operates as a similar subtle constraint, which core developers have sometimes expressed being conscious of. Core developers will also tend to care about their reputations, which would be harmed by bad conduct or mistakes.</p><p>Just as protocol/client power can be less centralized than it superficially appears, user power may not be as effective of a counterbalancing force in practice as it is in theory. The damage users can suffer from a contentious protocol/network fork mean that those who would like to dissent from a protocol/client upgrade must weigh the value of their dissent against its cost. If the name of the system and/or ticker symbol for the cryptocurrency are trademarked and that trademark is owned by, say, a Foundation, that Foundation has very potent protocol/client power, because it gets to decide legally which version of the protocol/client can use the trademark.</p><p>Accordingly, only protocol/client upgrades which are either extremely objectionable to a minority-in-power of users, or are (weakly or strongly) opposed by a majority-in-power of users, will fail to be adopted. Moreover, core developers are free to bundle protocol/client changes together so that users who object to one aspect of the changes will still accept the new version because they agree with other aspects. Finally, many users may be uninformed or apathetic — the classic ‘free rider’ problem — yet, unlike passive stockholders in a corporation, do not have ‘representatives’ advocating for their interest in a fiduciary relationship. These types of factors subtly constrain user power and make user adoption of a client upgrade, by itself, an inadequate measure of protocol/client consensus and legitimacy. Thus, in systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, core developers’ power is checked by user power only in extreme cases, which is not as good for decentralization as if user power were a potent check on core developer power across the full spectrum of potential protocol/client changes.</p><p>Arguably, separation of concerns — separating the governance mechanism from the upgrade mechanism — could deliver better decentralization of protocol/client power. As noted above, Tezos is dissimilar to Bitcoin and Ethereum inasmuch as it allows protocol/client updates to be ‘pushed’ to users, which in itself would seem to be an indicator of centralization. This might make Tezos look more centralized, but Tezos has other checks on protocol/client power — including a less clear division between core and non-core developers and a token-voting mechanism for approving client upgrades. However, the Tezos approach has other disadvantages and has sometimes been described as plutocratic, because it shrinks the class of “users” (as I have defined it) to token holders only, and thus risks sacrificing the possibility of richer political debates accompanying a proposed protocol/client change. For more on this issue, see under “User Power” below.</p><p>4. Economic Power</p><p>Economic power refers to the ability of persons to affect token price through the funding of research and development or token trading activity.</p><p>Although economic power may sound complex and difficult to measure, in practice I believe the main sources of economic power are ownership/control of a sizable percentage of the blockchain system’s native token and ownership/control of capital that was raised and set aside for research, development and/or marketing purposes by selling the token in an ICO, IEO or other similar investment scheme.</p><p>An example of a blockchain system with highly concentrated economic power would be MakerDAO, because the Maker Foundation has sold MKR tokens to investors, controls the capital from such sales, controls a substantial percentage of MKR tokens and through such MKR tokens controls parameters of the system that can auction new MKR tokens at any price. An example of a system with somewhat more decentralized economic power would be ZCash, where the development fund is co-governed by a non-profit Foundation and a for-profit technology company, which are legally required to be unaffiliated under the terms of their agreements, and the spending of the fund is managed by a board which is additionally required to have representation that is independent from both the Foundation and the technology company. (Incidentally, the ZCash trademark and logo are also jointly owned by the Foundation and technology company.)</p><p>Of all the forms of power over a blockchain system, economic power is the most potent, because it overlaps with the other forms of power. In proof-of-stake systems, economic power may overlap substantially with consensus power. If a person with substantial economic power over a proof-of-work system also has substantial consensus power through ownership of mining ASICs, that person may have much greater control over the system as a whole than would an ordinary dominant miner. Economic power representing control over capital earmarked for the system may also overlap with protocol/client power, since ordinarily he who controls the purse strings for funding the protocol and client also controls the protocol and client themselves. In systems with on-chain governance, economic power may also overlap substantially with both user power and (more directly than through funding mechanisms) protocol/client power.</p><p>Accordingly, in any legal test for determining decentralization, economic power should be assessed the most stringently of any of the forms of power over a blockchain system. Thus, while a relatively high concentration of consensus power may be tolerable in a system like Bitcoin while still asserting that Bitcoin is legally decentralized, a similarly high concentration of economic power should not be as tolerable.</p><p>5. User Power</p><p>User power refers to the ability of persons who do not have a significant amount of consensus power, protocol/client power or economic power to influence or resist those who do have a significant amount of such power. If user power is very strong, then even if the other forms of power are somewhat more concentrated than one might hope, the system may still be decentralized.</p><p>In systems without formal governance, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, “user” can have a very broad meaning, and includes, for example, token investors, token holders, companies running dAPPs, hobbyist node operators, small-scale miners, non-core protocol/client developers, other developers or professionals who make their living advising about the system or businesses or governments that use the system as part of their infrastructure.User power primarily takes two forms: (1) moral/reputational rewards and punishments effected through social signalling; and (2) adversarial forking. There are other forms of user power— such as the power of token holders to sell tokens and thus adversely affect price or the power of dApp devs to migrate their users to another blockchain system — but there are also significant costs to such types user power, and, more importantly, not all types of users share those types of user power in common.</p><p>Even the relatively brief histories of Bitcoin and Ethereum provide some excellent examples of how powerful users can be. In Bitcoin, the threat of a user-activated hardfork, made credible through a joint exercise of user power and protocol/client power over Bitcoin, was instrumental in activating SegWit on terms different from those struck under the so-called “New York Agreement” by a small group of persons having substantial consensus power and economic power over Bitcoin. This has rightfully been touted as a watershed moment revealing the power of users (see here, here and here). The arguable success and persistence of various adversarial forks from Bitcoin (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, et. al.) is likewise a testament to user power in another form — since users who dissented from the triumph of “small-blockers” could fork away and start a system intended to cater more to the payments use case. On the Ethereum side, the persistence of the original Ethereum blockchain as “Ethereum Classic” after TheDAO hardfork shows that user protest to chain reorganizations decided by those with significant protocol/client power can be effective.</p><p>In systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum, user power depends on the ability of a wide group of unaffiliated community participants to coordinate with one another. In general, it will require that the protocol/client is fully open source and that core devs do not have the ability to push updates to the client, so that adoption of client changes is voluntary and the threat of an adversarial fork is credible. Ideally, to make the threat of a fork effective, ownership of the brand and ticker symbol for the blockchain should be ‘up for grab’ by users, but other forms of decentralized brand ownership (such as the co-ownership arrangement by two independent organizations observed in ZCash) may also be effective. Other factors, like full nodes being easy to run, and a wide variety of unaffiliated, well-funded businesses being included in the user base, can be very helpful in bolstering decentralization through user power.</p><p>However, there are also constraints on user power in systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum — see above under “Protocol/Client Power” for a discussion of some of them. Arguably, Ethereum may have much less user power today than it did at the time of the ETC hardfork, because the dApps built on Ethereum are interdependent. Accordingly, in all but the most egregiously offensive exercises of protocol/client power, major dApp developers, who otherwise could operate as a source of independent user power, will tend to value staying on the same fork as one another more highly than asserting their individual political views.</p><p>In systems with formal on-chain governance, user power can assume additional forms, but they tend to belong to only to one category of user: the token holder. In delegated proof-of-stake systems, token holders have voting rights and the analysis of user power can become very complicated.</p><p>For example, if token holders can appoint block producers through their user power, consensus power is less centralized because it is constrained by token holders much more directly than Bitcoin users can constrain Bitcoin miners. However, if in such a system economic power is also very concentrated, then most users may actually have less power over consensus than they would in a system like Bitcoin, because a voting-minority is much more ineffectual in a system of formal governance than a vocal moral-minority can be in a system of multi-polar governance. If economic power happens to be concentrated in the hands of those holding substantial consensus power, the formalism of the system can lead to endless rent-seeking under the guise of formalist legitimacy. Similar pros and cons apply to on-chain governance of protocol/client development.</p><p>Although the analysis of user power is very complicated, in general it may be said that the broader and more diverse the base of “users” and the more power they have, the more likely a system is to be decentralized under the law.</p>A Flexible Test for Decentralization<p>A flexible test for decentralization would consider all the forms of blockchain power referred to above as factors, would assess each factor in light of the detailed facts and circumstances of a particular blockchain system, and would decide whether the system is sufficiently decentralized for legal purposes based on a kind of fuzzy logic about the extent to which each form of power is decentralized and how each form of power relates to the others in each specific case. This is, in effect, a form of lawyerly voodoo, but such tests — the Howey test being an example that is particularly notorious in the blockchain community — are common in the law, and can yield very good results and a degree of predictability as good judges consider cases and build up a body of precedent.</p><p>Here is my first stab at a flexible, rich legal test for determining whether a blockchain system is legally decentralized:</p><blockquote>General Statement of Test. An open network system is sufficiently decentralized if that system is an open network system and control over that system is widely distributed among independent persons.</blockquote><blockquote>Open Network System. An open network system is a peer-to-peer network of free open-source software clients which send, receive, validate and record data states on a distributed ledger in accordance with a protocol that is enforceable and verifiable by operation of the software clients.</blockquote><blockquote>Detailed Statement of Test. In general, sufficient decentralization will be found if, in light of all facts and circumstances, either:</blockquote><blockquote>(1) no single person or group of affiliated persons controls the open network system or the consensus, economics or software protocol/client of the open network system; or</blockquote><blockquote>(2) if any person or group does control one or more aspects of the open network system, control over other aspects of the system is widely distributed among independent persons in a manner that substantially limits the controlling person’s or group’s ability to interfere with or alter the open network system or other persons’ use and enjoyment of the open network system.</blockquote><blockquote>Rebuttable Presumptions to be Used in Applying the Test</blockquote><blockquote>(1) There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons owning or controlling more than 20% of the native tokens of an open network system, or who own or control token-sale proceeds the fair value of which exceeds 20% of the market capitalization of such token, has or have control over the economics of the open network system.</blockquote><blockquote>(2) There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons owning or controlling enough of the means of block production to violate the ‘honest majority’ assumption applicable to the open network system has or have control over the consensus of the open network system.</blockquote><blockquote>(3) There is a rebuttable presumption that a person or group of affiliated persons controlling a software client used by more than 50% of the nodes on the network has or have control over the protocol/client of the open network system</blockquote><p>This will typically be a difficult test to meet. And it should be a difficult test to meet. The purpose of finding that a blockchain system is sufficiently decentralized as a matter of law is to declare that since no person controls the system, no person is legally responsible for it and it is not subject to regulations, such as securities laws, that would ordinarily apply in similar circumstances. For this, the blockchain system must essentially be an un-owned, public commons. To qualify as such, it should truly exist for the benefit of and under the control of the public, rather than predominantly serving the interests of any specific person or group. Since power is subtle and omnipresent, a test of power must be rich, probing and comprehensive. One could analogize the difficulty of passing such a test to the difficulty of passing a “strict scrutiny” test under constitutional law.</p><p>However, the test is also very flexible and allows for balanced, fact-specific reasoning. Thus, under this test, a judge would be free to consider very nuanced check/balance dynamics such as those I raised in the previous section. For example, a judge would be free to declare that Bitcoin is legally decentralized even if there are facts in evidence showing that ASIC ownership is highly concentrated. After all, the judge could be persuaded that the power of any substantial ASIC owner would be checked by users through the threat of an adversarial fork or massive sale of BTC.</p>A Bright-Line “Safe Harbor” for Decentralization<p>Although a broad, conceptual test like the one set forth in the prior section will be the most flexible, accurate and complete method of determining whether a system is legally decentralized, I believe it would be insufficient by itself. Participants in blockchain systems should have more ex ante certainty about how the law applies to them than can be afforded by a complex, “fuzzy logic”, multi-factorial test. Accordingly, it would be highly desirable to propose a bright-line “safe harbor” identifying a subset of systems that are clearly decentralized based on simple facts (or so likely to be decentralized based on those facts that it is not worth regulators’ or judge’s time to undertake a closer inquiry).</p><p>Like other safe harbors (for example, the SEC’s “Regulation D”), reliance on such a safe harbor should be non-exclusive — i.e., anyone who wishes to adopt less conservative assumptions should still be free to prove decentralization through the broader, looser, conceptual test set forth in the prior section. It may also be necessary to define different safe harbors in different contexts — for example, a different safe harbor for considering decentralization under the Bank Secrecy Act than the Securities Act of 1933.</p><p>Here is a simplified version of the safe harbor I have proposed in the context of the securities laws. The full version of my proposal can be found here, and my open letter to the SEC explaining the rationale behind the proposal was published here.</p>♦Conclusion<p>I have done my best to efficiently set forth a reasonable starting point for legally testing when a blockchain system is sufficiently decentralized. However, it is only that — a starting point. A great deal more work is needed by a great many people to gain confidence in testing the existence and effects of decentralization for legal purposes.</p><p>Both the flexible test and the safe harbor set forth above in this article are available here. I have no illusions that I have developed a perfect test, and thus would highly encourage anyone interested in this issue — including but not limited to lawyers and coders — to ‘fork my legal code,’ as it were, and suggest alternatives and improvements. Only through such a collective effort will we will arrive at a satisfactory understanding of decentralized blockchain systems under the law.</p>ENDNOTES<p>I suggest reading these sources to better understand how decentralization affects the application of law to blockchain systems:</p><p>William Hinman: “Digital Asset Transactions: When Howey Met Gary (Plastic)”</p><p>Hester M.

The fact is that Bitcoin operates using the most transparent, verifiable, and traceable accounting ledger that has ever existed. It is true that identity verification is not always required to create a wallet and send or receive transactions so in this regard there is a level of masking that is provided, however, blockchain forensics is a new and emerging capability that could help to track and trace any funds being used for illegal purposes. Danish police made the news in 2017 when they traced criminals through their Bitcoin transaction activity. It is worth remembering that the current banking system is still the most effective means of laundering money in the world with an estimate of $3 Trillion being laundered through the US system annually, so it seems somewhat hypocritical for lawmakers, media and financial services firms to lay the ‘Bitcoin is used by criminals and terrorists’ argument at the door when the current system is guilty of much worse.</p>♦Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash<p>There are other cryptocurrencies such as ZCash, Monero, and the newly developed MimbleWimble protocol that underpins Grin and Beam, which use privacy features to obscure the sender and the recipient. There is certainly a theoretical case to be made that these protocols would be more effective at money laundering, however again, transaction volume analysis suggests that any illegal activity funding taking place over these networks is incredibly small if at all present compared to the volumes being transacted through USD.</p><p>At a more philosophical level, here we can also return to whether censoring money is an attractive trait. Ultimately, in a free society, an individual ought to have the ability to transfer value for whatever means and ends they desire and any attempt to monitor, trace or prohibit this can be viewed as censorship…any society where a nation state tries to impose censorship and de-platforming upon its citizens is a society where the citizens desperately need the means to transfer value as required, unencumbered.</p>Bitcoin mining wastes energy♦Photo by American Public Power Association on Unsplash<p>This is a particularly sensitive topic and one which the recent trend of climate change activists are sure to latch onto. The truth is that yes, Bitcoin energy consumption is huge, roughly the same as the annual consumption of energy in Ireland or the Czech Republic. The equally huge counter to this that is an uncomfortable truth is that a large percentage of this energy consumption uses green/clean or renewable energy, estimated between 30–70% clean. The range is so high as data is very difficult to verify and as such, allows biased narratives to be deployed by the media.</p><p>Further to the country comparisons, it has been reported that the US military alone is the 58th largest consumer of energy in the world — where is the media outcry against this energy consumption?</p><p>Whilst that seems a lot, let’s consider some other data points:</p><ul><li>The USA Christmas lights consume more energy annually than some developing countries at around 6.63 billion kilowatt-hours whilst countries like El Salvador uses 5.35 billion kilowatt-hours per year</li><li>The streaming of X-Rated videos from the internet globally is believed to consume as much energy as countries such as Belgium, Bangladesh, and Nigeria contributing c4% of greenhouse gas emissions globally and could rise to 8% of global emissions by 2025</li></ul><p>The above are simple examples but the oft used phrase is “we could use that energy for something else.” The challenge here becomes a question of libertarian ideology as there is no royal “we” to centralise and co-ordinate energy consumption globally, ultimately if a user pays for the energy they consume and the market is willing to produce and supply it then what that energy is used for is entirely up to the discretion of the consumer.</p><p>The incentives of the Bitcoin network align so well that they promote efficient deployment of capital and operational resources by Bitcoin miners. In other words, Bitcoin miners locate their operations in parts of the world that offer the most cost-effective access to energy and to this date there is no market whereby energy consumers pay more/less for the end, usage of their electricity and until a market develops, which ensures that Bitcoin miners need to pay a higher rate for electricity then they will continue to consume at the market rate. Typically, this is either through use of green or renewable energy sources, which explains why Iceland, with its abundance of geothermal energy, is a key global Bitcoin mining centre.</p><p>It is often the case that unused electricity is deployed for use by Bitcoin mining entities, by ‘unused’ we refer to electricity that is generated by a power station, typically through hydroelectric power but an excess capacity is created over and above the required demand so the electricity is lost as it transmits throughout the network, eventually going unused. In this instance, mining companies set up their operations in remote locations in countries such as China and strike deals for excess energy directly with the energy provider themselves. So whilst a popular argument is — “but the human race could use that energy to much better effects” in many cases, much of it is already going to waste, and it cannot be transmitted for use over vast distances anyway. In a somewhat philosophical view, one could counter-argue that such ‘lost’ electricity is actually turned into a commodity money (Bitcoin) and sent globally over the internet making its utility, production, and shipping costs infinitely superior to other global commodities.</p><p>In an example of well-aligned incentives a Canadian mining company ‘Upstream Data’ recently developed a product that allows oil drillers to attach a Bitcoin mining rig to their methane gas flares in oil and gas fields to convert the excess energy burned off to power a mining rig and re-use some of the energy by-products of drilling that would have otherwise been lost — incentive alignment works.</p><blockquote>As Saifedean Ammous, author of the Bitcoin Standard writes in his research blog:</blockquote><blockquote>“Everything in our lives is related to energy. Transportation, manufacturing, cooking etc. requires energy. Thus, efficient energy production is essential to our everyday lives. Bitcoin incentivizes efficient energy production and therefore sets the correct incentives for the energy system as a whole.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Bitcoin is a serious alternative to the current financial system. Bitcoin has the features to be a qualified, stateless, world currency since it is censorship-resistant, permissionless, and trustless and since it provides instant settlement. The network is open and censorship-resistant through proof of work. Essentially, Bitcoin is a common good from the people for the people.</blockquote><blockquote>The correct incentivization inherent in the Bitcoin protocol and the importance of Bitcoin as an alternative to the financial system justify the massive use of energy for mining.”</blockquote>Bitcoin can’t be used to buy coffee (micro-purchases)♦Photo by Clay Banks on Unsplash<p>Anyone using this argument is focussing on the wrong metrics and not comparing like for like and even worse, being dragged into the somewhat fanatical and disingenuous world of the white paper title outlining that Bitcoin was intended to be ‘peer to peer electronic cash.’ Over time, Bitcoin has developed and grown to becoming more akin to a form of digital gold, and to an extent, is a ‘heavy’ digital asset to use as it takes longer than others to confirm transactions on the network. So whilst this comment is partly true as it could take an hour or more to confirm the transaction, it is wrong to compare Bitcoin transaction speed and scalability to that of the Visa, PayPal or Venmo networks.</p><p>Essentially Bitcoin is a network for final settlement — it probably is not important to use the Bitcoin network to record your coffee transaction on the most immutable and transparent ledger…for ever.</p><blockquote>As Bitcoin and blockchain researcher and thought leader Nic Carter states, Bitcoin is best thought of as a large container ship transporting expensive goods over long distances rather than the local postman delivering letters and parcels over the final mile.</blockquote><p>When humans began to deploy fiat or paper money for use in an economy in place of a specie backed currency such as the gold standard, this can be referred to as a ‘Layer 2’ technology. Use of precious metals in direct exchange is layer 1, the addition of a 1:1 backed paper is the second layer making portability much easier. Layer 2 or 3 solutions on top of Bitcoin such as the Lightning network, may well deliver the scalability in Bitcoin that many are asking for so it can be used for micro-purchases. Even a bi-metallic standard equivalent digital asset protocol that is less energy intensive than Bitcoin and serves as a ‘Silver’ or a ‘Copper’ to Bitcoin’s gold could develop.</p><p>Ultimately there is a cost to write transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, in future, this may rise, and as such, these transactions may be pooled and netted off on a less frequent basis in a similar way that central banks settle balance of payments deficits today.</p><p>In summary, comparing Bitcoin to Visa, PayPal and Venmo is the wrong comparison to make at this point, but over time, Bitcoin may well have additional layers of technology to solve the scalability challenge, and this may also extend to the inclusion of some form of privacy.</p>Bitcoin isn’t backed by anything / has no intrinsic value♦Photo by Jacek Dylag on Unsplash<p>Since 1971 and the complete separation from the gold exchange standard, the US dollar has not had anything backing it. Fiat currency is an established medium of exchange, however, in some countries, it does not serve its purpose well as a store of value or a unit of account due to hyperinflationary challenges. However, if we set these to one side, the notion that fiat currency is backed by anything is a severely misguided notion. It is true that governments mandate the use of fiat currency and as such, they ‘back the use by Law.’ This does not give fiat currency any real value, however, and if the government and central bank mismanage the economy, they undermine the value of the currency and cause inflationary challenges as we saw in countries such as Argentina, Zimbabwe and many others throughout the 20th century.</p><p>Money is a collective belief system and anyone who wants to argue that fiat currency is ‘backed by fundamentals’ is essentially saying, they don’t really understand how money works, they trust central banks and governments because they haven’t researched or analysed any other potential system, their belief systems, frameworks, and mental models allow them to shortcut thinking and analysis of this nature by buying into the notion that ‘the gold standard failed’ and that we now live in a modern banking world. These arguments will ignore the failures of old that are creeping back into the system today and may very well lead to a Roman Empire style collapse of the global economy. We know for certain what the monetary policy and scarcity of the Bitcoin network will be for the next 120 years — we have no idea what any central bank or government may do to monetary and fiscal policy from one week to the next.</p><p>If anything, Bitcoin is ‘backed’ by the laws of mathematics and code and unlocking these laws costs time, resource (both human and capital), and energy. Whether Bitcoin has any value is determined by the market forces, and the Austrian economics school theories of Mises and Menger with their notions of subjective value theory and the regression theorem of money — ultimately we view Bitcoin as a Veblen good, and it has only ever served the purpose of value transfer.</p>Bitcoin could be hacked♦Photo by Clint Patterson on Unsplash<p>Hacking Bitcoin is next to impossible. It has been in existence for 10 years, and any kind of threat or attack that exists that could disrupt it has already been attempted. It is reported that eccentric millionaires have even paid teams of hackers $1m over the course of a year to hack the network, and they have not been able to yield any success.</p><p>When we discuss hacking Bitcoin, there are two obvious options:</p><ol><li>To hack the software itself</li><li>To undertake a 51% attack</li></ol><p>Hacking the software itself is next to impossible as a result of the verification and mining consensus rules any attempt to alter the software will be rejected by each miner running an up to date version of the software and similarly any attempt to process a fraudulent transaction will be detected by each node and rejected.</p><p>People often wonder what makes the Bitcoin blockchain secure, and it is often said that a key risk to Bitcoin is the fact that it is software and software could just be hacked, if not now, then in the future with a quantum computer. The reality is that the Bitcoin blockchain is secure as a result of the multiple different failsafe mechanisms that guard against attack, the energy, and computing power used to continue the longest chain of transaction records and the game theoretical nature of the outcome of such an attack.</p><p>To unpick this further, Bitcoin uses complex and advanced cryptographic techniques to guard against a 51% attack. That is the idea that if enough miners grouped together 51% of the total mining resources, then they could unpick the blocks one by one and change the history on the digital ledger to move transactions to other accounts that they hold the private keys for. Such an attack is virtually impossible as the size, cost, and complexity of the attack would require a large number of nation states to work together — a level of cooperation which has never happened in history aside for coalition forces during world war 1 and 2.</p><p>To firstly gain access to the necessary computing power and energy required to undo the confirmed transactions would be no mean feat and would effectively result in a split or a fork of the chain as the history and record would now be different from the original. The actors would then need to undertake the attack all the while being watched and monitored by the other 49% who would continue confirming blocks on the original chain. This means that for the attack on the original chain to be successful, the attackers would also need to amend all the new blocks confirmed every 10 minutes since the attack began — otherwise, the attacked chain of the network would have no value. So the attacker would then need to continue spending money on computing power and energy to catch up to the rest of the 49%, which would be a long drawn out process and would likely bankrupt the malicious attacker. It is estimated that a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network would cost an attacker almost $600,000 per hour.</p><p>So, in summary, the incentive to launch a 51% attack and change the ledger is just not present. Similarly, any actor attempting to exploit the code or vulnerabilities in the network will have their attack rejected as each node runs a copy of the Bitcoin client and as such, any attempt to make a change to the code will be rejected by the network as all the other nodes will be running a copy of a different software.</p><p>Another popular example the media likes to use is that Quantum computing would break the Bitcoin private key encryption — this is akin to saying that you don’t need to worry about ageing because someone will invent time travel before you die. Quantum computing is at least 30 years away and the current claims regarding quantum computing are overstated. That said, the entire Bitcoin development community are already considering how to respond to quantum computing threats and how to embed quantum resistant cryptography into the core software so by the time a legitimate quantum threat exists it is highly likely that a legitimate quantum resistant defense will emerge and the entire Bitcoin code, network, and mining equipment will shift to adopting quantum resistant technologies.</p>Bitcoin is too volatile to be a store of value♦Photo by Claire Satera on Unsplash<p>We are only 10 years into its lifecycle, so speculation and large holders could manipulate price movements, however, it is important to remember the concept of how commodity money goes through various stages of development. Bitcoin has successfully transitioned from being a collectible to the early stages of a store of value. Once more liquidity comes into the Bitcoin network, then it will be harder for large holders to manipulate the price. At some point, these holders will sell and take their profits to spend on whatever they please. Those coins will then be available on the market for new entrants, and in turn, these individuals may well hold for a long time to watch their value increase and more liquidity comes into the system, again, at a certain point, these people will sell their holdings. The pattern will continue, and there will be severe price appreciations and declines, however, these will become less severe as liquidity increases — once this happens, the store of value stage will be complete, and Bitcoin can then progress to becoming a Medium of Exchange and a Unit of Account.</p><p>So at present, volatility attracting new market entrants all the time, however over the long term, the rollercoaster needs to settle into a more traditional, long term market cycle for institutional investors to feel comfortable allocating a significant portion of their assets into it.</p><p>For others around the world though, Bitcoin already operates as a store of value in countries where governments and money have failed. Countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Turkey have all seen appreciations in Bitcoin purchases, and despite price declines from c$20k to $3k, this has been a better place to store wealth than the local currency.</p>Bitcoin is not regulated and governments will just kill it♦Photo by Sebastian Pichler on Unsplash<p>Regulation doesn’t solve problems entirely. There is no government in the world that can actually regulate the Bitcoin network. Governments can take action around the edges of the network, but even officials within the US Government finally recognise that they cannot stop the Bitcoin network or Bitcoin transactions.</p><p>Governments are, however, able to regulate the edges of the network such as the fiat on/off ramps which are typically subject to ‘know your customer’ regulations and ID checks. Governments are also able to regulate activities such as Bitcoin ownership and Bitcoin mining if they wish. Some governments have banned Bitcoin mining as an activity, and others have gone as far as to outline that only the state is allowed to provide Bitcoin mining facilities.</p><p>What is clear is that as a protocol, Bitcoin cannot be shut down. Governments do not have the ability to stop it or come anywhere close to killing it. What regulators are looking at and in particular, US regulators is the introduction of investment-friendly vehicles. These will serve as fiat on/off ramps and will allow institutions access to Bitcoin. A key concern is the notion of custody, who will hold the private keys to access the funds on the Bitcoin network? There are proposals in place at present, and it won’t be long before a Bitcoin ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) exists so in some form or another, a regulatory framework will emerge for Bitcoin and the entire cryptoasset industry.</p>Bitcoin has no CEO♦Photo by Hunters Race on Unsplash<p>That is exactly the point. The decentralised nature means the network is upgraded by consensus and any miner that disagrees with the update can choose to ‘fork’ and continue a separate chain. Not having a CEO means there is no single person or entity that can choose the direction and design of the protocol without vigorous debate with the whole community first. A CEO can be called in to testify in government hearings or pursued for mismanagement of funds — without a CEO the Bitcoin network becomes an entity that is not subject to the normal laws of power, control, coercion, intimidation, manipulation, and corruption — this is one of its greatest assets.</p>Bitcoin is the first and first doesn’t always mean success<p>Bitcoin is the 5th iteration since 1990s of a digital money, and it is the first to fully succeed in generating a system that removes centralised 3rd parties and creates digital scarcity. Bitcoin draws upon other previous protocols such as eGold and Hashcash and implements it in a fully decentralised way.</p>Bitcoin is opensource so it could just be copied/forked and improved<p>The game theory involved in creating a fork of the Bitcoin code is such that any fork is unlikely to take a significant amount of value, network, or mining power away from the core BTC code. In 2017 a disagreement about transaction scaling ensued where one group wanted to maintain a low block size at around 1 Mb per block, and another group wanted to increase the block size which would, in turn, increase the throughput and speed of transactions. In principle, the idea seemed logical however an entire debate and discourse erupted around the broader risks and challenges that ‘big blocks’ present. One key issue is that the mining ecosystem would no longer be possible for single and small entities, rather it would start to require a more industrial size and scale — this would put control of mining operations more in the favour of large, server farms and corporations who could afford the CAPEX set up and open running costs of such a huge operation. To maintain decentralisation the original chain was maintained whilst a splinter group forked the Bitcoin blockchain and continued transactions using bigger blocks. This was called the Bitcoin Cash or BCash chain. Not long after, further divisions occurred within the BCash community and this chain then split into BCash ABC and BCash Satoshi’s Vision. Needless to say, all of these actions have been almost catastrophic for these chains as they now have next to no value being transferred over them and the mining rewards and incentives are not there as the value of the coins on these chains is very low — the low hashpower as a result also opens up these chains to a 51% attack. The hourly cost to launch a 51% attack on Bitcoin is estimated at $600,000, the equivalent for BCash is $7,500 per hour.</p><p>It is by studying the outcomes of chain forks that the beauty of the Bitcoin network, game theoretical reward mechanisms and the in built self-reinforcing incentive mechanisms that one can really appreciate the brilliance of the system.</p>Conclusion<p>If you have managed to stay focussed and read through to this section then you deserve a medal! But more importantly, you should now be able to see how and why the media gets the coverage so wrong. The cornerstone of so many articles is put in the wrong place and often intentionally so to present a biased view of ‘why Bitcoin is a failed experiment’ without informing readers or viewers that there is a different viewpoint. For many, Bitcoin is just too complex to understand and they are happy to accept the word of elected officials at the Treasury or Government regarding what money is and how they should interact with it. Typically, economists find it hard to reconcile that commodity money and Austrian economic principles may actually be a better option than the fiat, state-controlled, centrally managed monetary system that is in place globally which they are likely to have studied for 10+ years and committed a significant portion of their time and energy into contributing to. For these people, the truth that Bitcoin is the most effective form of money the world has ever seen is too painful to accept and as an American writer, Upton Sinclair once said,</p><blockquote>“it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on him not understanding it.”</blockquote><p>About us: Genesis Node is an executive training organisation focussing on helping businesses and individuals to understand Bitcoin, digital assets, blockchain, smart contract technology, how they fit into the world and how they might disrupt existing operating models.

  <p>TL:DR; ATO treats forks as creating a “new asset” causing unexpected tax burdens for any Australian taxpayer holding cryptocurrencies in future.</p>♦Background<p>I got a nasty surprise when preparing my 2017/2018 tax return. I had sold my Bitcoin Cash as fast as possible, and gotten around to selling other minor forks just before the close of the financial year. The ATO then decided that those sales were (1) assets under 12 months old, and (2) a cost-basis of 0. The result was that they wanted 48% of the amount in tax; over twice what I was expecting and had set aside!</p><p>In Australia, you (generally) pay Capital Gains Tax on the difference between the purchase (“base price”) and sale prices, but you only pay half of the amount if you held it for 12 months or more.</p>The ATO’s Reasoning<p>The ATO reasoned that a fork creates a new asset valued at zero and the new asset is the one whose rules have changed. I can see how they arrived at this, and am kicking myself for not getting involved earlier: having a real technical expert involved might have avoided the shallow understanding which lead to this.</p>A Split is Not a New Asset<p>The idea that a new asset is created is the base misunderstanding, and to see why, we need to go beyond simplifying nomenclature like “wallets holding bitcoins” and “tokens” and understand what’s actually happening.</p><p>Bitcoin is a network of independent nodes, each maintaining its own ledger attaching amounts to keys which can spend them. When I say “I own 1 bitcoin!” what I mean is that all up-to-date nodes on the network have a current entry in their ledger which indicates that 1 bitcoin can be spent using a secret key that I hold. Normally the bitcoin protocol ensure that over time, nodes will come to consensus the contents of their ledgers. This controlling an entry in this consensus of ledgers is what bitcoin actually is, and all bitcoin is: this is what people mean when they say “bitcoin is unbacked”.</p><blockquote>Consensus that I control an entry in the ledgers is the asset, because that’s what bitcoin actually is.</blockquote><p>Bitcoin has value because people respect these ledger entries as currency, and as long as the network is functioning normally I can use it to send an instruction to update the ledgers which will spread through the network and eventually be entered in all the ledgers (in particular, the one trusted by the “recipient”).</p><p>What did change with the Bitcoin Cash fork was nor normal though: One (larger) part wanted to update the ledger rules to allow a new appendix with each entry, the other wanted to update the ledger rules to simply expand the allowable number of entries. The network split into two irreconcilable parts which no longer talk.</p><p>My key didn’t change, or even gain any additional capabilities. The consensus of ledger entries I controlled split into two groups, but an asset split is not a taxable event. If I own gold and split it into different isotopes, that is not a taxable event, does not change its cost basis, and does not change its acquisition date.</p><p>Over time, the market decided that ledger entries of the smaller group (now called Bitcoin Cash) were worth less than those of the larger group (now simply called Bitcoin).</p><blockquote>When the ledgers split into two groups, the asset (lines in the ledgers) split. This is not a taxable event.</blockquote>The ATO’s Workaround I: Asset Valuation<p>Once they decided to treat it as a newly acquired asset, the ATO instantly had a new problem: how to value the new asset? If you gain an asset, you have to pay income tax on it! Yet clearly the user did nothing, and hitting them with a random tax bill seems unfair (especially if they couldn’t spend it before the price dropped precipitously). To work around this, they chose a value of 0.</p><p>The first taxation officer I spoke with declared that they chose a value of 0 as it was the most favorable to the taxpayer, the second insisted that the value of 0 was a “matter of fact”.</p><p>You could actually trade Bitcoin Cash before the fork (though you had to send your Bitcoin to an exchange to do so), and there were various other future markets available. I agree that the market was far too easily manipulated and shallow for this price to be a reliable signal, but it’s clearly not zero. Picking 0 is unlikely to draw immediate ire from taxpayers (though see below!), but it’s very hard to defend: as a tax payer I certainly can’t decide to value “hard to assess” assets at 0!</p>The ATO’s Workaround II: The Technical Test<p>When deciding which was the new asset, the ATO chose a technical test: the one one whose rules hadn’t changed was the original asset, and the one which had was a New Asset. This often gives the same results as you’d expect if you assumed a “market” test (i.e. biggest market-cap fork is the original, or the one with the original name is the original).</p><p>However, it reflects a lack of understanding of how cryptocurrencies work. For all the talk of “immutable ledger”, they change the rules with some regularity. I can think of five bitcoin rule changes, but there were more and we anticipate another one this year (2020).</p><p>In particular, while Bitcoin Cash was forked by changing a consensus rule (making it a New Asset according to the ATO), this was a mere technicality: two weeks later Bitcoin also changed, as they locked in the Segregated Witness soft fork. As this change was opposed by Bitcoin Cash proponents, it was necessary they fork first[1]. It could be argued that at the time Segregated Witness activated, the Bitcoin Cash protocol was more similar to the original rules than Bitcoin itself was!</p>Absurdities That Follow<p>If you assert 1+1 = 3, things tend to break down badly. The results here are the same: by asserting that a new asset is created, you create a bunch of new problems:</p><ol><li>If you held Ethereum across the Ethereum Classic Fork, Your Cost Basis is 0.<br>Ethereum became a New Asset on July 20th 2016. This was confirmed verbally by the current chair of cryptocurrencies at the ATO. This means that if you sold Ethereum since then you probably didn’t pay enough tax, and if you sold it before July 20th 2017, you’re not entitled to a capital gains discount. Surprise!</li><li>Bitcoin may have become a New Asset at the first halving.<br>Greg Maxwell once told me that a number of miners tried to continue to grant themselves 50BTC rewards after the first halving. Their fork quickly petered out, but it’s easy to argue that their fork was following the original rules, and thus Bitcoin is a New Asset. If true, and you held it across November 2012, your cost basis is now 0, and no capital gains discount is available if you sold before November 2013.</li><li>Bitcoin may become a New Asset on any Soft Fork.<br>Since any rule change can create a fork, you may find yourself holding a New Asset, with cost basis 0 and no CGT discount until 12 months after the fork (unless, of course, it forks again!), should some fool decide to do so. It’s unclear whether you need to be aware of the fork, or how serious it needs to be, but it would be an interesting business model to offer the ATO a contract to create such a fork to create a taxation windfall!</li><li>Bitcoin will become a New Asset on any Hard Fork.<br>Experience has shown that any Bitcoin hard fork will be controversial; if the original chain is continued (as expected), Bitcoin becomes a New Asset with cost base 0.</li></ol><p>In these last cases, you have no control over whether this happens, creating massive taxation risk.</p>What I’m Doing About It<p>Clearly, if we want people to actually hold or use cryptocurrencies in Australia, these rules are impractical. Given they’re wrong on a fundamental level, I’ve already spent thousands of dollars on a Private Ruling and objections. At the end of 2019 I engaged a law firm for further research; their professional advice was that it was going to be expensive, and difficult.</p><p>Reluctantly, I have folded on this. It seems the only hope for reasonable outcomes in future in Australia would be legislative change.</p><p>[1] Technically, they had to change to implement replay protection, otherwise in theory they could have waited for the soft fork and then mine an invalid segwit tx to fork off afterwards. That would have been an impractical method, however.</p>♦

  <p>By Ross Ulbricht</p><p>On December 10, 2019, I wrote the following (see here):</p><blockquote>“A drop below the beginning of wave 2 (around $4,200) would invalidate the impulsive count of wave (5) because wave 4 cannot overlap wave 2 ...This would indicate a much greater likelihood that our second scenario is playing out.”</blockquote><p>Since then, the price of bitcoins has dropped down to ~$4,000, fulfilling the above requirement. With the bullish count invalidated, the picture is becoming clearer. The cycle-degree bull market — from Bitcoin’s beginning to the ~$20,000 peak of late 2017 — is over. We are now in the last wave (wave ⓒ) of Bitcoin’s first cycle-degree bear market (the largest yet). Figure 1 shows the five primary-degree waves up (①, ②, ③, ④, ⑤) in wave I along with the three primary-degree waves down (Ⓐ, Ⓑ, Ⓒ) in wave II, with the end of wave II estimated.</p>♦Fig. 1<p>Estimating the extent and duration of wave II is difficult and imprecise. There is no limit to how low it can go (except $0) because wave I started at $0. And there is no hard limit to how long it could take. However, corrections will often end in the price range of the previous fourth wave of one less degree. That was wave ④ from back in 2014. Its price range was $175–$1,240. The two previous bear markets (of primary degree) reduced prices by 86% and 94%. An equivalent reduction by wave II would take prices to $2,800 or $1,200. Wave Ⓐ of II reduced prices by 84%. An equivalent reduction by wave Ⓒ of II would take prices to $2,200.</p><p>In terms of duration, if wave Ⓒ lasts as long as wave Ⓐ, it will end around June or July 2020. However, waves (C) of ② and (C) of ④ (not labeled in Figure 1) were considerably larger than their respective (a) waves. If wave Ⓒ of II conforms to this pattern , it could drag on into 2021.</p>♦Fig. 2<p>Figure 2 shows a closer view of wave II to date. Wave Ⓐ brought prices down to $3,200, and wave Ⓑ brought them back up to nearly $14,000. Wave Ⓒ should bring them to new lows below $3,200, completing wave II. I have tentatively labeled the move from the end of wave Ⓑ to the low near $7,000 as wave (A) and the counter-trend rise above $10,000 as wave (B). The low near $6,400 is not the end of wave (A), but is rather wave (b) of (B) in a pattern called a “running flat.” So now, we are in the final wave (C) of Ⓒ of II. A break below the major low of $3,200 will be a solid confirmation of this, at which point we will be trying to determine when the final low is in. This will be a major buying opportunity. If the price rises above the peak near $14,000, we will have to reevaluate our interpretation, but at this point that seems like a very unlikely scenario.</p><p>As noted before, the end of wave II will be accompanied by extreme pessimism and possibly antagonism toward Bitcoin on par with the extreme optimism that accompanied the end of wave I. It will take fortitude to buy in such an environment, but the rewards as wave III takes prices to new highs will be well worth it.</p>♦

  <p> Some years ago, anthropologist and Wall St Occupant David Graeber wrote a history of Debt in which he debunks the “myth” of barter. In his telling, barter never exists in human history – Any transfer of property is the result of an exploitative power relationship, therefore ownership is theft, debt is slavery, and socialism is the answer.</p>
<p>In short, Graeber was questioning Adam Smith’s thesis that the division of labor leads to the voluntary exchange of surplus goods, which leads to the emergence of money. Chartalism vs Metallism.</p>
<p>George Selgin debunks Graeber’s “debunking” by pointing out that barter is an unstable system, and any population that engages in barter will quickly progress to monetary exchange or perish from unmatched needs. Anthropologists rarely encounter barter societies in the wild because it’s a temporary state.</p>
<p>Here we are in the time of coronavirus, where preppers and hoarders have emptied store shelves and I’m forced to violate social distancing to trade toilet paper for distilled water from a neighbor. Barter is back. Will TP become the new store of value, or shall we starve?</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>In California, anti-gouging laws prevent retailers from raising the price of goods to meet heightened demand. Six months ago, Clorox disinfecting wipes averaged $3 a can. Today, it’s illegal to charge more than $3.30 even though I would gladly pay twice that. </p>
<p>This isn’t barter; it’s demonetization. Dollars no longer serve as an accurate unit of account for Clorox wipes, especially since no amount of dollars can buy wipes that are out of stock. This is the point where essential items should gain intermediate commodity status and evolve into money.</p>
<p>♦</p>
<p>Except that can’t happen. The FBI has a Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force that prevents enterprising citizens from providing much-needed liquidity on scarce products. It&#8217;s illegal to even source them from elsewhere. My mother tried to buy a box of Chinese KN95 respirator masks for my brother’s hospital, but the masks were seized by customs at the border. </p>
<p>Even in the brief historical periods where barter may have existed, it was never really barter so much as bilateral monopoly. Do you think tribal chiefs allowed members to freely negotiate with hostile tribes? Of course not – some of the earliest traded goods were women and children. </p>
<p>So Graeber was wrong. Power isn’t the ability to assert ownership over property. Power is the ability to control how others assert ownership over property.</p>
