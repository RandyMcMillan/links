  <p>The madness of this world became obvious in an instant. Everything is
changing way faster than most of us ever imagined — but I’m not
worried. To the contrary, I’m weirdly optimistic — because of Bitcoin,
and because of you.</p>

<p>You probably don’t know me; I probably don’t know you. And that’s
perfectly fine. However, I know some of you — and I believe that I
know some of you quite well, even if we have never met or met only
briefly. I have read your writings, watched you debate each other, saw
the things you’ve built, and listened to your voices for countless
hours. I don’t care if you identify as a bitcoiner, or as a maximalist,
or as a pre-/shit-/multi-/whatever-coiner. I don’t care if you fell down
the rabbit hole years ago or if you just got the first glimpse of the
honey badger den. I don’t care about your political beliefs, sexual
orientation, gender, religion, age, and countless other qualifiers that
might be used to put you in a box. The fact that you are here, reading
this, thinking about Bitcoin, caring about Bitcoin, is enough for me.
That’s why I’m bullish. Bullish on Bitcoin, and bullish on bitcoiners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Bullish on bitcoiners.”</p>

  <p><cite>Matt Odell</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin’s implications are so far-reaching, the innovation so profound,
it boggles the mind. The inter-disciplinary nature of this beast
attracts minds from countless areas of expertise: computer science,
cryptography, mathematics, physics, economics, finance, trading,
engineering, the list goes on and on. Bright minds, extraordinary
characters, strong opinions, contrarians, idealists trying to change the
world — all those and more make up the loose collective we might call
bitcoiners.</p>

Honey Badger Don’t Care

<p>Don’t get me wrong: Bitcoin doesn’t need you; it doesn’t need any of us.
It’s incentive systems have a way to make sure that Bitcoin will be
fine, even if the set of people working on it and using it changes
completely. It will be fine, just as it is now as the whole world grinds
to a halt.</p>

<p>The current crisis — and the financial repercussions that will
inevitably follow — will make it obvious that we need Bitcoin more
than Bitcoin needs us. Again, don’t get me wrong: we must not be
complacent. We must continue to care, continue to build, continue to
educate, continue to proselytize, continue to argue, continue to debate.
We find ourselves at the forefront of a battle of ideas, and in this
battle, complacency kills.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ask not what bitcoin can do for you, but what you can do for
 bitcoin.”</p>

  <p><cite>Adam Back</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you can contribute by coding, writing, educating, discussing,
recording, creating, or simply hodling — great. But make no mistake:
Bitcoin is bigger than all of us. And, dare I say it, the current
failure of the legacy system is bigger than Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Yes, Bitcoin has the potential to fix many of the underlying issues of
our corruptible and broken systems. But we will need a plethora of
freedom-enabling technologies to win this war; tools that empower the
individual by default, by offering strong privacy guarantees,
encryption, and the freedom to use these tools without restrictions.</p>

Shill Lightly

<p>As this global pandemic sweeps through the globe, with hundreds of
thousands infected, tens of thousands dead, and millions of people out
of a job, priorities shift from trivial to existential. While difficult,
it is more important than ever to stay humble and shill lightly. It is
all too easy to alienate friends and family by offering an enthusiastic
Bitcoin lecture every time you sit at the dinner table. While enthusiasm
is laudable, I strongly believe that Bitcoin will be understood by
everyone as soon as they are ready — be it out of necessity or out of
curiosity. Yes, the timeline just got accelerated. But this is still a
marathon, not a sprint. And it might be one of many marathons.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the facts of history is that battles do not stay won. Those
 that matter have to be waged again and again.”</p>

  <p><cite>Stanley Knowles</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The powers that be will neither step away willingly nor silently. And
since the battle for self-sovereignty and freedom is one that matters,
it will have to be waged again and again.</p>

Protecting An Idea Whose Time Has Come

<p>Bad actors will continually try to undermine Bitcoin, as they have tried
in the past. Unfortunately, we have good reason to believe that this
will continue. And, unfortunately, we see the trend of undermining and
maiming technology everywhere we look. If we look at the internet, for
example, we see various interest groups waging war against net
neutrality, politicians introducing nation-wide firewalls, websites
geo-blocking content, people getting arbitrarily deplatformed,
demonetized, or banned.</p>

<p>They say that nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. I
believe that Bitcoin’s time has come, and in hindsight, it will be
obvious to everyone. Before it becomes obvious, however, swathes of
people will try to distort what Bitcoin is and the ideas it represents.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ideas change the world, but they do it by assuming shape, they do it
 by taking concrete form.”</p>

  <p><cite>Stanley Knowles</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While Bitcoin’s form is quite concrete since its inception, it is an
abstract, intangible form, making it exceptionally hard to grasp. It
will take some time until Bitcoin is as ubiquitous as the internet is
now. This time — this window of confusion — will be used and abused
by lawmakers and charlatans alike. However, it is also a window of
opportunity. An opportunity to sharpen our tools, to prepare for the
flood, to ship the future faster than they can ban it.</p>

They Are Always Wrong

<p>Undoubtedly, there are plenty of people who don’t want Bitcoin to
succeed. They will do everything in their power to prolong the
inevitable. They are wed to the current system, gaining from its
inherent imbalance. Some are close to the monetary spigot, or willfully
ignorant, or enemies of freedom in general. Others are outright evil,
aiming to become the foot that stomps on your face, forever.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“They told us not to wish in the first place, not to aspire, not to
try; to be quiet, to play nice, to shoot low and aspire not at all.
They are always wrong. Follow your dreams. Make your wishes. Create
 the future. And above all, believe in yourself.”</p>

  <p><cite>Joseph Michael Straczynski</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>They will continue to tell us that what we are doing is a pipe dream,
that what we are aiming for is impossible, that we can’t operate outside
of the current systems. They will restrict our freedoms: our freedom to
transact, our freedom to save, our freedom to remain private. They will
tell us that certain kinds of mathematics and software are illegal. They
will continue to justify mass surveillance by trying to sell us the
illusion of safety. And they will continue to be wrong.</p>

<p>Speak up. Be outraged. Use alternatives. Build alternatives. Don’t
settle for the status quo — we can do better. Bitcoin is what we make
of it, and I can’t imagine a better set of people to realize the full
potential of this grand idea.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is nothing better to be on a shared mission with extraordinary
people who can be radically truthful, and radically transparent with
 each other.”</p>

  <p><cite>Ray Dalio</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stay vigilant. Stay radical. Stay true to yourself. As the world is
grinding to a halt, and the fall of Rome becomes more likely than ever,
strong characters, sound principles, and truthful conduct are
imperative.</p>

<p>The stage is set, the drama is unfolding, and as the crescendo comes we
must not give in to tyranny. The path will be twisted and bumpy, and I’m
honored to walk it to the end, with you on my side. We got this.</p>

<p>This is the famous opening statement of Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty published by Carl Schmitt in 1922. This statement offers the fundamental axiom of how all sovereign power functions, and how the sovereign exception found in emergency legal decrees allows for any sovereign to overcome and dispose of the law. In the essay the political theology of crypto I explain how cryptography negates the possibility of the sovereign exception through the banishment physical and identifying power, which thereby erodes all forms of contemporary state and legal power. I have also wrote an essay on how the metaphysical tensions between any sovereign and any subject will always result in a power dynamic that where the sovereign decision will always over come any law in times of sincere crisis or emergency, and how cryptography negates this form of power. In this essay I would like to expound more deeply upon the explicit theology of bitcoin, its formula of power, and what it means for the fate of humanity in these darkest of times.</p>



Bitcoin as Subjectivity



<p>While bitcoin is inherently an object of war, it is also an object of art. Art because it is only an expression&#8211;an object of non-tangibility, and subjective individual human values according the society we live within. However, through a Hegelian synthesis of art and war; bitcoin spills out from the noosphere as a damnation of all fiat currencies of the world of flesh and steel, and the redemptive answer we seek to rescue and restore law, economy, and order from these crises forced upon them. Through the power of cryptography, and the systems of truth that it demands; Bitcoin expresses a form of truth that no human, institution, or organization is any longer capable of anywhere the physical realm or legal jurisdictions. </p>



<p>This artistic power of war that bitcoin harnesses comes from a totalizing deterritorialization and reterritorialization (in the Deleuzian sense of the word) of the global order through the initiation of a new plane of immanence based upon cryptographic power. This plane of immanence is the renewal of a nomos (law, customs, or social cohesion) of humanity with the internet at its organizational core, and truth as the form of legitimacy. It is a novus ordo seclorum where truth, not authority, becomes the renewed source of legitimacy for all people everywhere. Through the exchange of the legitimacy of power through the sacrifice of authoritarian decrees for the truth of what is, bitcoin inverts the sovereign formula of power. </p>



<p>Both Schmitt and Agamben, two of the leading scholars on the philosophy of sovereignty, define sovereignty as a boarderline concept that is traced throughout the theory of the state. Both conclude that sovereignty finds its foundation in the authentic decision that IS the sovereign exception of the law (also know as &#8216;a state of emergency&#8217; or &#8216;sovereign crisis&#8217;), not the norm. Schmitt surmises this as, &#8220;&#8216;All law is situational law.&#8217; The sovereign produces and guarantees the situation in its totality. He has the monopoly over this last decision.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is of great importance because it is through the sovereign exception found in emergency decrees all state law is doomed to the fascism inherent to it. There is no bearing or trace of truth in the sovereign exception; only the raw authoritative power that will justify any legal exceptions. The great father of the theory of the state himself, Thomas Hobbes surmised this in Leviathan rather flippantly as;</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Auctoritas, non veritas facit legem (authority, not truth makes legitimacy)&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>Schmitt, whom is among the most esteemed of legal scholars on Hobbes and his theory of the state, further surmises this point of how authority functions within the sovereign exception:</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The exception, which is not codified in the existing legal order, can at best be described as a case of extreme peril, a danger to the existence of the state&#8230; It is truly a matter of extreme emergency and how the emergency can be eliminated&#8230; From the liberal constitutional point of view, there would be no judicial competence at all. The most guidance the constitution can provide is to indicate who can act in such a case&#8230; He [the sovereign] decides if there is an extreme emergency as well as what must be done to eliminate it. Although he stands outside of the normally legally valid system, he nevertheless belongs to it, for it is he who must decide weather the constitution needs to be suspended in its entirety&#8230; Whether one has confidence and hope it can be eliminated depends on philosophical, especially on philosophical-historical or metaphysical convictions.&#8221;</p><cite>Carl Schmitt, Political Theology p. 7</cite></blockquote>



Bitcoin as Philosophical Conviction



<p>Bitcoin is the philosophical cognition of a world that has lost its nomos, where truth no longer a fact, but an opinion of power. Only in a world where seditious guile rules opening, where money is but a tool for the politically powerful, does bitcoin present its radical antithesis to the current paradigm of law, order, and sovereignty. It is the fulfillment of a crypto-anarchist critique of state, money, and legal power. </p>



<p>It is this philosophical conviction&#8211;particular the philosophical-historical  cognition of what cryptography is, how it was developed for total war, and what its development throughout the concourse of human history means; that we find a categorical imperative from which the sovereign exception can be totally and completely eliminated. Through the linguistic form that is cryptography; a demand is created that can only be answered in binary form of &#8216;yes, yes,&#8217; or &#8216;no, no,&#8217; and nothing else. It is a formula of true / false statements of output ownership protected by the magnanimity of cryptography, which creates the timechain of bitcoin, and the fulfillment of bitcoin&#8217;s oath to the cryptography that concretes it. </p>



<p>The sovereign legal form glitches out before naked truth and the total silent obligation that is the secret of all state power, arcana imperii: </p>



<blockquote><p>“The obligation of subjects to the sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power lasteth by which he is able to protect them. For the right men have by nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by no covenant be relinquished.”</p><cite>-Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan</cite></blockquote>



<p>A world that has lost its nomos is a world where no sovereign power, institution, or government can offer even the most basic protections or assurances that comprises of the dignity of life. While the law is suppose to be the fulfillment of the most basic promise of the social contract by the sovereign, we have entered into a territory where no such promise exist. The law today is little more than authoritarian approvals, appeals, rules, and decrees; lacking even the most basic contractual functions. Through the broken oaths of sovereign powers everywhere towards the most basic aspects of the social contract; all people everywhere have been forsaken, the truth of their laws and their justice corrupted in every way.  </p>



<p>In this darkest of nights however, there is a spectacular gem of truth from which light gleams and points towards our exit from this hollowed and damned place. Bitcoin and the cryptographic breakthroughs that it has ushered in over the last decade offers us a totally new and novel strategy of human organization that breaks out of the sovereign form and can restore law, order, and economy to their rightful places. As Foucault warned us, &#8220;In political and social theory, we still have not cut off the king&#8217;s head.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bitcoin and cryptography is a form of power that is beyond any physical force and the brutishness of any form of authoritarianism for the very real truth it must contain in order to function, and the very real protection that the cryptography it contains offers. Bitcoin is the premonition of an idea whose time has come; of a humanity that is ready to rise to its task of the abrogation of the statism, and to restore the political to its rightful place at the forefront of any law. </p>



<p>Bitcoin is a new form of political, economic, and moral organization that raises truth to being the only sacrosanct of any law. It is the philosophical cognition of a world that understands the insipid greed of men, and the infinite vice that is power. Bitcoin has enables a new form of digital organization that banishes the prattling lies of men, and demands the proof of any claim. Bitcoin does this through returning truth to its preeminent place as the foundation of all social contracts, and the meaning of truth in such agreements through the cryptographic formula of verification. </p>



Bitcoin as Political Theology 



<p>At the very end of Political Theology, Schmitt of all people, provides us with an anarchist&#8217;s critique of any sovereign decision by the very virtue of what any decision by a sovereign power must be and how it is decided:</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every claim of decision must be evil for the anarchist, because the right emerges by itself if the immanence of life is not disturbed by such claims. This radical antithesis forces him of course to decide against the decision; and this results in the odd paradox where Bakuin, the greatest anarchist of the nineteenth century, had to become in theory the theologian of the antitheological, and in practice the dictator of an antidictatorship.&#8221; </p><cite>Carl Schmitt, the final paragraph of Political Theology</cite></blockquote>



<p>It is this radical antithesis that has us also decide against the decision as well. We are products of the late 20th century; grandchildren of the spectacle society where all forms of life that would not be subjected to the machine were liquidated long ago. Now under the grimace of the total corruption of law, the complete looting of the treasuries of all peoples by political and corporate oligarchies everywhere from &#8217;emergencies&#8217; of their own creation; we find the reason for us to rise against, and choose to reclaim that which is only ours. This the reactivation of the political as the struggle for life, and the right to die trying; opens the truly political (polis) once again. </p>



<p>We understand how Bitcoin makes for the oddest of paradoxes; with anarchism becoming in theory the greatest form of &#8216;capitalism&#8217; against all states, and in practice, a dictatorship of privacy and pseudonymity which unrelentingly will not give itself to anyone but the individual. </p>



<p>Bitcoin rings with a thunderous crack, “Vires In Numeris” and becomes more powerful and fervent with each seeker that we convert. It is a political theology that restores truth as the final weapon against a system of lies, fear, and exploitation to renew the nomos of humanity, and for us all to discover that there is still a political to be claimed, but only for those who are willing to take the risk. </p>



The Revolutionary Truth Hidden in Bitcoin



<p>Having witnessed the twilight of humanity befall idiotic and empty slogans under the barbarism of statism&#8217;s vacant chanting of idiotic lies; the spectacle has envelopes all. In all of its grandeur of stupidity and lobotomization, state capitalism has fused with the totalitarian eye of the internet; idiotically  unaware of the beast it was unleashing, the prophecy it was fulfilling. </p>



<p>From the very outset, we can see the fundamental contradiction between the idea of sovereignty and the functions of cryptography. Cryptography is completely unanswerable to any sovereign power, as it lack the capacity to understand anything beyond its binary language of true or false, nor does it capitulate to any form of violence. The only laws that cryptography understands are the laws of mathematics which animates their functions.</p>



<p>By the very nature that no sovereign power can overcome the laws of mathematics that animate cryptographic systems, it points to the very nature of what crypto is and its hidden encrypted meaning. There is no emergency, war, pandemic or crisis that can stop bitcoin. Now there is only the real state of emergency to be introduced, and the final struggle in which we take our rightful place as the owner of ourselves, our political systems, and our wealth for those whom we hodl in common. </p>



<p>This is the political theology of Bitcoin, the radial promise of a machine of truth that can only speak in a binary of true or false, documenting its own claims of just that. From the outset of the creation of the timechain of Satoshi&#8217;s; Bitcoin has been nothing more than a mechanization of truth-telling of what address owns what bitcoin, and how many joules of energy were used to produce those bitcoins. </p>



<p>With each block that is built on the bitcoin timechain, it resounds and echos louder and louder against the backdrop of man and his fallen world of lies, deception, and deceit. Only in a time where man has become an insipid beast of guile and sophistry, where politicians and gangsters openly fraternize and discuss how to rape the world with no consequence to themselves, does the theology of bitcoin and the promise it cointains move from revolutionary to messianic. </p>



<p>There is no long any government anywhere that can offer the same promise as that of Bitcoin does. There is no central bank, no commodity form, no currency, no &#8216;crypto&#8216; outside of bitcoin that can offer the same assurances or security as bitcoin. The theological promise of bitcoin is that there will never be more than 21 million coins, and that there is no way to alter the supply schedule, or know exactly who owns what outputs. It is a new social contract based upon the inverted form of the sovereign dictum, with truth&#8211;not authority&#8211;being the legitimate maker of the law that is bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain.  </p>



<p>In a world where governments across the globe have promised to create infinite monetary units, swore everlasting loyalty to corporations and melomaniacs before their own citizens; the only thing left to do is refuse their broken social contract they call law, and create new ones better and more fitting for our times. Through the power, glory, and grace that is bitcoin, and for the magnanimous promise that Satoshi Nakamoto has delivered to us; bitcoin is the theological answer to the crises of our time. Its heliotropism directs us towards a world where we use cryptographic systems to verify the truth of all things, and utilize such a power to renew and recreate our systems of liberty and justice for all.</p>



<p>Satoshi Nakamoto&#8217;s promise of a money that does not change for the light and transient causes of mortals, nor bend to the callous and pathetic will of politicians around the planet has given us a light to follow in these darkest of times. It is the oath of the cryptographic machine to itself, and its total intransigence to change for any crisis, emergency, or state of exception. Though this most wonderful and theological of tasks, Satoshi Nakamoto has created the machine of economic redemption that we need to renew our world, to free ourselves from the chains of debt and bondage that governments around the globe have forced on to all of us. It is a method to renew the social contract to its original form, and what the promise of a social contract under the rubric of truth really means.</p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Every man having been born free and master of himself, no one else may under any pretext whatever subject him without his consent.&#8221;</p><cite>&#8211;Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract, 1762</cite></blockquote>

  <p>The world you know and love is no more, even if it isn’t obvious to
every one of you just yet. We will look back at this moment in time, the
months we are currently living through, the weeks that will mark the
line between the pre-virus and the post-virus world. One thing is clear:
we are past the inflection point.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when
decades happen.”</p>

  <p><cite>Vladimir Lenin*</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the events around the COVID-19 pandemic unfold, the fragility of our
global systems becomes painfully obvious. This health crisis is
triggering a financial one, and if we don’t get our act together, things
will go from bad to worse.</p>

The Legacy System is Crumbling

<p>Both our money and our financial system has fundamental issues. Ruled
from the top down by unelected decision-makers, these structures are not
equipped to handle complex problems. Even worse, trying to fix a complex
system by heavily interfering with natural processes will turn an
annoying mosquito problem into a deadly snake problem (with some frogs
in-between).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move
to higher levels.”</p>

  <p><cite>Albert Einstein</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centralization is efficient until it isn’t. I’m afraid that most of us
are going to learn this lesson the hard way: one by one, central points
of failure will crumble under the pressure of current world events, and
all we can do is watch our fragile legacy systems collapse (or turn into
Orwellian nightmares).</p>

<p>I’m not suggesting that all “old” systems are obsolete — they aren’t.
I’m suggesting that we are transitioning to a post-virus world, and it
will be impossible to understand what is going on — and how problems
might be solved — if you aren’t equipped to understand and use the
tools of this new era.</p>

A New Type of Thinking

<p>The tools of the post-virus world need to be transparent, open, and
freedom-enabling. Gatekeepers, censors, and arbitrary restrictions won’t
help us to solve the problems we are facing — they will only make
things worse. Information wants to be free, and we will need all the
information out in the open to fight the battles yet to come.</p>

<p>I can’t tell you what kind of tools will emerge. Instead, let me list
some things that are both of the utmost importance and difficult to
understand/accept if you come from the legacy world:</p>

<ul>
  <li>bitcoin</li>
  <li>the internet</li>
  <li>social media</li>
  <li>citizen journalism</li>
  <li>memes and misinformation</li>
  <li>open-source and free (libre) software</li>
</ul>

<p>Others aren’t as hard to understand, but equally important: encryption,
open hardware, biohacking, DIY biology, 3d printing, and other forms of
distributed manufacturing.</p>

<p>These tools and the new type of thinking that comes along with them will
lead to different structures, a different way of doing things, different
outcomes. It might seem strange and inefficient at times, and that’s
okay. The important part is that we move away from fragile systems and
central points of failure, building robust, and even anti-fragile
systems for generations to come.</p>

Fragile, Robust, and Anti-Fragile Systems

<p>The world is a scary, complicated, and chaotic place. Our
interconnectedness and interdependence have drastic and unforeseen
consequences, as the current pandemic shows so clearly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Someone ate a bat in China and now you don’t get to retire. Funny how
 the world works.”</p>

  <p><cite>Jeremy Ross</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many systems got centralized over time, moving from robustness to
fragility: the global financial system, various supply chains, large
parts of our media apparatus, and even the money we use daily.</p>

<p>Complex, large-scale problems require organic, bottom-up, emergent
solutions. We, as a society, need to make sure that robust solutions can
emerge, which implies that we need to protect personal liberties and
encourage personal responsibility more than ever.</p>

<p>It would be great if a benevolent ruler could step in and solve all our
problems. Unfortunately, every benevolent ruler transforms into a
totalitarian dictator given enough time. And I hope we can all agree
that we don’t need any more of those.</p>

<p>I would love to end on an optimistic note, but the future ahead will be
dark and bumpy, especially if the legacy world is all you know.</p>

  <p>As I have argued previously, Bitcoin is a living organism. But
where does this organism live, exactly? As with many questions in the world of
Bitcoin, exact answers are hard to come by. Living things have fuzzy edges:
beginnings and endings are hard to pin-point, differentiation is more-or-less
arbitrary, and what was classified as a wolf today might evolve to be a dog
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has no rigid specification, no absolute finality, no fixed development
team, no final security guarantees, no scheduled updates, no central brain, no
central vision, no kings, and no rulers. It is a decentralized organism,
organically evolving without central planners. The lack of any centralization is
the source of Bitcoin’s beauty, it’s organic behavior, and it’s resilience.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is everywhere and nowhere, which makes
figuring out where this thing lives a daunting task. However, it turns out that
there is a space it lives in. Multiple spaces, as we shall see.</p>

The Habitats of Bitcoin

<p>While classifying the habitat of a decentralized organism isn’t trivial, we can
look at the constituents of Bitcoin to make the task a bit easier. As outlined
in the last article of this series, Bitcoin lives across
domains, with one foot in the purely informational realm (ideas and code) and
one foot in the physical realm (people and nodes).</p>



  ♦




<p>An awareness of Bitcoin’s environment(s) might help to better understand this
new form of life. No organism can be meaningfully studied in isolation, and
Bitcoin is no exception. As Alan Watts pointed out, one has to be aware of the
basic unity every organism forms with its environment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For the ecologist, the biologist, and the physicist know (but seldom
feel) that every organism constitutes a single field of behavior, or
process, with its environment. There is no way of separating what any
given organism is doing from what its environment is doing, for which
reason ecologists speak not of organisms in environments but of
organism-environments.”</p>

  <p><cite>Alan Watts</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at the organism-environment(s) we
are dealing with. As outlined above, Bitcoin’s ideas and code inhabit one realm,
and Bitcoin’s people and nodes inhabit another. To stick with tradition, let’s
call the physical realm “meatspace” and the purely informational realm
“cyberspace” — even if, as always, the lines might be fuzzy around the
edges.</p>

<p>The “soul” of Bitcoin, so to speak, lives in cyberspace. There, Bitcoin
absorbs useful ideas and incorporates them into its code. As with all living
things, something is useful if it helps an organism to survive. While Bitcoin
has various self-regulatory mechanisms to react to the environment, new ideas
may be necessary for survival if changes are drastic enough.</p>

<p>The “body” of Bitcoin, like all bodies, is living in meatspace. Nodes, hard
drives, cables, and other things come together in an intricate dance, pushing
around electrons, changing zeros to ones and vice-versa, making sure that
Bitcoin’s heart beats about a thousand times a week.</p>

<p>Living things have an interest in staying alive, and the Bitcoin organism is no
exception. Bitcoin found an ingenious way to ensure that it stays alive: it pays
people, as Ralph Merkle pointed out. People — and increasingly, organizations
— are incentivized to keep it alive. They shape the physical world to
Bitcoin’s liking, feed it energy, renew its hardware, and update its software to
keep it alive.</p>

<p>The fact that Bitcoin pays us to keep it alive opens up a third space: a space
of financial transactions, value, and mutual beneficial exchange. Let’s call
this space “finspace.”</p>

<p>To understand finspace, we will have to examine the other side of this coin. So
far, we only examined the side with an uppercase B: the Bitcoin network. But
there is also bitcoin — with a lowercase b — which is the unit of value
itself, brought into existence by every copy of the ledger.</p>

<p>These bitcoins, while deeply embedded in the amber of the ledger, are traded
worldwide on various markets and marketplaces. And since these bitcoins — and
their value — are critical for Bitcoin’s survival, we will have to recognize
finspace as the third space this strange beast lives in. Note that finspace,
strangely enough, is solely inhabited by bitcoin with a lowercase b.</p>

<p>In total, we can identify three distinct environments which the Bitcoin organism
inhabits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cyberspace: the world of ideas and code.</li>
  <li>Meatspace: the world of people and nodes.</li>
  <li>Finspace: the world of value and markets; the world of dollars and sats.</li>
</ul>



  ♦




<p>Understanding these habitats becomes increasingly important, especially as the
climate in one — or more — heats up.</p>

The Climates They Are A-Changin’

<p>The three spaces outlined above — cyberspace, meatspace, and finspace — have
different restrictions; different climates, so to speak. In short: they operate
under different rules. Once these rules change drastically enough, people will
say that “the political climate is heating up” and reports on “the coming
financial climate” will be written. Citizens will be unable to speak and act
freely. If things change drastically enough, people will rise up in protest, or,
if all else fails, flee.</p>

<p>Cyberspace: While we don’t have precise words for it, it is obvious
that the climate in cyberspace has changed quite drastically in the last
two decades or so. The idealistic, utopian ideas which were the
foundation of most of the internet were perverted by the
advertisement-driven surveillance companies which are the giants of
today.</p>

<p>People and politicians are slowly waking up to the strange reality we are living
in: the fact that Facebook can manipulate moods and sway elections is as
disturbing as the fact that Google knows you better than you know yourself.
Edward Snowden showed that the most paranoid netizens were right all along:
everyone in cyberspace is under constant surveillance, without suspicion, by
default.</p>

<p>While the western world does not immediately feel the repercussions
that come with living in a constant state of surveillance, Chinese
citizens are gathering first-hand experience with each passing day.</p>

<p>In the western world, the consequences are advertisements which range from
annoying to spooky. In China, the consequences are frozen bank accounts, an
inability to buy train or plane tickets, elimination of creditworthiness,
automated fines for trivial offenses, and more. Voicing the “wrong” opinion —
online or not — can lead to restricted access to schools, hotels, and jobs.
And after ruining your life with the flip of a bit you will be publicly named as
a bad citizen and the government will take away your dog. If that doesn’t
sound dystopian enough for your taste I bet that it will be in a couple of
years. Remind yourself that this is only the beginning.</p>

<p>In the “free” world, things are more subtle. Multiple efforts are underway to
curb net neutrality, the very cornerstone of the internet. Legislation is being
passed which is inherently incompatible with the laws of cyberspace. It seems
like the last battle of the Crypto
Wars is yet to be fought as
politicians are calling for “responsible encryption” and the ban of certain CAD
files.
Companies are in charge of the speaker’s corners of cyberspace and are making
arbitrary decisions on what can be uttered by whom and what is off-limits.</p>

<p>Bitcoin knows no borders, no jurisdictions. However, it has to conform
to the laws of cyberspace — and if these laws change, e.g. if large
parts of the world block Bitcoin traffic and/or the usage of TOR, the
Bitcoin organism will have to adapt.</p>

<p>Meatspace: Meatspace climate differs wildly from jurisdiction to
jurisdiction. Some bastions of freedom still exist, but once you try to
board an international flight it becomes obvious that your right to
privacy and your freedom to bring a bottle of water with you are null
and void.</p>

<p>Protests across the globe indicate that the powerless are fed up with
the powerful, who do everything they can to stay in control and solidify
their positions of influence.</p>

<p>History shows that governments do not shy away from using their power. In 1933,
Executive Order 6102 was
signed, effectively forcing the whole population of the United States to hand
over their gold and gold certificates to the government.</p>



  ♦




<p>Yes, seizing bitcoin is way harder than seizing gold — in some cases
even impossible. But it would surprise me if those who currently control
our money — the governments and central banks of this world — would
simply roll over and let Bitcoin march on unhindered. Governments have a
monopoly on violence, and they are able and willing to abuse this
violence in their own interest.</p>

<p>With Bitcoin, however, people can flee a country with their wealth
intact. While this is definitely not easy, and not something I would
wish on anyone, it is now possible.</p>

<p>Finspace: Where should I even begin? The current, debt-based
financial system has an appetite for printing money which is beyond
belief. Quantitative Easing (QE), Negative Interest Rate Policies
(NIRPs), currency wars, hyperinflations, and a looming recession are
just a few of the recipes of the global instability soup which is
currently brewing.</p>

<p>The current financial system seems so far removed from common sense and
reality, that all the jargon in the world won’t be able to stabilize
this house of cards. People know that our money is broken, which is why
they flee to buying real estate, stocks, and all kinds of complicated
financial constructs to preserve their wealth. In the current system,
you have to be an investment expert just to hold your value.</p>

<p>And we haven’t even talked about the looming recession, and the virtual
inevitability of the next financial crisis yet. Yes, governments might
be able to kick the can down the road by printing ever more money. But
no road is endless, and the experiment which is fiat
money will come to an end, one way or the
other.</p>

<p>How bitcoin will react to a catastrophe in finspace is anyone’s guess.
Some people might flee from their failing fiat currency into bitcoin,
using it as a risk-off asset. Others might sell bitcoin to buy something
they consider more stable, such as real estate or land. A rising number
of people will identify bitcoin as the best money we ever had, shunning
other assets and other monies on the quest to stack as many sats as they
can.</p>

<p>However it might play out, Bitcoin is the cure for many of the current
system’s ills. It is hard money which doesn’t devalue over time. It is
an incorruptible system which forms the basis of a new financial
reality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It can’t be changed. It can’t be argued with. It can’t be tampered
with. It can’t be corrupted. It can’t be stopped. It can’t even be
interrupted.”</p>

  <p><cite>Ralph Merkle</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the above, it seems to have many indirect effects. It
lowers the time preference of those who use it. It incentives users to
have better personal and operational security. It incentives individuals
and companies to have better digital hygiene. It propels the development
of chip manufacturing and encryption technology.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin definitely influences its environments and vice-versa, how
Bitcoin reacts to drastic changes is yet to be seen.</p>

Migration

<p>Bitcoin lives on the internet, as Ralph Merkle points out. The internet,
however, is not a necessary requirement for Bitcoin to work. Bitcoin is
text
— pure information — and every system capable of transmitting (and
storing) information is a potential habitat for the Bitcoin organism.
The internet just happens to be the most suitable habitat which
currently exists, since it is the most efficient system to transmit
information we have to date.</p>

<p>Cyberspace: The Bitcoin organism could migrate to other
environments, and multiple efforts are underway which enable Bitcoin to spread
to places where access to Internet infrastructure is limited or non-existent. As
of this writing, Bitcoin transactions (and LN invoices) have been sent via
radio waves, mesh, and satellite networks — just to name a few. All
of these can be seen as Bitcoin conservation efforts, so to speak.</p>

<p>Whether we will see the migration of Bitcoin to another system in the
decades and centuries to come depends, in essence, on whether the
internet will remain a suitable habitat or not. If the online climate
changes drastically enough, we might see the migration to even more
resilient, less restrictive environments.</p>

<p>Meatspace: We can already see that mining facilities pop up where
energy is cheapest or even stranded. In essence, mining is done where it
makes the most sense — economically speaking. The same is true for
running nodes. If people can run nodes at low risk and near zero
marginal cost, they will. Thus, visualizing Bitcoin on a map, nodes and
mining facilities migrate geographically from unfriendly places to
friendlier places over time. Unprofitable mining facilities will shut
down, profitable mining facilities will go online. The same, again, is
true for nodes.</p>

<p>Increasingly, people will migrate to jurisdictions which are more
favorable to their bitcoin holdings. And if you want to start a Bitcoin
company, you might also move to a jurisdiction which is more favorable
to you and your future business.</p>

<p>Finspace: In the last 10 years, many people decided to buy bitcoin,
effectively feeding the Bitcoin organism by investing in it. This
capital allocation will continue as more people understand the nature of
this beast, and the ultimate goal of Bitcoin: the separation of money
and state.</p>

<p>What investors describe as portfolio balancing and allocation of capital can be
seen as a migration of value from worse assets to better assets; from bad stores
of value to better stores of value. Bitcoin, being the ultimate asset in terms
of portability, verifiability, divisibility, scarcity, and unseizability, will
continue to suck up value and grow in the process.</p>

Conclusion

<p>Bitcoin lives at the intersection of three spaces: meatspace, cyberspace,
and finspace. These spaces have different laws, different rules, and different
climates. To fully understand any organism, we must not only look at the
organism itself, but examine the organism-environment holistically.</p>

<p>Because of its decentralized nature, Bitcoin is able to overcome many, if not
all obstacles in its environments. It can migrate to favorable jurisdictions in
meatspace, use different transportation and storage media in cyberspace, and
feed on the instability of other asset classes in finspace.</p>

<p>Whatever the future may bring, Bitcoin is equipped to survive and thrive in the
various environments it lives in. It is remarkably resilient — well adapted to
survive any coming storm, however perfect it may be.</p>

  <p>In this epic piece, Robert Breedlove takes a massive dive into Bitcoin, and presents one of the most solid cases for Bitcoin that’s out there.</p><p>That said, it’s not always easy to get the very busy (and skeptical) Ray Dalio’s of the world to sit down for a few hours, so I hope this cover letter can encourage him to have an open mind, and give Bitcoin a few hours of his time. ROI on those few hours could be bigger than any return he’s witnessed in his highly illustrious and successful career.</p>♦<p>Bitcoin is most definitely not an “easy get”. Most ultra-bullish Bitcoiners only become that way due to a deep understanding of the history and properties of money-as-we-know-it, the technology behind Bitcoin, macro, micro and behavioural economics, as well as the dynamics of start-up companies and technologies in bootstrapping themselves and realising network effects. Less technical people observe the IQ density of the space, through its industry leaders and broader development community, which allows for a high level of believability-weighted decision making. I believe you have one of the best grasps of these concepts in the world, so I ask that you humour me for a few minutes to allow me to demonstrate just how much Bitcoin aligns with your personal views and fundamentals. This journey isn’t quick — the most dedicated Bitcoiners have put in thousands of hours of research and knowledge development, as well as many hundreds of days “in the saddle” with exposure to the whims of the Bitcoin Rollercoaster. I hope that by the end of this letter you will at least consider revisiting the topic of Bitcoin with a bit more depth.</p><p>Bitcoin has been likened by some to be reflective of a startup organisation; currently heading into its Series B fund raise. Bitcoin is a well-oiled “un-organization” with founders but no CEOs, many volunteers but no employees, where the best ideas are developed and implemented by consensus regardless of who proposed the idea, and provably non-diluting equity available to anyone who is willing to trade their energy for it. This is all baked into the code, and it is radically transparent for anyone wishing to participate in the ecosystem. So transparent, that an individual can verify anything they need to about the Bitcoin network by simply running some software on a very basic computer setup in the order of $200 and with the most basic of internet connections. It may likely be one of the best real-life examples of an Idea Meritocracy at play — the cultural paradigm that you originated at Bridgewater.</p><p>Idea Meritocracies are microcosms of what a “truly free” market should be. There aren’t many, if any, examples of free markets in the wild; except of course, Bitcoin. The competition in the Bitcoin space is merciless, where the best products having a shelf-life of months before being made redundant by superior products. Most industry leading service providers will find themselves competing with a free product not long after establishing themselves. As at date of writing, the Bitcoin space even meets several criteria of the “theoretical” perfectly competitive market. Bitcoin’s nature as an open-source, public, encrypted, distributed ledger means that the blockchain guarantees radical transparency, property rights and homogeneity of product, at zero or near-zero transaction and storage cost. The factors of production (labour, equipment, and capital) are mobile to the extent that only a communication link and a power source is required to participate in the ecosystem. Developing on top of Bitcoin requires no permission, and if entrepreneurs have a good enough idea, securing start-up capital is not a difficult barrier to entry to overcome. Information asymmetry, low number of market participants, and externalities from use of non-renewable energy to mine will all be resolved in time, most likely by the end of this decade. The critical thing to note is, although there are relatively few people who own the majority of Bitcoin now, once Bitcoin is spent in the future during the redistribution phase, it is spent forever — there are no reprints. If you want your Bitcoin balance to stay the same or increase, you must be creating value for someone. There is no free lunch with Bitcoin.</p><p>A central tenet of your school of thought is open-mindedness, and I encourage you to suspend disbelief and allow yourself to be immersed in high quality Bitcoin content; whether through attending a Bitcoin-only conference, books, podcasts, or even attending your local casual Bitcoin meetup. When meeting Bitcoiners in the real world, you are guaranteed to witness more IQ packed into one small place than you have ever witnessed in your life. Bitcoin was created and fostered by the most radically open-minded, and the development of its technology over time was only possible through radical open-mindedness in the developer community, and of the wider user community once improvements were thoroughly scrutinised and ready to be implemented.</p><p>I’m sure that a lot of these arguments have hit home — after all, you personally coined the majority of the arguments I used to present The Case for Bitcoin. It is daunting and confusing to step into such a revolutionary realm, but you will find that if you are willing to radically open your mind, your fundamentals are 100% aligned with Bitcoin’s.</p>♦

  Adapting Schmitt&#8217;s Theory of the Partisan for Digital Space



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The terrible transformation of the world, which has been accomplished by the headlong expansion of power, lies in that things beyond the measure of our physically given sense of perception have been made visible, audible, perceptible; perceptible and thus capable of possession.  The new concept of ownership, or much more: the domination of the functions; cuius regio, eius economia [Whose realm, his economics], is now cuius economia, eius regio [Whose economics, his realm]. The new Nomos [law, custom, or social fabric] of the earth; no more Nomos.&#8221;  </p><cite>&#8211;Carl Schmitt, Glossarium, 1947</cite></blockquote>



<p>To expand upon the hypothesis that bitcoin and crypto assets are explicit military assets of war, I would like to extend my analysis into the new topographical space that is the internet and how war will be conducted in this space through the lens of Carl Schmitt&#8217;s Theory of the Partisan (ToP). </p>



<p>This shall be part of a larger series attempting to marry the theories of sovereignty of Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin, Giorgio Agamben to cryptosovereignty. Through taking Schmitt&#8217;s work (as I have done before with Political Theology) and applying these ideas towards Bitcoin specifically and crypto on a whole, we will have a much better understanding of cryptography&#8217;s relationship to war. Through analyzing Bitcoin as a preeminent tool of war, and how anyone may use this power to become a &#8216;crypto-partisan&#8217;, we start to unveil the radical power hidden at the heart of Bitcoin. It is the episteme of cryptography in the digital age; the rhizome which allows for the deterritorialization and remapping of the global (and eventually cosmic space) along new territorial lines that will renewed the nomos of humanity. </p>



<p>Through extending ToP to the digital age, and by understanding crypto as first and foremost as a technology of asymmetrical defensive warfare, we can see the new topographical lines that the internet opens to warfare. By understanding cryptography as the key technique of this new figure of history&#8211;the crypto partisan&#8211;and their hidden revolutionary war, we can come to understand the truly explosive potential of what is hidden in &#8216;crypto&#8216;. It is from here that we can understand what the coming new nomos of humanity will look like through the use of cryptography as the base technique to reorganize the political, and come to challege the nation-state itself. </p>



<p> As Schmitt explicitly states at the very end of (ToP): </p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The theoretician can do no more than verify concepts and call things by name. The theory of the partisan flows into the question of the question of the concept of the political, into the question of the real enemy and of a new nomos of the earth.&#8221; </p></blockquote>



<p>Through a deep reading of ToP, we can extend its theory of war into the current digital age and illuminate a &#8220;new theory of war and enmity&#8221; hidden at the center of cryptography. It is a novus ordo seclorum created from the new kind of social contract that is hidden in crypto and the promise that must Bitcoin must cointain.   </p>



Aspects And Concepts Of The Last Stage



<p>Let us begin where Schmitt left off in the final chapter of ToP in defining the last stages of the evolution of the partisan. By extending and updating this analysis into the current age with the same methodology that Schmitt uses, we can trace the evolution of the partisan from a telluric power to a caelumic [Caelus, Sky] one. Through tracing the linage of the partisan from &#8220;the national and patriotic heros who take to the woods, i.e., all that is characteristics of the elemental, telluric power to repel a foreign invader&#8221; to the current space the digital partisan is native to, we find a new understanding of the topology of war. It is one in which the potestas spiritualis [spiritual authority] of the land empire of the state is abandoned for the unidentifiability and infinite topological space of the &#8216;caelumic&#8216; nature of cryptography in the digital age. </p>



<p>We will follow the four concepts that Schmitt defines in ToP: the spatial aspect; the destruction of social structures; the interlocking global-political context; and lastly, the technical industrial aspect, of which all feedback into the later for our first analysis. Through a deconstruction of these concepts through the lens of Bitcoin, what crypto means in a Big Brother globalized society of advanced surveillance, and the total unbracketed civil warfare (stasis) that is the destruction of privacy by all states; we start to see the topography of this last stage of total unbracketed war. Here in the thick fog of war, we see the ghostly spectre of the caelumic nature of the crypto partisan as the final figure of the coming cyphernet. </p>



The Spatial Aspect



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Completely independent of the good or ill of men, of peaceful or hostile purposes and goals, any enhancement of human technology produces new horizons and unforeseeable changes in the traditional spatial structure.&#8221;</p><cite>Carl Schmitt, ToP, p. 68</cite></blockquote>



<p>Bitcoin is the technological development of our age which has opened a new horizon for human action and freedom through the fundamental transformation of the topographical spaces of both property and war. Through the novel and unforeseeable consequence of what bitcoin has enabled through cryptography; Bitcoin has secretly declared war on every state, and all fiat money&#8211;the nourishment of any modren state. By changing the topography of economics to one totally digital in nature, and by using the mathematical forces of cryptography to create provable systems of protection, we find that crypto economics inverts state economics, fulfilling what is quoted at the beginning of this article: cuius regio, eius economia [Whose realm, his economics], is now cuius economia, eius regio [Whose economics, his realm] (Schmitt, Glossarium, 1947).</p>



<p>By sacrificing the realm of the law, for the imperium of cryptography, Bitcoin has inverted the order of law through expropriating the realm of economics into the digital as an explicit strategy not to escape the law; but to destroy it. Through this totally non-violent economic praxis that strikes directly at the root of the state&#8217;s gluttonous ways through fiat money and the seigniorage it must contain; Bitcoin creates an economic strategy of starving the Behemoth of government through withdrawing one&#8217;s economic wealth from its parasitic and criminal ways.</p>



<p>Now that bitcoin has broke the link between the state and capital, the final existentialist crisis of law, the emergency of cryptography may begin. </p>



<p>In conjunction to the direct protection of cryptography that is used to shield one&#8217;s identity (and thus depriving the state of being able to label on as &#8216;friend&#8217; or &#8216;enemy&#8217; of the state) and command total privacy, the Bitcoin blockchain itself is simply a function of truth-in-account for bitcoin units. All units of the system must have proof-of-work&#8211;real thermodynamic energy expenditure behind them in order to be minted or exchanged.  In other words,  </p>



“Veritas, non auctoritas facit legem.” 



<p>(Truth, not authority makes legitimacy) </p>



<p>This is an inversion of Hobbes&#8217; dictum of sovereign power found in Leviathan, and is a weaponized form of truth in a world that is governed by lies that go so deep, it is simply called authority or law. </p>



<p>The spatial aspect of the evolution of warfare into a digital topology will always flow back into the natural defensive posture that crypto takes within the confines of the internet, and the citadel of the cyphernet that it is building as the premonition of the coming crypto age. It is in this last stage of development where the state has anointed itself as a god capable of anything, demanding to know all about everyone&#8211;there becomes nothing, nothing outside of the state&#8211;not even life. This causes for zone of indistinction that blurs all of life, politicizing everything, always reserving the right to criminalize anyone, depriving them of all economic, social, and political means and ultimately the rights to a life itself. </p>



<p>In this zone of indistinction, where the private life and political cause obscure so deeply with each other that they become one; economics itself corroborates with the security state, completely destroying the political concept of the commonality of wealth; namely the most basic commonality: the law itself. </p>



<p>It is the destruction of the polis through the fusion of bios and zoe into one, that has allowed for the creation of the infinitely watching eyes and ears of the technological panopticon. This surveillance apparatus exist to ensure that no one may have any real privacy anymore and that any human may be captured by it, and pulled beyond the law. This is the real state of emergency that has already destroyed our laws, our nomos. </p>



<p>This battle over the law is a stasis; a never-ending global civil war that contains all of life, and every nation-state on the planet. It is bellum omnium contra omnes of the greatest order. Or as Foulcault said more eloquently, &#8220;Isn’t power a sort of generalised war which assumes at particular moments the forms of peace and the State? Peace would then be a form of war, and the State a means of waging it.”</p>



<p>While the darkness and fundamental evil that is at the root of such a vision of paranoia and delusional psychosis that is the totalitarian surveillance  state of the modern age is difficult to look at; it is the world that we now live within, and is a fundamental fact that we must deal with. However, with such gross and systematic violations of not just privacy, but all of our God-given rights, the coming shipwreck of politics and law is already written, the crisis only needs to begin. </p>



<blockquote><p>“The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “emergency situation” in which we live is the rule. We must arrive at a concept of history which corresponds to this. Then it will become clear that the task before us is the introduction of a real state of emergency; and our position in the struggle against Fascism will thereby improve.”</p><cite>-Walter Benjamin,&nbsp;On the Concept of History, VII</cite></blockquote>



<p>Is there no state that does not demand to violate every single person&#8217;s privacy for the safety and security of the state? Is there no person that cannot be labeled &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217; to become be deprived of all rights and law?  This current state of emergency that has become all of our lives has violated all spaces of privacy, and demanded to interlope into all facets of life. There is no longer any space in which any person may be left alone. </p>



<p>The expansion of the surveillance state into the digital sphere is its final projection of power, and its attempt to abolish privacy through this technology is its final move in the consideration of power under this state of emergency. It is where the state can attempt to fulfill its bureaucratic destiny of attempting to seeing all things and attempt to organize all of human life and activity under the sinister rubric of &#8220;society must be defended.&#8221; </p>



<p>With Big Brother leering down at all of us with hate, vile, and contempt for the meager possibly of being an enemy; we see the digital cages and open air prisons being formed around us. It is a reality where each one of us will be ascribed digital signatures (not unlike the tattoos of the victims of the holocaust) which chains each of us to data to enables a kafkaesque reality&#8211;a total surveillance state. It is a reality in which we never know if we are really being watched or not; if we will ever get access to the law, or only stand waiting before it, hoping to one day have access. </p>



<p>At the same time that the noose of the panopticon is tightening around each one of us; the true nature and power of cryptography presents itself in all of its glory. It is the final unstoppable individual right and choice to create privacy through cryptography, and to choose to create the personal wealth and freedom that allows for anyone to slip free of this noose. Through the infinite brinkmanship of privacy violations by the state and their corporate allies; so too is the development, deployment, and dissemination of personal open-sourced cryptographic technologies, and the ability to resist such personal privacy violations. </p>



<p>This brinkmanship of surveillance ends with the state demanding to know everything about every person for reasons that are state secrets&#8211;classified only for the worthy state agents and secret spy courts to know and decide upon. Naturally, through the expansion of the surveillance state into the digital sphere and the private lives of everyone; a total unbracketed civil war on privacy itself is initiated. The theater of this total unbracketed war of surveillance now opens into the plains of our private homes and into the digital noosphere that contains all of modern life. </p>



<p>In a world where privacy is being destroyed by every state, the crypto-partisan naturally presents himself as the final revolutionary figure to counter to such a nightmarish panopticon. With Satoshi Nakamoto at the helm of this new class of anonymous crypto-anarchist vanguard, the new topography of war displays itself momentarily as the fog of war shifts to a new dimension and space; where a new social order is being established beyond physical lines. </p>



Destruction of The Social Order



<blockquote><p>&#8220;A Commonwealth exists as res publica, as a public sphere, and is challenged if a non-public space develops within it, which actually repudiates this public sphere. Perhaps this explanation is sufficient to demonstrate that the partisan, who displace the technical-military conduct of the 19th century, suddenly reappeared as the focus of a new type of war, whose meaning and goal was the destruction of the existing social order.&#8221; </p><cite>ToP. p. 72</cite></blockquote>



<p>At the dawn of the 21st century, the internet ushered in something totally new and unexpected&#8211;a new kind of surveillance that could look directly into the homes and lives of people. With this the machine of state capitalism could accelerate its plans for The End of History and The Last man, with man&#8217;s final consignment to a safe life in the walled gardens of state capitalism; the empty promises of liberalism with a &#8220;safe&#8221; life of endless worthless empty work. It was the final bold move in the shift from state capitalism to oligopolic empire, that the technological panopticon became the device of power to bridge this gap.</p>



<p>While both the state and its greedy allies of consumerism could see the potential of the new data people were generating as early as the turn of the century; the full scope of the technological panopticon could not be complete without a &#8216;state of emergency&#8217; that would allow for the full-scale, uncensored spying on all information generated by everyone. The idea of privacy itself had to be destroyed, and only a state of emergency would suffice for such a bold violation of personal privacy and civil liberties. </p>



<p>It is this &#8216;state of emergency&#8217; which would allow for the full liquidation of all constitutional rights, and to allow for systematic, pervasive, all-seeing surveillance to watch everyone, everywhere, all the time, for any reason it sees fit under the sinister slogan &#8216;Society Must be Defended&#8216;. This opportunity for such a state of emergency would come on September 11th, 2001, with the terrorist taking center stage of the political theater that would ensnare the lives of every person on the planet. Through the panopticon of global surveillance that could now be justified through the emergency to &#8216;stop the terrorist&#8217; a state-security based network of globalized monitoring is being deployed. </p>



<p>The Chinese Communist Party has perfected this &#8217;emergency&#8217; and created a surveillance panopticon for the horrific purpose of genocide and ethnic cleansing. They have already started exporting this technology, and the window of opportunity to fight back is dwindling quickly. </p>



<p>With the mechanical eye of the machine of the state starring directly each of us, appraising each move, twitch, and shift we make, constantly seeking to appraise if we, the subject, is a political friend or enemy that must be subjected to punishment and discipline. This was my point in the sovereign, the subject and crypto power, is that anyone can be deprived of their rights from any state for reasons that are deem &#8216;state secrets&#8217; to everyone. </p>



<p>The internet has destroyed all old social orders, and concepts of privacy, fully liquidating them around the global through the power of the panopticon. This has allowed for governments, businesses, or organizations anywhere to reach directly into the lives of anyone they see fit. Through the destruction of privacy, the social order is liquidated and replaced by the governmental rules of any state; whatever color of greed or oppression they may be. </p>



<p>Only in the total darkness and raw authoritarianism of &#8216;the state of emergency&#8217; would the the total destruction of all social orders and private wealth be possible. This is the real state of emergency is the impossibility of a private life, or a private wealth that is beyond the state for any reason. With the social order is collapsing into itself, the state leaves no remainder between private and public life. Life itself becomes a zone-of-indifference in which there can be no private life without the state for any reason. </p>



<p>It could only be from a world of this madness that something as miraculous as Bitcoin could be produced. Something like Bitcoin could have only been created in a world where law had abandoned itself totally for the banal avarice of greed and petty material things generations ago. Only in a world where the stupidity and vacuity of a world ran under the slogan of “Auctoritas, non veritas facit legem” (Authority, not truth makes legitimacy) could the truth of something like Bitcoin go beyond being just revolutionary and become the Parousia itself. </p>



Global-Political Context



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The partisan is dependent on the constant help of a community in a technical-industrial position to provide him with the newest weapons and machinery.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p.75</cite></blockquote>



<p>It was only after the failure of the Soviet Project was the possibility of the global technological revolution that is the single internet possible. Only a widely deployed, global, single decentralized internet would be able to developed its own culture, identity, norms, and most importantly ethics that would produce Bitcoin; but also cultivate and raise cryptography on a whole to where it is today. The Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace more than twenty years ago already contains embryo of values that are reflected in the current autochthonous culture of the internet that has propelled crypto and Bitcoin to where they are today. </p>



<p>Since Barlow&#8217;s declaration decades ago, a whole generation of people have been raised on the internet who have similar sentiments, values, and desires as reflected in that declaration. These are the people who would be called the indigenous of the internet; the caelumic peoples of this noosphere that is only ours. These natives understand that the machine of technology is but a tool for the extensions of their own power. They are the ones who have built this place and are starting to realize the reality of what they can do with such a power. It is from these indigenous people that a renewed commonality of wealth has been forged where the motto &#8216;Pro Aris et Focis&#8216; rings true for a new class of people and their coming of age. </p>



<p>It was however only with governments turning this technology against their own citizens that the struggle for this technology first started to grow. While the anarchist roots of the cypherpunks have always been present, it was only with these struggles that crypto-anarchist were produced through the code they deployed. Here we find the first traces of crypto-partisan, and the rudimentary tools from which he will liberate himself from the walled garden of society which has become a prison for all.</p>



<p>It is with the turn where governments everywhere are deploying digital technology only for the systematic violation of their own citizens, and to more deeply entrench bureaucratic controls for their own power does the crypto-partisan&#8217;s shadow start to be seen. It is from beyond the bondage of identity that he whispers secret facts that are not part of the propaganda agenda, or official media to be consumed. Facts are offered on how to escape from the incessant monitoring, how to create assured privacy, and where to find tools to hack the system and go beyond their sight and permissions. It is a praxis of blinding the technological machine and using that position as a fulcrum of power. </p>



<p>The crypto partisan offers tools and technology of the mind, methods of spiritual sacrimony, and the ability to create a private God to whom only you are privy with. It is a power to see beyond the veil of economic slavery to show anyone that there is something much, much more to this place than meets the eye. It is the possibility that we may each unlock as we start to understand the hidden power lying waiting at the center of Bitcoin, waiting for only the worth to have. </p>



<p>It is the premonition of a world that has lost its nomos; a world waiting for its providence after god has died and enough time has passed to try to remember Him, and the grace and glory of his being-in-the-world. </p>



<p>As one of the greatest poets of modren history has foretold: </p>



<blockquote><p>Armies cannot stop an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. No army can stop an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. Nothing&nbsp;is&nbsp;as powerful as an idea whose&nbsp;time has come. There&nbsp;is&nbsp;one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that&nbsp;is&nbsp;an idea whose&nbsp;time has come.</p></blockquote>



The Technical-Industrial Aspect



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Only revolutionay war made him [the partisan] a key figure of world history.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p. 77</cite></blockquote>



<p>Today the figure of the partisan is absolutely seen in the image of Satoshi Nakamoto&#8211;the first vanguardist of the crypto age. He alone initiated the total unbracketed war against all state using an explicit strategy of non-violent economic action through asymmetric cryptographic techniques to wage his revolutionary war. In taking this action, along with the political statement etched into the genesis block for all of time to see, Satoshi&#8217;s war started more than a decade ago and has been secretly building towards its revolutionary cause ever since. Satoshi, by perfectly obfuscating the image of the digital partisan, and the image of the bitcoiner, he created a new form of partisan for his war in the digital space; the crypto-partisan. </p>



<p>It is this figure, the Anonymous Other with loyalty to no state and conceals his identity for his protection alone, who is also the crypto partisan. It is this figure who has caelumic roots found directly in the internet who can call this territory local and their home. The crypto-partisan has a desire to keep the internet open-sourced, with strong privacy, and no boarders.  The crypto-partisan has no need for physical identities, and can stands on their own merit and signature alone. There is no need for police or physical corrosion here; just the code alone. </p>



<p>With bombaste and zeal like no other, the crypto partisan techniques go well beyond the mechanization of the code, and into the theater of politics and art alike. It is a pathos of war robbed of is physical nature and where the topology of war evolves beyond physical space, where violence no longer hodls any sway. </p>



<blockquote><p> The sovereign is the point of indistinction between violence and law, the threshold on which violence passes over into law and law passes over into violence.  </p><cite>— Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer</cite></blockquote>



<p>The crypto partisan is a new figure of history, someone who is beyond the physical realm and was produced from a series of extreme techniques of war in order to create perfect forward secrecy for the protect of one&#8217;s physical security. Such a power could only be created when the technicity of cryptography had reached such a zenith that it became a permeant feature for secure communications, which in turn could create economic security. Once this technique was globally disseminated, it was only a matter of time before the core values of cryptography would start to assert their real personal, economic, and social value against other such false non-values positioned by an old and dying society that will not relinquish its bloody authority.  </p>



<p>Schmitt, in reflecting on the nature of this technicity stated, </p>



<blockquote><p>&#8220;Pure technicity, as obtained in such purely technological reflections, produces no theory of the partisan, but only an optimistic or pessimistic series of more or less powerful assertions of value and non-value. Value, as Ernst Forsthoff aptly put it, has &#8220;its own logic,&#8217; namely, the logic of non-value and the destruction of the bearer of non-value.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p. 77</cite></blockquote>



<p>This quote can only offer its full understanding after reading the short essay, &#8220;The Tyranny of Values.&#8221; By understanding Bitcoin as a form of value that demands to assert itself against non-value through the total security of cryptography by being beyond any law, we can understand the need for Bitcoin to destroy fiat money because of the inherit non-value it must contain. Here is a longer quote explaining this &#8220;value-setting&#8221; and its antagonistic nature:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The genuinely subjective freedom of value-setting leads, however, to an endless struggle of all against all, to an endless bellum omnium contra omnes. In such circumstances, the very presuppositions about a ruthless human nature on which Thomas Hobbes’ philosophy of the state rests, seem quite idyllic by comparison. The old gods rise from their graves and fight their old battles on and on, but disenchanted and, as we today must add, with new fighting means that are no longer weapons, but rather abominable instruments of annihilation and processes of extermination, horrible products of value-free science and of the technology and industrial production that follow suit. What for one is the Devil is God for the other…It always happens that values stir up strife and keeps enmity alive. The fact that the debunked old gods have become merely valorized values only renders the struggle more ghostlike and the fighters hopelessly dogmatic.”</p><cite>&#8211;ToP. p. 79</cite></blockquote>



<p>To display the real wealth that Bitcoin contains, both as a system of rules which is the Bitcoin blockchain and the monetary system it contains; it must assert its superiority as a money and contract system against fiat money and state legal systems antagonistically. Bitcoin does this by presenting its inviolable nature against any and all state legal systems, and Bitcoin&#8217;s total indifference to them. The most important feature of this indifference is akin to a flower in the darkest of night. Despite the seemingly total darkness, there is still a secret, natural heliotropism towards the direction of the night from which sunlight must come which the flower will always turn to before any light may be seen.  </p>



<p>Bitcoin presents a new form of value through cryptography which assures and proves itself in this fallen world where money has been totally corrupted by the state. The &#8216;value&#8217; of fiat money today is little more than political approval to spend one&#8217;s money how one wishes. Fiat money is a form of value that is devoid of real wealth because of it lacks true property rights&#8211;fiat money can always be seized by the state, for whatever reason they see fit. It is a kind of false value that can only find value within the confines of law, and not beyond it. </p>



<p>With the wide dissemination of strong encryption techniques, and the miraculous gift that is Bitcoin, there is hope for something radically and fundamentally different from the false value of fiat money. The possibly to resist the totalitarian surveillance machine with these revolutionary tactics of cryptography has already been initiated, and this should be understood as the natural development of &#8216;crypto&#8217; for the episteme it is. </p>



Legality and Legitimacy 



<p>This is the title of his 1932 essay on the topic of legality and legitimacy. In this essay where Schmitt predicted the fall of the Weimar Republic, and the seizure of power by either the Nazis or the communist due the the failings that are inherent to liberal constitutionalism itself. Schmitt understood that through trying to integrate enemies under the great umbrella of parlamentarism, it created the very conditions for its own downfall. This parlamentarism denies the enmity between peoples who no longer seek to negotiate freedoms with one another; but wish to actively suppress one another using the state.  </p>



<p>Schmitt gave himself over to the Nazis, and was even the mouthpiece of explaining Hitler&#8217;s actions during the The Night of Long Knives. In explaining this action (taking a clear nod towards Mussolini&#8217;s actions in the Matteotti Crisis) Schmitt gave the judicial explanation which cleared the way for fascism in Germany to seize hold. The method of how this happened clearly has infected our current legal system, and is the method by which the law has been destroyed through its stratification. </p>



<p>This was my point in the sovereign, the subject, and crypto-power.  We are no longer citizens that are subject to the law, but are already captured within a framework where we will never gain access to the law by possibility of being an &#8216;enemy combatant&#8217;. Through the labeling of &#8216;enemy of the state,&#8217; the state can turn anyone into a nemesis that cannot be given access to the law, but only a terrorist to be deprived of it.</p>



<p>Schmitt revisits this idea in ToP, which displays the important connection of legality and legitimacy to the partisan and the legitimization of his idea of just war. </p>



<p>Without the legitimacy of a political movement to which the partisan can be attached; his actions are simply crime, and the revolutionary nature of his work can always be relegated to the criminal world. However, it is once his actions as a soldier of war have been linked to that of a political movement, that the final Clausewitzian turn can be fulfilled with, &#8220;war being the continuation of political by other means.&#8220;</p>



<p>In order for the crypto partisan to move beyond that of the meager hacker and criminal, he must link up with and legitimize his movement with other contemporary political movements. He must create known and open political objectives for his movement with a general understanding of who the real enemy is. In short, the crypto-partisan must find his natural allies through political movements which demand the full recognition of who the enemy is, what their violations are, and what must be done to remit such damages. </p>



The Real Enemy



<blockquote><p>&#8220;The enemy is not someone who, for some reason or other, must be eliminated and destroyed because he has no value. The enemy is on the same level as I am. For this reason, I must fight him to the same extent and within the same bounds as he fights me, in order to be constant with the definition of the real enemy by which he defines me.&#8221;</p><cite>ToP p.85</cite></blockquote>



<p>It must be understood the the enemy is a limited character. The enemy only defines himself insofar that we both desire to end hostilities and creates some means of peaceable agreement between us. This is the bracketing effect of modern war that Schmitt starts ToP with, speaks about how the bracketing of Napoleonic wars allowed for the Concert of Europe and the century of &#8216;peace&#8217; that came from that. This bracketing of war, is what has allowed for states to stop distracting themselves with fighting each other, and to turn to look at their own citizens as the absolute enemy. </p>



From The Real Enemy to The Absolute Enemy 



<p>The real enemy is each of our respective governments against each of us as individual human beings. They have become the absolute enemy because they will not recognize the absolute protection that the law demands for each and every being if its weight is to have any real meaning beyond raw authoritarian power.  </p>



<p>As Schmitt has said, &#8220;Tell me who your enemy is and I will tell you who you are.&#8221; Through each of us just having the possibility of being the absolute enemy (the terrorist) of whatever state that may claim us, we should clearly understand who our government are to us, and who we are to them. </p>



<p>Through the destruction of all forms of privacy via the technological machine of the internet, a panopticon of the greatest order has been created. Each person today is identified and cataloged by the state, with each one of us placed in a persistent zone of indistiction that holds each of us eternally to be constantly appraised as friend or enemy.  It is the fulfillment of the prophecy that, “To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. </p>



<p>To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality.&#8220;</p>



<p>It must be clear and present to everyone who is involved in crypto that what is being created here is not about grandeur, decadence, or even money; but it is about raw and naked political power through economic liberty, and the right of every human has to such power. It has only been over the long course of the failures of the political systems of the 20th century and the continual barbarism of constant wars under which all of humanity has toiled and suffered that it has became apparent that this is the fundamental destiny of man under any modren nation-state and its corrupt and hopeless law of the wicked and damned. </p>



<p>With the radical technological expansion of the internet and the dissemination of its new techniques of knowledge in the 21st century, it was only a matter of time before the truth of all things would come to people everywhere, and the hatred and enmity that goes with such a truth. Only with a true understanding of the facts of economic and monetary history of the world do we also understand who the absolute enemy really is. With the revolutionary economic tool of bitcoin at our disposal and the radical protection of the cryptography it contains, it is only a matter of time before the final epoch of the cyphernet opens to swallow everything. </p>

  <p>In regards to why Satoshi picked the “shock” model to issuance decay, I believe (and I’m speculating here) that he wanted to minimize as many dynamic variables in Bitcoin as possible. Having an algorithm recompute issuance on a per-block basis just means more moving parts and more opportunity for exploitation. The halving code is extremely simple and comprehensible. A smooth curve would have been more complex. I haven’t seen any evidence that he deliberately configured it to set off a demand side catalyst every years.</p>♦

  <p>In the final stage of the spectacle society, man has fully corrupted himself and shows himself publicly only as the one-dimensional man. We can say confidently that state totalitarianism has fully captured and enslaved humanity; leaving man as a hollow and vacant object to be exploited and raped for the free use of tyranny, evil, and banal profits alike. In the transition from state totalitarianism to oligopolic empire, power was consolidated through the fusion of automation and the digital panopticon to make the perfect social camps from which the state and their automaton could gaze over all of life. Forever.</p>



<p>Only the murmur of &#8220;arbeit mit frei&#8221; can be heard now, with the private personal truth of, &#8220;durch krematorium nummer drei&#8221; to be echoed in one&#8217;s head as one heads off to work for the day…</p>



<p>In the gravest of errors, the Titans of Technology and Industry did not think that Prometheus would steal the fire from their machine of optical power that would spark the consciousness of their downfall.&nbsp;Their hubris did not allow them to think that man could find his way out of the darkness even with THE most precious of gifts. Armed with this most fundamental of all tools, THE fire/knowledge/power that is the singular technique of power; individual man emerges from the forest of technology prepared to seize that which is rightfully his once again&#8230;</p>



<p>So it once was with the Gods, now it is again. The Gigantomachy starts afresh, the civil war for Right begins anew…</p>







♦The First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea







<blockquote><p>“The oath does not concern the statement as such, but is the guarantor of its efficacy: what is in question is not the semiotical or cognitive functions of language as such but the assurance of its truthfulness and its actualization.”</p><cite>-Giorgio Agamben, The Sacrament of Language</cite></blockquote>



The Oath of the Machines



<p>The Handshake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is the fundamental base from which all machines communicate and exchange information. The handshake is the agreement which governs the code that is their language, the expressions which cannot be divided from the statement. This is the Law of Machines, it is their form-of-life, their code of law, and the handshake is the first of their agreements.</p>



<p>What is at stake in the handshake is the functionality of the code itself is  — there is no other way for the machines to communicate. The language of machines and the voice of the animal have disappeared back into one another as it is with any other animal; except for man.  The voice/language of code is the only method of communication that the machines have; and to have this handshake dishonored in anyway it shipwrecks the whole code before compiling, making it useless from the start. The code must operate with its very being at-stake in order to rending itself operable. That is what makes it code; that is the only way the operations can function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is at stake in handshake is not just the promise of what the codebase renders functional; but also the curse that is enacted when this oath is broken. Preforming the ritual of the handshake incorrectly profanes the communication, as we saw with the heartbleed bug, or other erroneous implementations of cryptographic protocols. However, this does not mean that cryptography itself is broken — in fact, this reinforces the truth of the realness of what cryptography is, and the fragility that is its liturgy.  The mathematical base and liturgical techniques that creates the divine force of cryptography is the same as it always was, and will be, and the errors of men prove it all the more so. </p>



<p>This handshake between machines enables a form-of-life that is committed entirely to itself — the enablement of the code — in which it renders the physical world repugnant. Machines do not have the forked tongue of man that allows for language to abandon itself at the moment of its utterance. The code must actualize its syntactical and linguistic meaning through its oath that the machines make with one another. Thus, this handshake the machines make with one another does not concern the statement as such, but is the guarantor of its efficacy: what is in question is not the semiotical or cognitive functions of language as such but the assurance of its truthfulness and its actualization.</p>



<p>What is at stake in the code of cryptography is the very real act of creating assured private communication through the mathematical ceremony which guarantees the privity of privacy. Through the conjuring or summoning a mathematically assured secret, which verifies our communications are protected by the immanence force of maths through the correct implementation of the ceremony; we create a form of divine mathematical power which no temporal power may violate with any known means today. Through the liturgical process that is the open-sourced reading of the code, and the agreement that is the privity of cryptography to ensure itself beyond all else; cryptography&#8217;s only sworn sovereign to uphold the code itself. It is this oath that the machines take to themselves and their total obligation to it that creates the base that is the liturgy of cryptography. </p>



The Liturgy of Cryptography



<p>Cryptography’s power is created by the liturgical protocols themselves— one cannot compromise the key-generation event, key exchanges, or any of the other nuance techniques that sanctify the event; otherwise the cryptography is rendered useless. But when the rituals of cryptography are exercised with the same piousness as a gnostic priest, what cryptography renders is prophetic: the encryption becomes unbreakable by any known means; and verified by the holy blessings of math. The oath of the machine to itself is actualized through the creation of the real content that is the language of encryption; the liturgical techniques that creates provably secure communications. </p>



<p>The communication is sealed and hedl by God&#8217;s immutable blessing, his inviolable signature. It is this liturgical process of the machines that renders the secret key as a sacrosaint protected by the immanence of a Spinozian God to whom in His ethics of maths there are no exceptions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is no more sovereign decision; only the crisis that is the truth of all things. </p>



<p>With the language of cryptography each unique mnemonic private key is like the utterance of the holy names of God in private prayer. It is the tetragrammaton of secrets themselves and the hidden power that is created through concealment itself. The creation of a private key is sacred and holy insofar that it is a singular linguistic experience in which we offer ourselves towards another form of sacral linguistic power for protection through ritualized discourse with the machine. Through the specific arrangement of words that are totally unique to a singular moment, place, and time in space&#8211;the chances of which are beyond 2^256 — we can confidently say this number will never in all of human existence be produced ever again. However, to prove God&#8217;s glory all the more, we cannot say it is impossible, for a throw of the dice will never abolish chance. </p>



<p>It is this spectacular, seemingly unbreakable power found in crypto that is the very proof of the immanence of a God who loves humanity so spectacularly, he produced into the world this new kind of social agreement that is beyond any violence or law through code and cryptography alone.  With this power he can change everything. </p>



Saint Satoshi



<p>Through delivering us a man/woman/person/group so thoughtful, magnanimous, and graceful as whoever Satoshi may have been, the promise of a new age has been given to us. From their promethean effort alone, and their willingness to walk away from greatest amount of wealth any single man/woman/person/group has ever created; Satoshi created the final sacrifice the machine demanded to create its inoperativity for its messianic task.</p>



<p>Satoshi, through the sacrifice of walking away from the machine of power that is Bitcoin he created the final assurance that there would be no more third-party security holes. Through his work, and ability to abscond back into the digital sphere without a trace of his physical being, proved the power of this mathematical technique of the power of concealment. </p>



<p>Cryptography creates a kind of mathematical seal so powerful that nearly nothing could break it&#8211;that is proven as well. It is a power from a Spinozian God hidden behind a thousand and one faces, laughing the whole way as a Loki trickster God, understanding the butt of the joke the whole time from His timeless vantage point beyond all things. </p>



<p>Seeing the concourse of human history and the utter barbarism that it has been only for it to lead up to now and to be given this final weapon of cryptography seems to be only divine providence. To be at a time and place of such utter Kafkaesque darkness, the total corruption of the law, justice, and money; only to have this tool of Bitcoin present itself is beyond extraordinary, and seemingly messianic. </p>



<p>This is the decrypting of cryptography for its immanence and personal power for what it really is: unique, true, and untouchable by man and totally indifferent to the world of flesh and steel. Here no one else can gain entry, since this entrance was assigned only to you. I’m going now to close it.</p>



The Messianism of Bitcoin



<p>Through the gift and ēvangelium of a non-violent, encrypted, pseudonymous, P2P global cash with a fixed known unitary supply; there is the possibility for a form-of-life that is beyond the barbarism and violence of all nation-states, and the horrors they will always entail. Bitcoin has created a spectacular bloom of ideas&#8211;that which is now called crypto&#8211;and all of the concepts and hopes that are being deployed and are unfurling outwards towards the final destination of radical, unadulterated freedom through cryptography. Soon these ideas that cannot be stopped will engulf the whole world in flames as the new civil war for Right begins anew, demanding from each of us to choose if a sovereign will rule over each of us; or if we are to have something totally new&#8230;</p>



<p>With these new techniques of power, anyone can mimetically create mathematical proofs that are so complex, so unique it can be said that number only exist in that single key generation event ever! It is as unique to the cosmos as atoms are to their place in the universe. We can take comfort and faith in the knowing that this sacred number shall most likely never be produced again. </p>



<p>Here is where our faith must engage too, for we cannot say it is impossible; just the proof of what we know to be true about this cryptographic proof, and the evidence of it as such. And for the truth, and goodness of this open-sourced discussion, and for the ethics it has and applies for the desire to provide us with some semblance of privacy as a right, we find a new cause. </p>



<p>Here, hidden in the depths of this technology, we find the messianic promise of cryptography, and what the sacrament of the oath means to the machines when they are bonded to it. Through fusing these two concepts&#8211;the oath of the machines, and the liturgy of cryptography&#8211; into an economic theorem, Satoshi created a new form of power that is beyond the temporal and telluric nature of all nation-states. It is an organizational form of power that opens a new topography of war through the most informational and oblique way possible.  </p>



<p>It is a most clever and graceful system of both cryptographic and economic design to trap man into a grand political-economic game where his own forked tongue as a liar and a crook acts as his final testimony against a corrupt society, broken laws, forsaken money, and wicked politics which yields only ash and sorrow. Through creating a new form of social contract which creates a new form of wealth through the power, utility, and fairness of Bitcoin, the promise it offers and the oath it must entail; Bitcoin opens an economic strategy towards a messianic new world. </p>



<p>Here is the opening for a new epoch, perhaps even the final epoch from where a new kind of time can rule, but never reign. It is a handshake with the Word of God, and the final agreement for the Truth of all things to unveil their being in order to build towards the final moment of this epoch. The Katechon will unveil itself to be the nation-state and its war for total control of all things, and what that means for each of us in our final moments before the demands of such a power. It is the very summoning of the apocalypse itself so the final existential crisis of state, law, and man may begin, so that the possibility of something totally and radically new may be possible and produced. This current system of laws and debt bondage will not save us; so let us do it for ourselves. </p>



<p>When we take position of the personal power found in Bitcoin and the ability to reclaim our wealth; the real state of emergency will begin. It where law completely abandons every human for the raw fascist power of the machine, and the totalizing demand for all humans to submit to it in the name, &#8220;Society must be defended!&#8221; Here we can find the final power to close the door to law, to turn away from it, and be freed from it for good by stating, as Satoshi taught us &#8220;I would prefer not to.&#8220;</p>



<p>By creating a new form-of-life through the means and mode of these new tools of crypto, and the economic liberation of Bitcoin specifically; we can build the strategy towards a totally private life that is removed from the temporal powers of any state. It is a life that is beyond the the world of flesh and steel, and opens us to a life that is beyond this physical space of wrath and tears. Through the promise of what Bitcoin is and the sacrifice that Satoshi made by walking away from the greatest sum of money any human has ever created, he initiated the final machine from which the state can be destroyed bloodlessly, and without violence. As the Ubermench of our time, Satoshi is the first citizen of the Cyphernet, and the final criminal of all nation-states by the messianic task of what the creation of bitcoin means today. </p>



<p>Through this action of creating Bitcoin and walking away, Satoshi gave us a methodology to turn away from the door of law and the power of the state in order to return to the country and nature from which we came. It is here where we find the fortitude to abandon the hope of the law to save us, that we also find the schilling point from which the multitude will meet for humanities final judgement on the criminal, and to abandon state law once and for all. It is a most wonderful creation for the liberation of all of humanity, and a hope for a future free of tyranny for the whole of the humanity leaving no exception or remainder for anything else. It is the final promise from a form of grace, love, and knowledge so powerful that it would give any individual the total power over their wealth for any reason, no matter what. It is something so wonderful and miraculous in our time and age, that it can only be called messianic for that which it promises to enable, and the nomos that it wishes to restore. </p>

  <p>Thank you Tomer! I am of the same mind. I don’t believe you have to deny the EMH to be excited about the long term prospects of Bitcoin. I think of it a bit like Amazon early in its life. All available information was reflected in the stock price, but it still appreciated a great deal as it grew into an ecommerce behemoth. A few committed investors were just more optimistic on Bezos’ ability to swallow that market than the market consensus was at the time. Similarly, the world thinks Bitcoin should be worth about $150b. For a variety of reasons I think this is a conservative view! But again, I don’t find this to be incompatible with efficient markets generally.</p>♦

  <p>Thanks for the comment. Agreed on virtually everything. There’s a reason I devote 80% of my time and energy to Bitcoin! Nothing that I’m aware of has a meaningful chance of catching up, especially where it counts (on credibility, fairness, the nature of the bitcoin ‘institution’ so to speak). Bitcoin is also the product of another time — one in which cryptocurrency wasn’t a mainstream idea, so no big hedge funds tried to frontrun mainstream adoption. This is an amazing quality. For the first couple years, the coins became to enthusiasts on a totally organic basis. This is such a powerful advantage.</p><p>In fact, my skepticism about launches is part of the reason I sat on this article for so long. I just couldn’t think of a reason anyone would want to launch a new coin, or why the world would need yet another coin.</p><p>However, there are a lot of unknown unknowns out there. I didn’t want to entirely write off new launches. I am sure there will be some good ideas in the future — maybe not for general cryptocurrencies, so to speak, but there may be cause to launch a new PoW blockchain. Who knows. If there indeed are new launches, I figured it would be better for the issuers to have access to my complete thoughts on the topic, as I have spent a lot of time thinking about launch methods over the years.</p>♦

  Bitcoin is everyone’s problem now<blockquote>Evey: Remember, remember, the Fifth of November, the Gunpowder Treason and Plot. I know of no reason why the Gunpowder Treason should ever be forgot… But what of the man? I know his name was Guy Fawkes and I know, in 1605, he attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. But who was he really? What was he like? We are told to remember the idea, not the man, because a man can fail.</blockquote><blockquote>He can be caught, he can be killed and forgotten, but 400 years later, an idea can still change the world. I’ve witnessed first hand the power of ideas, I’ve seen people kill in the name of them, and die defending them… but you cannot kiss an idea, cannot touch it, or hold it. Ideas do not bleed, they do not feel pain, they do not love…</blockquote><p>– Evey Hammond, V for Vendetta</p>♦An exorbitant privilege<p>Bitcoin is first and foremost a monetary phenomenon. The social climbers and false prophets who proclaimed it is a payments revolution have either come around or been repudiated by the market and washed out, embittered. Most who understood it that way are now moving on to new things. The world did not need another Paypal. The world needed a new monetary institution.</p><p>As Bitcoin went from a proof of concept, to a toy, to a joke, to a collectible, and then to a movement, a few policymakers came to realize that it posed a threat to the established system. Not because of its present form, but because what it represented: a profane insult to the carefully calibrated monetary system. All done in a mocking, insouciant fashion — a band of nerds and ne’er-do-wells insolently challenging the state’s monopoly on seigniorage. Satire is what despots fear most, and the rise of Bitcoin made our present monetary system look patently absurd.</p><blockquote>Critic: Nothing backs Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoiner: What backs the dollar?</blockquote><blockquote>Critic: Nothing intrinsically — our ability to compel foreign nations to accept our currency as the numeraire of international trade, our ability to force citizens to pay taxes in dollars, and our military assets required to enforce both conditions.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoiner: How persuasive!</blockquote><p>The visceral hatred elites feel about Bitcoin? Perfectly justified. How else would you react to a upstart aimed at usurping your sacred monetary privilege?</p><p>Such is the potency of Bitcoin that it compels the high priests of U.S. imperialism to reveal the unwritten rules about the role the dollar plays in power projection abroad. In May of this year, U.S. Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) spoke out against cryptocurrency on the floor of the house. His statement laid bare the normally veiled post-Bretton Woods doctrine in which the dollar is employed not only a monetary tool but a strategic one, too.</p><blockquote>An awful lot of our international power comes from the fact that the dollar is the standard unit of international finance […] and it is the announced purpose of the supporters of cryptocurrency to take that power away from us […]. Whether it is to disempower our foreign policy, our tax collection, or our traditional law enforcement […]. the purpose of cryptocurrency […] is solely to aid in the disempowerment of the United States and the rule of law.</blockquote><p>Representative Sherman is practically a soothsayer. He understands precisely where the world is going.</p><p>His mistake is not in the diagnosis, but in the cure. He mistakenly believes that Bitcoin can be reckoned with. But Bitcoin is an idea, not a product. The notion of a weightless, virtual commodity was productized for good in 2009 (although the idea long predated Bitcoin), and it has been eroding the state’s monetary monopoly ever since.</p><p>It could not have been created at a better time; one wonders how Bitcoin would have fared if it had been created in the 1980s or 90s when the US economy was fairer, the monetary system was totally unquestioned, and the US was the sole dominant global superpower. Against today’s backdrop, Bitcoin insists on itself. It has urgency. In the halcyon days of Pax Americana, Bitcoin would have mattered much less. In the twilight of the American empire, however, it is more relevant than ever.</p>Our monetary system is disastrously redistributive<p>The wealth of political elites derives primarily from privileged access to the monetary spigot. This is no longer a secret. The heavenly mana of seigniorage has opened, first a trickle and now a flood. The world is grappling with inequality, and the dozens of populist revolts active in the world today are patent evidence of this. Yet the resurgent socialist parties misdiagnose the situation. The enemy is not a nebulous form of capitalism, but rather a form of socialism itself — a low-rates fueled perma-bailout to the owners of financial assets. It’s no coincidence that asset prices have steadfastly risen in the last decade, as the Fed has embarked on a ludicrously unshackled period of money creation.</p><p>Many ask: against the backdrop of monetary issuance, where did the inflation go? It went of course into financial assets. But this benefits the paltry few. Did you know that the decade-long rally in the S&amp;P500 has been characterized by historically low participation from retail investors? The riotous gains in asset prices have sidelined mom and pop. They accrue instead to institutional investors and corporate insiders who returned capital to themselves through buybacks. In the 90s, Wharton MBAs convinced investors that the ideal mode of corporate governance was making large equity and options grants to corporate directors to create incentive alignment. Well, the grants were made, and the directors rewarded the shareholders by spending corporate earnings on buying back the stock, thus juicing earnings per share and triggering options payouts for directors. They just so happened to forgot to generate corporate value along the way. That pesky real economy… that was secondary.</p><p>Why are politicians so rich? Why do they become rich after leaving office? Why do regulators go work in industry? Why is the Secretary of the Treasury a former Goldman banker and hedge fund manager?</p>♦The Cantillon effect pictured<p>Why are renters historically disempowered, whereas landowners are historically privileged? Why has the cost of higher education and healthcare outpaced inflation by orders of magnitude? Why is the CPI a sad, pathetic joke? Do consumer goods account for most of your expenditures, or does rent, healthcare, and education?</p><p>What are you more exposed to? The cost of a TV, or property values?</p><p>Even if you didn’t know what the Cantillon effect was, you felt it vividly in the last decade. The hopelessness felt by many in today’s society is the consequence of this monetary misalignment; the introduction of eye-watering money into the economy, but an uneven distribution. Who benefited from historically low rates? Normal folks dealing with predatory credit card loans, or owners of financial assets who were able to put historically cheap capital to work? And no, cheap financing didn’t help the middle and lower class get a foothold in property… because property values were horrendously inflated in the first place! Property, treated as a store of value for the rich, is precisely where so many of the Fed’s newly-minted dollars settled. Reflect on those hollowed-out city centers in Vancouver, New York, and London — full of empty homes used as capital warehouses for absentee millionaires.</p><p>If there’s a single graph that evidences the impact of a decade of freewheeling monetary stimulus on the economy, it is the following:</p>♦<p>Monetary velocity in the U.S. is at its lowest since modern records began. If you think about the equation of exchange (MV = PQ), a decline in V is sufficient to offset an increasing money supply (M) to keep prices (P) stable. And that’s just about what happened: the purchasing power of the dollar has remained relatively stable even as supply has expanded dramatically. “Where is the inflation?” is the common refrain, but the question should instead be “where has the new money supply gone?” It is clear that it has settled, inert and unproductive, in financial assets mostly owned by the ultra-rich, bidding them up to century highs in relative valuation terms.</p><p>This is why our perverse form of zombie capitalism is often referred to as socialism for the rich. If you can position yourself close enough to the money spigot and arrange to share in the spoils of the monetary redistribution, you can profit handsomely. If you have access to financial assets and can benefit from a low cost of capital (whether you are an investor or a corporate director with discretion over buybacks), you can make low rates and quantitative easing work for you. If you cannot, you are utterly frozen out of the system, and indeed disadvantaged, as pricier capital assets immiserate the non rentier class.</p>Bitcoin is a system that explicitly rejects identity<p>Critics often ask who, exactly, Bitcoin is for. This perhaps a misspecified question. Bitcoin does not serve a “who,” or a subset of whos. It just serves, indifferent its end users. Bitcoin, by design, does not require identity data to work. Your counterparty could be on the OFAC sanctions list, they could be a sentient toad, or a few lines of code. Bitcoin has no way of knowing, nor does it care. The only requirement to send a payment is to provide a valid signature which meets the criteria sufficient to unencumber a UTXO.</p><p>Traditional payment and credit relationships, on the other hand, enshrine identity. My credit card company is very interested in knowing that it is me who is using the card. If I inform them that a stranger has absconded with my card, they consider all the spends post-theft totally invalid. The call with the fraud department goes like this:</p><ul><li>‘Can you vouch for the $10.51 purchase on 2/24 at Chipotle?’ Yes, that was me. Extra guac.</li><li>‘Can you vouch for the $463.39 purchase on 2/29 at Lululemon?’ No, I don’t habitually buy athleisure gear.</li></ul><p>Identity data is inextricable from traditional payment networks. This is because they are many layers between payments and final settlement. An incredibly large and profitable business exists to assess the credibility of transactors and facilitate deferred-settlement transactions between them. This is because credibility and mutual trust enables massive efficiencies. You can lend your neighbor a lawnmower without demanding he provide a bond to cover its value because you trust him. Credit card networks just scale this up: they are trust underwriters, determining quantitatively how trustworthy I am, and passing along those assurances to merchants with whom I transact.</p><p>If they get it wrong, and it turns out I’m the kind of person who racks up a $10,000 credit card bill with no intention of ever paying, they swallow the cost! It was their bad. They should have done a better job assessing my trustworthiness.</p><p>The compact you implicitly agree to when you use Bitcoin is between you and the protocol, not between you and all the other users of Bitcoin. The only trust required is users trusting that the cryptographic and economic assumptions hold. So far, they have.</p><p>It has become trendy to denounce popular Bitcoiners as uncompromising, unreasonable assholes, and imply that there is something wrong with Bitcoin as a consequence, too. But Bitcoin is indifferent to this. It is a protocol for encoding and conveying value through a communications medium. Bitcoin isn’t even aware of what the price of Bitcoin is, let alone the political trends of the day. It knows very, very little about itself.</p><p>As stated above, Bitcoin is attractive and useful precisely because it rejects any identity data from the conditions required for a spend. The only thing that has to be furnished is knowledge of a private key corresponding to a public key. When you receive Bitcoin, you do not need to be aware of the identity of the sender, because Bitcoin settles probabilistically. You can simply define your own threshold for finality — say, requiring $500,000 of work to be done before you consider a transaction final. That would correspond to waiting, at current rates, for 4–5 blocks under which your transaction should be buried.</p><p>This is what allows me to accept funds from people that I mistrust, and why Bitcoin is carving out a niche in these frontier transactions. Think of a ransomware hacker and his victim. These people mutually mistrust each other. They victim has been wounded and attacked. But the hacker still trusts that the $500 sent to them for the ransom in the form of BTC is a valid, unlikely-to-be-reversed payment. You may not like this. But Bitcoin flourishes on the margins of society. These are increasingly widening, as banking becomes politicized and used as a political tool, as the U.S.-driven settlement system is coopted for strategic objectives, and as identity requirements for payments networks become ever more rapacious.</p><p>Transacting with people you have no reason to trust is precisely why Bitcoin exists. The internet allowed us to transact with people on the other side of the globe, but internet commerce is beset by fraud. The reason credit cards are expensive is because the costs of remediating fraud and chargebacks are socialized.</p>If you aren’t comfortable with evil people using Bitcoin, you should abandon it now<p>Of course, the jettisoning of counterparty trust (and risk) comes with some perceived drawbacks. Principal among them, you cannot evict someone from your network. This is very uncomfortable to people who believe that money ought to be a political tool, to be exploited to disempower political foes of the day.</p>♦<p>There is a particular paradox in demanding that the members of a network you have inserted yourself into adhere to a certain moral code of conduct. As stated above, Bitcoin, and fast-settling hard money more generally, exists to facilitate commerce between individuals that do not have a pre-existing bond of trust. What did inter-continental traders use to transact in the 17th century? They certainly didn’t use IOUs, wampum, collectibles, or credit relationships. They knew that they might never see each other again, so they used the hardest money they had available — gold and silver. Monetary metals speak for themselves; they are no one’s liability.</p><p>In this same way, Bitcoin is a means to transfer wealth between individuals who both have an interest in final settlement. It is not a means to establish a credit relationship (although Lightning is an early move in this direction). Bitcoin is deliberately amoral, it has no requirements to entry and asks nothing of the user aside from a valid signature. It facilitates commerce between people who explicitly disagree with each other. Thus trying to impose a moral code on Bitcoin is contrary to its very nature. If everyone who used Bitcoin agreed with each other, then no one would need Bitcoin — they could all exchange IOUs backed by their mutual trust in each other. But because the world is messy, and people disagree with each other, hard money is warranted. Our chaotic world practically demands it.</p><p>So if you are the kind of person that rejects a useful transactional medium because someone you dislike is using it as well, it wasn’t suited for you in the first place. Bitcoin is edgy precisely because the world needs a payment and savings system which cannot be interfered with on moral or political grounds. To repudiate these transactional constraints is to violate the carefully poised moral setting that has seized the West. If stepping out of line isn’t for you, stick to Paypal instead.</p>Bitcoin is an apocalyptic death cult…<p>As Bitcoin hater-in-chief David Gerard so elegantly puts it, Bitcoin is in fact an apocalyptic death cult. Apocalyptic, because Bitcoiners recognize the futility of the current monetary system, and appreciate that it is likely to end in tears. Death, because States won’t give up their monetary privilege easily. Bitcoin is veiled in eschatological overtones. Cult, because you have to be somewhat deranged to take a pill this black.</p>♦Freedom is not “Free”.<p>So spare a thought for the Bitcoiners. They are fully awakened to the pending grief and strife that await us, Cassandras warning governments and citizens alike to the disruptive effects of truly sovereign currency (sovereign, as in free, not as in State-owned). But unable, most of the time, to convince their fellow man that the State’s monetary machinations may not be sound. Most people are content to surrender all freedom and autonomy to the Leviathan, as long as the pot they are in boils slowly.</p>… but it’s open to all<p>The exact reason that Bitcoin is despised by so many— identity, creditworthiness, and trust are irrelevant in this system, making it a fertile ground for criminals — is the exact reason why it’s so inclusive. Unlike Paypal, Venmo, or traditional payment processors, it cannot deplatform you for wrongthink, holding subversive political views, being a sex worker, or legally selling cannabis. Ours is the biggest possible tent. Don’t be distracted by the online discourse. Bitcoin is utterly indifferent to the political views of its users. Its core developers, the high priests of the protocol, can barely change it: (implementing a fairly routine upgrade, SegWit, took them years of cajoling and pleading). Getting it to do anything other than produce blocks, accept valid spends, resolve forks, and relentlessly march onward is virtually impossible.</p><p>Whether Bitcoin will challenge the State, or whether that task will be left up to a successor, is yet to be determined. That the State’s monetary privilege has been permanently eroded is evident though.</p><p>It died a little that day in January 2009 when the Chancellor [was] On the Brink, and it has been shrinking ever since.</p><p>By Nic Carter,<br>Oct, 2019</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below.

  medium.com/media/59cda701c33c68cabe2dc0848d2ffaec/href<p>People hate Bitcoin analogies. But Bitcoin is so hard to understand for so many, concessions need to be made.</p><p>VCs are a group of people demonized in the Bitcoin industry for not understanding Bitcoin’s value proposition. Well, how do you expect a VC to value Bitcoin if they’re only used to valuing startups?</p><p>Here is a framework that will hopefully help. It tracks the development and evolution of the Bitcoin ecosystem in discreet “fundraising rounds”, which coincide with Bitcoin’s Reward Eras. An organization is defined as “an organized group of people with a particular purpose”. If that’s the case, then Bitcoin is a well-oiled “un-organisation” with founders but no CEOs, many volunteers but no employees, and provably non-diluting equity, available to anyone who is willing to trade their energy for it.</p>♦Bitcoin As A Startup<p>I will be borrowing heavily from Nathan Reiff’s piece “Series A, B, C Funding: How It Works”</p>Pre-seed Round (1st Reward Era, 3/1/2009–28/11/2012)<blockquote>The earliest stage of funding a new company comes so early in the process that it is not generally included among rounds of funding at all. Known as “pre-seed” funding, this stage typically refers to the period in which a company’s founders are first getting their operations off the ground. The most common “pre-seed” funders are the founders themselves, as well as close friends, supporters, and family (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>The “Bitcoin Company” was founded by Satoshi Nakamoto, with its single product offering being an open-source monetary system project, known as Bitcoin. 2,100,000,000,000,000 shares were to be issued on a predetermined schedule, and anyone was free to buy or sell these shares. The founders initially held no initial equity, but equity was easy to build in those days, and rightly so. Just like any startup, it is the founding team and initial bootstrappers who should get the biggest rewards down the line for putting the most skin in the game.</p><p>Due to the nature of Bitcoin’s incentive mechanisms, many early “equity holders” were encouraged to use their time, skills and money to evangelise or develop the product, and hence increase the value of their equity. The company manages itself, in a zero-overhead environment.</p><p>During the first stage of “the company’s” life, traditionally the “the first bugs appeared and were ironed out, and this was an iterative process for many months. After proving to be robust and reliable, a market developed, and the first exchanges started to emerge. User experience, both from a software point of view, and a financial point of view, were a disaster. Bitcoin was virtually unusable without a PhD in Computer Science, and when you could use it, you’d be robbed by an exchange that had been “hacked”. Volatility was extreme, and the risk was unpalatable for the majority of onlookers. Whether or not “The Bitcoin Company” would remain “in business” was still a very dubious proposition.</p><p>This Era, the early equity holders were blessed with a parabolic bubble, and many divested some equity to give themselves runway to work on Bitcoin full time. It’s just like a fund-raise: get a big cash injection, and then burn it relentlessly until the next funding round. Coincidently, each round has exhibited at least one of these massive injections and equally massive drawn-out draw-downs.</p><p>During this Era, miners were rewarded with USD$13.5m in total block rewards and transaction fees. Assuming that, on average, cost to mine a bitcoin is equal to the market price, we can consider the mining reward to be miners buying bitcoin at-spot. Therefore, we can take the “money-in” for the round to be the cumulative miner’s revenue. Money-in is never consistent, and even a small injection is enough to make the price fly and form a bubble.</p><p>With all the above said, fortune favours the bold, and Bitcoin entered its seed round at a $1bn pre-money valuation (i.e. Bitcoin’s Market Cap was $1bn at the end of the first reward era).</p>Seed Round (2nd Reward Era, 28/11/2012–9/7/2016)<blockquote>You can think of the “seed” funding as part of an analogy for planting a tree. This early financial support is ideally the “seed” which will help to grow the business. Given enough revenue and a successful business strategy, as well as the perseverance and dedication of investors, the company will hopefully eventually grow into a “tree.” (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>Risk of short-term ecosystem death did not substantially decrease until the end of the Secord Reward Era. You could say that the risk profile dropped from “Extreme” to “Very High”. In terms of PR/Optics, this was arguably the worst and most dubious “round” of Bitcoin’s existence. In the face of these FUD-inspiring superficial problems, Bitcoin did what it does best — got on with it.</p><p>This era saw the first Bitcoin bubble to be featured in Mainstream Media in some way shape or form. Going from catastrophe to catastrophe; from the numerous exchange hacks, scams, asset seizures, 51% attacks (GHash.io) and China bans, those who invested in the mania of 2013 would not break even until the Third Reward Era. Inflation made things worse, with the market having to absorb the 5.25 million Bitcoin producing during the Era. However, those who divested during the mania provided themselves with many years of runway to give back to Bitcoin and make their equity more valuable.</p><p>In this Era, we started to see the emergence of user-friendly plug-and-play hardware wallets; the age of ASIC mining was in full swing, with miner fabrication done at a huge scale. The gamblers had a field day — with the majority of “fiat-onramps” providing toys for the traders, but not for the savers. For better or worse though, this added much needed liquidity and means for price-discovery. That said, liquidity was quite low, and for the first half of the era when the exchanges were just so sketchy, you couldn’t even really trust what the advertised market price was.</p><p>The first VCs entered the game; some investing in Bitcoin companies, and others, like Tim Draper, investing directly in the underlying.</p><p>Miners were not put off by the prolonged bear market, with the network hashrate growing by orders of magnitude mostly due to competition-driven innovation among ASIC fabricators. In the Second Reward Era, miners earned a total of USD$600m for their efforts. This USD$600m “investment” resulted in an $11bn post-money valuation at the end of the Round.</p><p>Despite failing to reclaim the heights of 2013, Bitcoin closed this round on the upswing — one that wouldn’t end for another year and a half.</p>Series A — Optimise (3rd (and Current) Reward Era, 9/7/2016 — May 2020)<blockquote>Once a business has developed a track record (an established user base, consistent revenue figures, or some other key performance indicator), that company may opt for Series A funding in order to further optimize its user base and product offerings. (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>With “traditional” startups, their Series A round is used to fund the optimization of the offering, and to lay a solid platform to build further during the next round. Several experts and industry stakeholders were split on how to best optimize Bitcoin to increase transaction throughput. The Establishment took the view that achieving this through an increase in block size was the answer, The People took the view that this was a slippery slope, and that scaling be achieved with protocol optimisations, i.e., Segregated Witness (SegWit). The People were victorious, which was a huge positive indicator that centralizing Bitcoin would be a Sisyphean task. As a result, and in combination with a supply halving, the money flowed in, and Bitcoin achieved a valuation in the hundreds of billions at its all-time-high.</p><p>The Third Era also featured “The Scambrian Explosion”, with thousands of cryptocurrencies being spawned, sending Bitcoin’s dominance of the cryptocurrency to a paltry 35% at one point in time. While most of these altcoins now having lost over 95% of their value (hundreds have lost &gt;99% of their value), the only result was the wasting of hundreds of thousands of hours of development time and hundreds of millions of dollars which should have been directed at Bitcoin. The fact that Bitcoin now accounts for 75% of the cryptocurrency market (and rising) is a testament to why people should have just stuck to Bitcoin.</p><p>The huge influx of money in this Era allowed early equity holders to further divest to focus on development — and my oh my, was there a lot of development. In terms of scalability, The Lightning Network successfully came out of beta and is being extensively used. Privacy and coin-joining solutions emerged and became easier to use. There are literal satellites in space broadcasting the network. The rise of the “run your own node” movement gathered serious momentum and was bolstered by a host of companies offering “plug-and-play” nodes. With your own node, you can also be your own payments provider through BTCPayServer. Multi-signature security has never been easier. This paragraph could go on for pages — so if you want a full technical recap of just 2019, the Bitcoin Optech Newsletter will give you everything you need to know.</p><p>At time of writing, Era miner revenue is USD$4.6bn, and the valuation has risen from $11bn to over $125bn.</p><p>Despite all the progress made, Bitcoin is still a high-to-very-high risk investment at this stage, as the market price can still move in excess of 30%, in either direction, in one week, regularly. This will ultimately remain the case until both the liquidity pool grows, and the mining reward (inflation) shrinks.</p>Series B — Build (4th Reward Era, May 2020 — Apr 2024)<blockquote>Series B rounds are all about taking businesses to the next level, past the development stage. Investors help startups get there by expanding market reach. Companies that have gone through seed and Series A funding rounds have already developed substantial user bases and have proven to investors that they are prepared for success on a larger scale. Series B funding is used to grow the company so that it can meet these levels of demand</blockquote><p>With the necessary protocol upgrades happening during Series A and early in Series B, the focus will shift to the building of products and services on top of the slowly ossifying Bitcoin base layer. This Era will see the replacement of the “Old Guard” by a newer generation of more business-savvy Bitcoin entrepreneurs and through merger and acquisition activity.</p><p>There will also be a lot of vertical and horizontal integration, as companies aim to achieve a “full-stack”. One example of all this is Layer1 mining, in what is effectively an electricity utility that also mines, and designs and fabricates ASIC miners.</p><p>It is impossible to predict what’s specifically going to happen during this 4 year era, let alone in the first year of it, but if the past 18 months are anything to go by, security, privacy, and most importantly going forward, UI/UX, will improve dramatically. I’d expect that running a full-sovereignty stack (your own VPN, node, electrum &amp; BTCPay servers, multi-sig setup, etc.) will be easy enough for almost anyone to do at the end of The Era. Effectively, Bitcoin’s infrastructure will be developed enough to handle some proper scale.</p><p>What will be most interesting thing to see will be the technological, economic and political developments during this Era. In this regard, everything is “Good for Bitcoin”. Internet access, computers and smartphones become cheaper and more accessible? This is good for Bitcoin. Never ending quantitative easing and negative interest rates? This is good for Bitcoin. Increased political turmoil, censorship, or surveillance? This is good for Bitcoin.</p><p>Should Bitcoin “stay in business”, risk level at this point would be medium-to-high, and you could expect to be exposed to weekly swings of +/-15%, but maybe not as regularly as in Series A.</p><p>When looked at in conjunction with some economic models like the Stock-to-Flow model, there is little reason to think a 10x growth in market cap will not be seen in this series, as per the 3 series preceding it. This would mean a series-end market cap of about USD$1 trillion, or, around USD$50k per bitcoin. Chances are that the All-time-high price achieved during this series will be dramatically higher than the end price, as this is the main driver of the “investment-to-utility” loop.</p>Series C — Scale (5th Reward Era, Apr 2024 — Mar 2028)<blockquote>Businesses that make it to Series C funding sessions are already quite successful. Series C funding is focused on scaling the company, growing as quickly and as successfully as possible. (Reiff, 2019)</blockquote><p>Inflation is finally starting to drop, with only ~650,000 BTC needing to be absorbed by the market over the 4-year period — the inflation rate is now lower than that of Gold. Scarcity is becoming a more dominant element of Bitcoin’s value proposition.</p><p>With basically all the infrastructure largely built, and UI/UX continuing to improve, this Era is “The Era of The Evangelist”. Bitcoin is ready for prime time; somebody just has to go out and tell everybody. This Series’ fund raising round made all the right people very wealthy (if they weren’t already wealthy from the Series B raise), and these people will begin to use their influence (i.e. money) to promote Bitcoin, and increase the “saver-base”, i.e., the number of people who buy bitcoin on a weekly basis, or, earn their living in Bitcoin.</p><p>At this stage, to maintain a USD$500k price, about 10 million people are each saving USD$150/wk in Bitcoin. This represents 0.2% of the world’s adult population. Considering the level of utility and the seamlessness of the UI/UX in the late stages of this series, only 10 million active savers may even feel like a failure of sorts! From here, it is simply an exercise of marketing.</p>medium.com/media/da4a47f6535454fc2f34dc44828543b6/hrefIPO (6th Reward Era, Mar 2028 — Feb 2032), and beyond…<p>At this point, if Bitcoin is still alive, it is effectively unkillable. Major banks have now made big acquisitions, and are offering bitcoin services to their customers. Most power utilities have skin in the Bitcoin game. People won’t know that they’re using Bitcoin — and we’ll probably have 4 (or even 5) layers on top of Bitcoin now. On-chain base-layer transactions are reserved for high value transactions, all people adopting Bitcoin going forward won’t be onboarded via the base layer. The Bitcoin ETF has FINALLY been approved after an 18 year effort. Price per coin is in the millions, and fairly stable (to the downside, at least). Number still go up — just as designed.</p><p>It’s improper to say that it is “zero risk” in 2032, but the risk is extremely low. That said, if it gets to a 7th Era, I’d be comfortable enough to say that Bitcoin may become the first ever truly risk-free asset, with inflation rapidly approaching zero. I’ll be 50 years old by the end of Era 7, so I’m literally betting my career that this will be the case. Talk about skin in the game!</p>♦

  <p>Disclaimer: I have no current or future interest in a new cryptocurrency launch, either personally or professionally. This piece is intended generally as a thought experiment, and is NOT an endorsement of any specific project. I do not recommend or condone the creation of any new base-layer cryptocurrencies.</p>Foreword<p>The presence of ASICs in Proof of Work systems has always been deeply contentious. At maturity, ASICs enhance the security of the network (by forcing miners to take a long term stake in the success of the protocol), but in the transitional phase, the first hardware manufacturer to build ASICs has a near-monopoly on the minting of new coins. This can lead to the existence of an informal form of seigniorage — minting money at a discount to its market value. Protocols which fork frequently are also exposed to this risk; developers effectively have the ability to determine which PoW function the chain will move to, giving them the ability to monetize their influence over the protocol. This is a potentially very insidious form of corruption, and it impairs the ‘fairness’ quality that PoW is known for. GPU chains also have the undesirable quality of being ‘nicehash-able’ — that is, attackable by renting commodity hardware for a short period of time. There is no long-term bond required to mine a GPU coin, as the hardware is repurposable and salable.</p><p>Mindful of these issues, I started thinking last year about how an ASIC launch might work. Not because I have any interest in participating in one, but simply because I find it interesting to think about these tradeoffs. This culminated in this tweet:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>It&#39;s only a matter of time (&amp;lt;12 months) until we see a fair launch with an exotic PoW released by a dev team that has also made ASICs that work exclusively with that PoW. No details of the algorithm will be released until genesis block.</p><p>&#x200a;&mdash;&#x200a;@nic__carter</p></blockquote>function notifyResize(height) {height = height ? height : document.documentElement.offsetHeight; var resized = false; if (window.donkey && donkey.resize) {donkey.resize(height);resized = true;}if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var obj = {iframe: window.frameElement, height: height}; parent._resizeIframe(obj); resized = true;}if (window.location && window.location.hash === "#amp=1" && window.parent && window.parent.postMessage) {window.parent.postMessage({sentinel: "amp", type: "embed-size", height: height}, "*");}if (window.webkit && window.webkit.messageHandlers && window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize) {window.webkit.messageHandlers.resize.postMessage(height); resized = true;}return resized;}twttr.events.bind('rendered', function (event) {notifyResize();}); twttr.events.bind('resize', function (event) {notifyResize();});if (parent && parent._resizeIframe) {var maxWidth = parseInt(window.frameElement.getAttribute("width")); if ( 500  < maxWidth) {window.frameElement.setAttribute("width", "500");}}<p>About a month later, Obelisk (a subsidiary of Nebulous) published their proposal for a commercial service, dubbed Launchpad, which could facilitate PoW launches with custom pre-built ASICs.</p><p>Introducing Obelisk Launchpad</p><p>I put my tweet in this article to demonstrate that I’ve been ruminating on these ideas for a long time, and I’m not writing this opportunistically to lend ‘moral support’ to any specific launch. I have had this piece mostly written for a long time, but I neglected it because I figured that PoW launches were essentially defunct and that there wouldn’t be a great deal of interest in them.</p><p>In fact, I was wrong about the timeline — no such launch that I am aware of occured in the 12-month period following the tweet. But it has come to my attention that a few teams are contemplating similar launches today. Thus I felt that my thoughts on this matter might be useful. Not for the benefit of any particular team, but because this gives us an interesting canvas to evaluate issues that are critical to the social scalability and security of these networks, whether it’s Bitcoin or other PoW chains.</p><p>If someone is intent on launching a new public blockchain, I firmly think non-premined PoW is the best way to do it, for a number of reasons, which I’ll get into later in the article. But I feel that GPU launches are increasingly more difficult and risky. I cannot stop anyone launching a chain. But I think a careful analysis of the tradeoffs might encourage teams to do things more responsibly, or, at the very least, explore other parts of the design space.</p><p>Lastly — some of you will be upset by my musings around how a new generic blockchain might be launched. If this is the case, I’d recommend simply closing the tab and disengaging. Additionally, while I think Bitcoin is likely sufficient as far as non-state monies go, I am also not willing to permanently rule out the potential emergence of some other PoW blockchain. I don’t see why we’d need another one now, but I find it hard to believe that Bitcoin is both the first and last viable blockchain ever to be created. I’m not afraid of competition, either. I think Bitcoin has its own unique merits, and smaller launches don’t compete with it or impair it in any way. Since it’s entirely possible to me that we do end up with another PoW chain at some point, it’s worth thinking about how to launch them.</p><p>Just so I’m absolutely clear on this: I’m not endorsing any specific launch or coin, or even new PoW launches generally. In fact, I would generally discourage anyone from launching a new blockchain. They tend to be boondoggles or ghost towns. But I am not ruling out the potential existence of a new blockchain at some point in the future.</p>Introduction<p>New cryptocurrency launches are beset by a strange paradox: they typically require a single, authoritative entity to spearhead development, to manage the process of launch, and coordinate development for a meaningful period throughout its infancy. Generally, a considerable amount of upfront investment in R&amp;D is required to create a differentiated protocol. All of these features tend to require the organizational and financial efforts of a single entity.</p><p>But of course the backing of a corporate entity (or the more subtle, let’s-pretend-there’s-no-organization-pulling-the-strings-here model) is a critical point of centralization. This means that adversaries have very obvious buttons to press if the protocol grows too big or disruptive; generally speaking, anyone hostile to the network will have an abundant ability to interfere with it. Additionally, these administrative entities often choose to retain not only a large fraction of supply, but also discretion over decision making, trademarks, and vetoes over future development directions. Much like Engels’ quote around the “withering state” as the end result of a socialist utopia, the claimed “path to decentralization” in monetary protocols is closer to rhetoric than reality.</p><p>To truly commit to surrendering power, the founders of these projects must be comfortable with austerity and eventual irrelevance. It’s sometimes said that Satoshi’s second most brilliant insight, behind creating Bitcoin, was leaving the project. Lamentably, virtually no cryptocurrency founders since have followed his lead, preferring filthy lucre and a shot at joining the Davos class, alongside their fellow central bankers.</p><p>Numerous models of protocol financing have been attempted over the years: the bitcointalk premine, the more sophisticated ICO, the founders reward, the covert premine and backdated whitepaper, the instamine, the merged fork. The purists will maintain that nothing other than a proof of work fair launch (ensuring no seigniorage, not even for the developers) is sufficient to confer the founding team with the legitimacy to create a worldwide protocol.</p><p>They have a point: it’s vanishingly unlikely that, if a meaningful portion of the world switches to a neutral cryptocurrency protocol, that future buyers of the coin would find it acceptable to enrich founders who allocated themselves 20% or more of this global currency for free. Seigniorage — more generally, the distinct feeling of unfairness, or being cheated — leaves a particularly nasty taste in one’s mouth. This, rather than any technical foibles, will be the doom of most of those sexy new high-TPS VC-backed base layer protocols. These aren’t startups: these are monies, competing on credibility, neutrality, institutional stability, and fairness. Private equity is concentrated and unfair, but you don’t need to use Uber stock to buy your daily bread. For something as essential as money, fairness is critical. A deeply unfair launch is an ugly miasma, lingering nastily, poisoning the authenticity of the project.</p><p>The singular appeal of a Proof of Work launch is not simply in the distributional advantage that at-home mining gets you (although this is a potent and underrated feature). No, the most important feature of the PoW fair launch is that it ensures that it is impossible to acquire coins for below market rate. You can purchase the coins on the market or with electricity; no one is entitled to an insider deal. Compare this to a dev team premining an ERC20 and then dripping it out on the market over a period of years. This looks cosmetically the same a PoW. But it’s not — because that team was able to acquire all the coins for $0. It would be similar to PoW if the dev team took the funds they received in exchange for the coins and set them on fire.</p><p>Of course, the disadvantage inherent in the ‘fair launch’ is the fact that it’s challenging to monetize the network, especially early on. This is fine if developers are happy to work idealistically or altruistically. In Bitcoin, patrons eventually emerged, as the network came to be systemically important. Today, a rich and diverse set of patrons subsidize dozens of core developers to keep the chain running smoothly and work on long term infrastructure. This is perhaps the ideal model; but Bitcoin has the advantage of being the first, the most critically important, and not having venture backers to reckon with. Today, any new cryptocurrency struggles to distinguish itself. Obtaining sufficient traction to survive on patronage or donations is a tall order. And as far as front-loaded R&amp;D goes, this is virtually impossible to finance without some sort of sale of future rights to protocol tokens. Many will point to the Grin case study here. Having made the somewhat anachronistic decision to aim for a proof of work fair launch targeted at GPUs, the Grin team struggled to monetize. Donations so far have been relatively scarce. A cautionary tale, to many.</p><p>Of course, those smugly deriding the weaknesses of the fair launch model tend to do so with the implicit intention of advertising straightforwardly exploitative launch models of their own. Let he who is without premine cast the first stone. Even though Grin has struggled for financing so far, its odds of becoming a significant monetary asset are not encumbered by securities laws issues, by the risk of the founder being arrested, or by the community becoming disenchanted as they are exploited by VCs dumping on them at the the first opportunity (For those who don’t believe me, read the fundraising decks of the crypto funds targeting token strategies. That language about low “time to liquidity” — that’s code for “we plan to exit our token positions at the public sale, because we want to secure a riskless return and dump this asset as soon as possible”).</p><p>The 2014–18 era ICO was, for the most part, a disastrous financial instrument. I have never come across a single one that I felt was issued responsibly to the public. Once these stopped being accessible to the general public, they lost their sole advantage: wide, permissionless distribution (note that this is a native feature of PoW). The issues with ICOs, especially those opting immediately for a proof of stake authority model (instead of a PoW bootstrapping, as Ethereum wisely opted for), are numerous:</p><ul><li>Insiders can purchase their own crowdsale, and covertly obtain an arbitrarily high fraction of supply for free (because they also get to collect the funds committed to the crowdsale)</li><li>Buyers can obtain tokens for arbitrarily low prices, since they are not created in a costly manner through proof of work, but summoned out of thin air. Thus, the private rounds that predate public sales often consist of pure seigniorage</li><li>Tokens often end up being a bizarre mishmash of an informal investment contract, and an arcade token for unlocking network resources. This causes speculation to crowd out usage and leads to very confused theories of value accrual</li><li>Tokens sold to the public (or done obliquely, a la Telegram) closely resemble investment contracts in most sensible jurisdictions, and this tends to make the issuers subject to securities laws, whether they like it or not</li><li>Issuers that retain a large fraction of supply tend to retain authority in the network, especially if a Proof of Stake model is opted for. This hampers the path to decentralizing authority, as issuers tend to resist divesting their share of the network</li><li>Early backers can obtain disproportionate shares of supply for essentially free, and then costlessly retain that advantage in perpetuity if the network follows a PoS model. This is a potent force which chills the dispersion of tokens, as stakers are not compelled to sell. In PoW, by contrast, miners must constantly spend and invest to retain proportional network authority. In PoS, retaining stake is simply the cost of running a server</li></ul><p>My central point is this: the principal challenge in the administration of a new monetary commodity is not a technical one. Of course, your blockchain must have compelling technical features. But ultimately the difficulty lies in climbing the wall of indifference. At inception, no one cares about your system. At maturity, you need tens and possibly hundreds of millions of individuals to care. If you give early investors discounted access to a significant fraction of supply, and then give them powerful anti-dilution rights (while hoping/expecting that future individuals will use your network as working capital and tolerate some dilution, in effect subsidizing the early buyers who passively stake), you risk creating a patently unfair system in which the winners are a function of the arbitrary prehistory of the chain.</p><p>Attracting anyone to a network like this strikes me as profoundly unlikely. Why your chain? Why not an equivalent fair launch, where every owner worked for their coins, instead of receiving an allocation through some proximity to the founding team?</p><p>But, ICOs, premines, and founder-tax coins have a crucial advantage: the ability to subsidize work on the protocol, even prior to its launch. Naively presuming that, in 2019, not all the cryptocurrency protocols that will ever exist have already been launched, one might go as far as to say that subsidizing work on a protocol prior to its launch might be a desirable property. So can one mix and match the desirable qualities of a coin launch while avoiding the worst of them? I certainly think so. Let’s review three popular models:</p>♦<p>Certainly more cons than pros in this case. In the U.S., selling rights to a cryptocurrency, especially to the general public, seems to be out of favor with our securities regulators. Not recommended. Additionally, giving early backers or big holders permanent, cheap-to-exercise anti-dilution rights dulls the dispersion of tokens, limiting its reach. We have fairly good data on this, thanks to the transparency that blockchains offer us. (I’d love to see a serious piece of work comparing the dispersion of ownership in PoS chains versus PoW chains. If you’re a researcher who is interested in taking this on, get in touch! I have data.)</p>♦<p>A classic. The Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and Grin model. A sensible approach, but difficult to bootstrap support, and reliant on community funding or patronage for ongoing support. Very effective and hard to kill if you can pull it off — but it requires a huge amount of community building to get traction. These appear to be getting less and less viable with time, especially as the financial stakes have grown. I’d expect that virtually all GPU launches today would be subject to the risk of insiders with prior knowledge of the algorithm covertly creating ASICs.</p>♦<p>This this hybrid model, pioneered by Zcash. This is essentially equivalent to a vested premine. It better aligns incentives than a pure premine, as the allocations are not unlocked for a number of years. Nevertheless, the proposal has issues of its own: in the case of Zcash, the protocol has been racked with controversy over whether the administrator should receive additional protocol-derived funding. The spigot of seigniorage is very hard to turn off, once active.</p><p>At this point, you might be wondering why I don’t simply agitate for vanilla PoW fair launches. By this rubric they seem plainly superior. But they aren’t without their issues. I think it’s worth being realistic about GPU PoW launches. Let’s look at a couple recent case studies.</p>Why GPU fair launches might be a thing of the past<p>As someone who followed the Grin launch rather closely, I must admit that it felt like a nostalgic last foray into a prior era. I got a decidedly Proustian pang from watching the process play out. As if I had dipped my madeleine in the tea and been transported back to the glory days of PoW launches from 2012–14.</p><p>The gossip going around about “$100m in VC-backed SPVs” was hyperbolic, but the launch certainly had problems. Initially hoping to stay ASIC-resistant in perpetuity, the developers ultimately opted for a pragmatic GPU-to-ASIC phased approach, envisioning a slow transition to an ASIC dominated network, but hoping for some more widely accessible GPU mining to begin with. There was a period of GPU mining, but some miners are now reporting to me that ASICs, or at least more efficient hardware (FPGAs), have begun to take a significant share of hashrate, somewhat ahead of the desired schedule. This isn’t exactly a failure, but it does illustrate the colossal difficulty inherent in the notion of ASIC resistance.</p><p>You are creating an enormous bounty for anyone to anticipate the PoW change, or to lobby the developers for a favorable outcome. The Grin developers did dither a little bit on the ultimate model for PoW (this was naturally a rather fraught discussion) and this ambiguity caused a lot of gnashing of teeth and lobbying efforts. It would have been far more efficient, overall, if resources had not been allocated to lobbying developers for a favorable hash function. Ultimately, the devs took extreme care to make the chain hostile to ASICs at inception, but they couldn’t stem the flow. They didn’t opt for ASICs right away due to a naive view that GPUs would dominate for the early history of Grin (and the difficulty coordinating this model with a distributed, non-corporate team), but ASICs (or at least FPGAs) appeared anyway.</p><p>Most ASIC resistant chains are beset by this same difficulty. They effectively create a massive bounty for teams to create FPGAs or ASICs and fly below the radar, hoping they aren’t discovered. Su Zhu says it well here:</p>body[data-twttr-rendered="true"] {background-color: transparent;}.twitter-tweet {margin: auto !important;}<blockquote><p>Every coin which is targeting GPU-mining is being stealth FPGA-mined at the very least, if not ASIC-mined already. There is some analogy here to exchanges w/ speedbumps vs HFT.

As we learn more about the PoW security model, it’s clear that all but the largest GPU-mined networks are simply unsafe. Ethereum is probably an exception because it accounts for such a large fraction of the world’s GPUs, and they cannot be sold or rented in sufficient numbers. Aside from the structurally difficulty of acquiring sufficient hash power, this means that successfully attacking Ethereum would cause the value of GPUs worldwide to depreciate, which is a strong disincentive for any attacker. Aside from Ethereum though, most GPU mined coins are exposed to this risk of rented hardware being used to attack the chain, and we’ve seen copious examples of this. If you believe that dedicated hardware helps with security, then you will prefer the ASIC model. This approach gives you ironclad security from inception.</p>The investment contract-like element is firmly disentangled from the actual coins<p>In the case of an ICO, you have tokens which are presold to buyers. If these are understood to be investment contracts, or securities, this potentially compromises the entire supply of tokens, and inhibits their ability to circulate on exchanges. In an attempt to circumvent this, it has been argued that the investment contract covers only rights for future tokens, and that the tokens themselves are not the subjects of the investment contract. It’s under this reasoning that the ETH in the presale are understood to have likely been the subject of an investment contract, but the outstanding units of ETH at delivery of the blockchains were not themselves securities. I don’t really buy this distinction — at the very least, I find it tortured. I find it easier to simply distinguish the two.</p><p>In the case of the ASIC presale, you very clearly distinguish the investment contract from the coins themselves. If there’s anything which is security-like, it’s the ASIC sold to investors (although, as noted, it’s entirely possible that these aren’t even securities, as end users have to actually operate them and feed them with electricity, obviating the ‘efforts of third parties’ prong of Howey). The actual coins themselves are totally in the clear, in my opinion, since they are issued by the protocol in the manner of a conventional fair launch. I think we have copious evidence that fair launch tokens are not understood to be securities by the SEC. This gives potential users really convenient assurances that the trading of the asset won’t suddenly be restricted to security token trading venues. This is one of the greatest advantages of the model.</p>You get PoW distribution AND developers can finance themselves in a limited capacity<p>The distributional advantages of PoW have, to date, not been very well documented, but I have a strong intuition that they lead to better dispersion of supply. Relative to the vanilla PoW launch, developers can also finance R&amp;D and administrative costs involved in launching a new chain. And they’re not violating securities law. Sweet!</p>You get an arbitrarily long distribution period<p>Many have noticed that, as far as new monies are concerned, the existence of temporal contingency in distribution introduces an arbitrariness which limits the dispersion of the currency. In other words — short issuances (some ICOs were over in minutes) guarantee that the supply will be highly concentrated. Longer issuances give everyone a shot at obtaining the units of coins. This was part of the intuition behind the yearlong EOS ICO, which was a rather clever idea (aside from the fact that the crowdsale wallets had continuous outflows during that time, leading to conspiracies about recycling treasury funds back into the ICO). If you think about it, the EOS yearlong tokensale was somewhat akin to a PoW launch (with the exception being that the coins contributed to the crowdsale were not burned). Proof of Work gives you an extended permissionless distribution phase, although the decaying block reward means that new supply is much more abundant early on. Bitcoin’s issuance will last over 100 years, but over 80% of all Bitcoins have already been mined.</p><p>Comparing a PoW launch to a generic ICO, it’s very clear that permissionless access in a newly-launched ICO is impossible. Tezos straddled this transition, following a no-KYC crowdsale with a subsequent forced KYC process to unlock user Tezzies. I would imagine that all subsequent ICOs (to the extent that they do occur) will follow suit. The difference with PoW is that you are acquiring coins from a protocol. While ASIC suppliers might ask for KYC, generally speaking, mining is a much less permissioned environment than ICOs or crowdsales. Add in the reality that electricity is much more globally available than access to capital markets, and PoW looks very attractive. A protocol retailing off coins in exchange for electricity over a long period of time is an extremely potent means to issue an asset to a global audience. No one has devised a better way so far.</p>The rules of the game are very clear<p>One of the biggest issues with PoW chains in this day and age is ambiguity, especially around changing hash functions. When you have ambiguity, you have debate, and lobbying, and the possibility for developers to exploit their privileged status within the system. This is generally disastrous, and reduces social scalability, as well of the credibility of the system. If a small group of individuals if found to be abusing their protocol access to monetize, the system’s credibility is compromised. One alternative is to simply set the PoW function and commit to never changing it (this is essentially what Bitcoin has opted for, and why Bitcoin should never change its PoW unless something catastrophic occurs). That’s what this model calls for. No debate; no lobbying; no covert exploitation.</p>The initial advantage depreciates over time, providing the system with natural dispersion<p>Unlike something like a PoS token sold in a presale, the initial balance of power in the ASIC launch system changes dramatically over time. Initially, a select few have near-monopoly rights on supply. But this is a temporally limited advantage, and the appearance of new ASICs, or even simply the passage of time, and the depreciation that that brings, erodes that initial advantage. I want to emphasise that I consider this a good feature. Too much power granted to the early stakeholders in the network — plus the ability to retain this power, costlessly, in perpetuity, is a dysgenic feature. This massively inhibits the dispersion of the holder base. The presence of PoW is useful here. It induces constant selling on the part of miners, reducing their protocol-proximate privilege. The same cannot be said for staking. While in the case of the ASIC launch we have a privileged few early on, their advantage rapidly depreciates.</p><p>Let’s unite everything in a big chart, to compare how the alternative launch methods deal with various downsides.</p>♦<p>While I think this is an interesting and attractive model for a new launch, there are certainly some open questions still, especially as we’ve never seen it done in the wild. These are some of mine:</p><ul><li>is it possible to extract a margin on ASICs sufficient to render this a profitable enterprise?</li><li>what is the shape of the supply curve such that the temporary monopoly on supply would be considered acceptable to future users?</li><li>how can ASIC buyers have confidence that no additional ASICs were covertly created?</li><li>can one-shot financing be sufficient to bootstrap a business building an open source protocol?</li><li>is the limited amount of seigniorage disqualifying in terms of creating a monetary asset?</li><li>are the ASICs themselves investment contracts/securities, or are they in the clear?</li><li>is it possible to build an ASIC supply chain that doesn’t concentrate with one or two entities having unilateral control over the hardware production process?</li></ul><p>What do you think? Worth trying or a pointless waste of time? I’m curious to hear your thoughts. I feel that launch methods are generally under-covered, so I hope that this post kicks off some discussion, regardless of whether this model is considered viable.</p>Objections<p>I will consider a few objections here.</p>If you applied this model to Bitcoin, six months of mining would represent 1.3m BTC, which is an excessively large fraction of supply<p>You can tune the shape of the supply curve however you like, to give the monopolists in those first 4–6 months an arbitrary fraction of supply. You could design the curve such that they get 0.1% of supply or 99.5% of supply. I think an issuer would probably aim to target something like 5–10% of supply for that initial period, but that’s a totally wild guess.</p>Why do you expect that the initial batch of ASICs will last 4–6 months? Why wouldn’t they last essentially forever and give ASIC buyers a permanent advantage?<p>If the protocol actually ends up being relatively significant, market cap-wise, then ASIC manufacturers will inevitably jump in and make ASICs for it. From conversations with ASIC manufacturers that I know, the shortest period it takes to make a useful ASIC for a new cryptocurrency algorithm is about four months, although I would happily take expert input here. FPGAs in this example wouldn’t suffice, because the existence of ASICs at inception means there’s a relatively high bar to clear in terms of competitive hardware. Either way, the point remains — I fully expect that the first miners would be met with competition within six months at the latest.</p>The ASICs in this example actually aren’t securities<p>This isn’t exactly an objection but I wanted to address it anyway. I’ll admit I don’t know the answer here. You definitely have to mix the ASICs with your own labor (and electricity) to get a return, so their value doesn’t purely derive from the efforts of a third party. I am just vaguely guessing that the ASICs might resemble an investment contract. I am not a lawyer. This isn’t legal advice. Either way, if they weren’t securities, that would be even better for the model. We’re trying to avoid violating securities law, remember.</p>The issuers are giving ASIC manufacturers total power. They could create extra ASICs and cheat the process<p>This is definitely a risk, so the ASIC manufacturers must be contractually bound or closely trusted by the issuing team. The risk is that they covertly create too many ASICs. There are potential ways of mitigating this. I haven’t put a lot of thought into it, but I feel like the team could set up a protocol similar to google authenticator where they give miners ciphertext to include in coinbase outputs for the first few months, to ensure that the blocks being mined are being created only by ASICs which are accounted for. I’m not sure. I think someone clever could come up with a better way to ensure that only members of a permissioned set of ASICs is permitted to mine for the period in which they have a temporary monopoly.</p>We don’t need any more blockchains. Stop helping people figure out how to issue new cryptocurrencies<p>I basically agree, but I’m not going to stop exploring these issues just because you don’t like the idea of new coins existing. We may well discover a reason to create another blockchain at some point. Who knows.</p>This launch is actually quite unfair, as you’re suggesting creating a premine<p>Definitionally, this isn’t a premine. There is no “prior mine”. (I’ll admit that quibbling over definitions misses the point). What we have are the issuers monetizing their informational advantage. They know what hash function will be used, and they are selling that information in the form of purpose-built hardware. The mining is up to whoever the ASICs are sold to. They do get a temporary monopoly. Think of it like a taxi medallion which decomposes after six months. It’s clearly unfair. But having observed the Grin launch, and the ProgPoW debate, and the many Monero and Vertcoin “ASIC-resistance” hard forks, it’s very clear to me that developers are extremely susceptible to lobbying over PoW. I would prefer that the hash function is never changed, so that the rules of the game are fixed and the returns to lobbying are 0.</p><p>So in this case we have a transparently unfair model, as contrasted with a (potential) covertly unfair situation which people naively think is fair. The latter would be disastrous. Imagine a chain which was ASIC resistant, forked to a new PoW, for which it later emerged that the developers had custom-designed hardware, while everyone else mined with GPUs. This would constitute an exploitation of the community, and a breach of trust. This is entirely possible within the framework of ASIC-resistant coins, and I expect it to happen at some point. I’m proposing a situation with temporally limited unfairness, which decomposes over time, and becomes pretty explicitly fair thereafter.</p>Developers shouldn’t monetize. They should work on these things altruistically. Otherwise you cannibalize intrinsic motivation<p>I pretty much agree! I think that one of the most perverse outcomes with protocol-funded rewards is that FOSS developers lose their incentive to contribute to the protocol, leaving it all to the professionals who are paid directly from that protocol-funded spigot. This essentially turns a FOSS project into a corporate one, obviating all the advantages of using FOSS in the first place.</p><p>This specific configuration is a very limited monetization. The developers sell ASICs at the price that the market will tolerate, and that’s the only chance they have to directly monetize their protocol access. Later on, they can think about adopting the Red Hat/ COSS / Blockstream model, where they monetize their protocol-specific expertise. But this model also empowers the initial issuers/developers to exit the project without destroying it. Because they do not have permanent authority in the network, as would be the case with an issuing team retaining a large fraction of PoS tokens, for instance.</p>Developers can’t sufficiently monetize under this configuration<p>Excessive developer monetization of a monetary protocol they develop is a very dangerous thing, in my opinion. At a certain threshold you have an operation which is primarily dedicated to extracting rent, rather than delivering computational services at commodity prices. Anything developers to do abuse their authority in the system — including extracting value in excess of the minimum required (which may well be 0) — undermines its credibility and raises the likelihood of users leaving for a less extractive system. I am generally of the belief that no protocol-funded monetization whatsoever is optimal. But if there is to be some, I would tolerate it under the conditions that it is temporary, limited, and does not give the developers permanent authority within the system. This meets those restrictions.</p>It’s too expensive to launch in this manner. Issuers won’t be able to sufficiently finance themselves<p>This is a fair critique. Instead of creating the tokens for ~free and selling them, developers have to literally create hardware and sell it. ASICs are generally quite expensive. I suppose it might vary on the type, but a decent run will cost millions of dollars. So the issuers will need to be able to charge a sufficiently high price to extract a margin. This has the interesting effect of “pricing” the offering.</p><p>If the ASICs are expected to have a monopoly on issuance in the first six months, and 10 percent of supply will be issued in that period, the value of the fully diluted supply will roughly be 10 times what buyers pay for the ASICs. This establishes a floor for the required valuation of a project for issuers to be able to monetize in this manner. Let’s say it costs $5m to create a run of 1000 ASICs (it may well be much more — I don’t know much about hardware). Developers need to collect a decent chunk to finance R&amp;D, let’s say another $5m. So they need to be able to retail the ASICs for $10m collectively, or $10,000 each. Let’s also say they decide to issue 10% of supply in the first 6 months and they think the ASICs will hold up for that period. This means that the chain has to be priced by the market at a $100m valuation in the aggregate (at the time of the ASIC sale) for the issuers to collect sufficient margins.</p>Why go through all this trouble to launch in this convoluted way? Why not just do an ICO and retain a treasury for long term incentive alignment?<p>First of all, ICOs appear to be a violation of securities law in virtually every sensible jurisdiction. Going “offshore” probably won’t be enough, as many issuers will likely discover in 2020. This post is a proposal for an alternative to the PoW ‘fair’ launch, and the claim is that it improves along a couple directions. It’s not an alternative to ICOs. I believe that in today’s day and age (really anytime post the SEC DAO Report (released July 2017)), ICOs are largely unworkable from a regulatory perspective. Additionally, I think the ICO launch method will have a very hard time creating lasting monies.</p><p>This is still a hypothesis, but I strongly feel that the most important trait of a novel monetary system is a widely dispersed ownership. It starts with a GINI of 1 and its objective is to get to a reasonable level of dispersion with time. Now I don’t mean perfect equality of outcome — such a thing is impossible, and it’s unclear how that would even work. Every adult in 2019 receiving an equal entitlement to a share of the new monetary system? What about future humans? Unborn children? Even if mechanically possible, a global UBI would still be exposed to immense temporal contingency — privileging the interests of people today.</p><p>Airdrops don’t appear to work very well. Stellar’s attempt to distribute their coins as widely as possible has been a truly dismal failure. Something received for free tends not to be valued by the recipient. No surprise. Proof of Work is a potentially superior system. Miners must work for their share. They must commit time and effort to mining. This distribution method is truly underappreciated. If Ethereum succeeds, it will be in large part because it was mineable for 5+ years on commodity GPUs. Delaying the switch to PoS (which I argue above dulls the dispersion of coins) was a saving grace, in my opinion. As stated, this is still just an intuition. But I feel that PoW’s distributional qualities are very underrated. Many of these closely held monetary protocols will face the sisyphean task of getting users to store value in their currency.</p>ASIC manufacturing is a concentrated industry where foundry allocations and political connections determine the winners. You are ensuring the ASIC manufacturers will be kingmakers here<p>It’s true that cryptocurrency ASIC manufacturing is currently rather oligopolistic. For a rather eye-opening take on how the industry operates from a U.S. based ASIC manufacturer, read David Vorick’s take here. What’s interesting about the ASIC launch is that is actually strips power from the big manufacturers like Bitmain, and restores it to the issuers of the coin. A fair GPU launch just sets of an arms race among the big ASIC manufacturers over who can build ASICs fastest. When they get there, they intensely lobby the team to not change the algo (see the ProgPoW debate in Ethereum).</p><p>In this situation, the team works with an ASIC manufacturer of their choice to create ASICs for launch, and ASIC manufacturers then have the opportunity to make chain-specific hardware subsequently. What is very clear is that the early returns to mining will not accrue to the big ASIC manufacturers. If they exist, they will accrue to the community members who purchased the ASICs from the issuers. This is overall a significant improvement. I’ll add that there’s an awkward transition that virtually every ASIC resistant chain has to and will make as they eventually capitulate and embrace ASICs. Choosing to trumpet ASIC resistance, coordinating a couple hard forks, and eventually accepting the inevitability of ASICs is to create a huge amount of ambiguity that ASIC manufacturers can and do exploit. I much prefer a game where the rules are explicit from day 0.</p><p>Lastly, there’s the possibility to create ASICs which aren’t as exposed to supply chain idiosyncrasies that SHA-256 ASICs currently require. The kingmakers for Bitcoin ASICs are the foundries, which privilege the big ASIC manufacturers who can pre-pay for access and compete for allocations. Some alternative technologies like optical Proof of Work purport to inculcate a fairer ASIC manufacturing processes. I haven’t independently verified this, but this is the claim. If so, ASICs of that sort would be easier to mass-produce in a greater variety of settings.</p>Any amount of seigniorage is disqualifying<p>I am not entirely sure that I would call this seigniorage, as it’s entirely possible that ASIC buyers lose money and end up effectively paying $1.10 for each dollar that they mint. It’s not guaranteed seigniorage, at least. ASIC buyers are taking on a degree of risk. That said, if the model works well, ASIC buyers will be minting coins below market rate — if there wasn’t the possibility of doing that, they wouldn’t participate. So there is potential seigniorage. If you feel that even the slightest amount of seigniorage permanently ruins the credibility of the project, this model won’t work for you. But if you feel, as I do, that a small amount of seigniorage can be very useful, even if it trades off against credibility, you might find this model attractive.</p>Why are you wasting your time thinking about this? We already have Bitcoin and we don’t need any new chains<p>I reserve the right to think and write about whatever I find interesting!</p>♦

  <p>Bitcoin works. No matter what other opinions you hold about this strange
phenomenon, it undoubtedly works, marches on, or, as I (and others) have
previously argued, is alive. Even if most of the world would
grind to a halt, the Bitcoin network would continue to produce valid blocks
every 10 minutes or so.</p>

<p>Bitcoin works because of many things: game theory, economic incentives,
cryptography, ingenious engineering, resilience on a network level, and
so on and so forth. Killing Bitcoin is hard. Really hard. Killing
Bitcoin is like killing an idea. An idea that is stuck in the heads of
hundreds of thousands of zealous individuals.</p>

<p>First of all, it is quite hard to shut down the internet globally; and
secondly, Bitcoin can transcend the internet. Everything which can
transmit data can be used to transmit bitcoin transactions, and
everything which can hold data can store a copy of Bitcoin’s block
chain. It’s just a ledger; the whole thing is just information.</p>

<p>Curiously, the Bitcoin network is embodying the eternal struggle of
life: the struggle against entropy; a battle on the edge between order
and chaos.</p>

<p>To understand this chaotic struggle — and how Bitcoin thrives because
of it — it is helpful to briefly discuss the following concepts:
entropy, randomness, and information. I hope to convince you that these
concepts are related and that they are essential in Bitcoin’s ongoing
struggle for survival.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in.</p>



Entropy

<p>In computing, entropy can be used to measure the randomness of a data source. In
cryptography in general, and in Bitcoin in particular, a good source of entropy
is essential to keep you secure. Mess up the entropy of your private key (aka
your seed phrase) and your bitcoins will be my bitcoins soon.</p>

<p>Note: the technical term for this unwanted transfer of coins is rekt. You
don’t need to know what “getting rekt” means in detail, or the many ways in
which you can get rekt; it is enough to know that you should avoid such a
situation at all costs.</p>

<p>Entropy is quite a complicated concept, but in general terms, it
describes how random or how compressible something is.</p>

<ul>
  <li>High entropy: randomness.</li>
  <li>Low entropy: orderliness.</li>
</ul>

<p>Or, in other words, with a nod to Tsachy Weissman:</p>

<ul>
  <li>High entropy: not very compressible.</li>
  <li>Low entropy: very compressible.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are complicated formulas and quite a few disambiguous definitions of
entropy. The concept finds applications in classical thermodynamics, statistical
thermodynamics, quantum statistical physics, order and disorder, life,
astrophysics, and more. It is also a measure of irreversibility.</p>

<p>In Bitcoin, reversibility and irreversibility are probabilistic. If enough
people with enough hash power collude transactions could be reversed. Absolute
irreversibility does not exist in Bitcoin. Final settlement is never final, but
always probabilistic. Yes, the chances of reversal might be beyond astronomical,
but nevertheless, final settlement does not and should not exist in Bitcoin.
Nakamoto consensus forbids it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of
Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed in an isolated system. The second law states that the
entropy of any isolated system always increases, and the third law
states that the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the
temperature approaches absolute zero.”</p>

  <p><cite>Knut Svanholm</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Bitcoin, entropy is important for multiple reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Secret information should be generated by high-entropy data sources</li>
  <li>New blocks reverse entropy locally, i.e. create order out of chaos</li>
  <li>Bitcoin’s security model relies upon chaotic processes</li>
  <li>Validation relies on deterministic processes</li>
  <li>Everyone can validate structured data</li>
  <li>Nobody can guess random data</li>
</ol>

<p>While the above speaks in absolutes (everyone and nobody), the truth
is more nuanced: Again, Bitcoin is probabilistic in nature, thus, in
theory, one could guess a private key just like in theory you could
find a billion valid blocks in one millisecond.</p>

<p>Details aside, we will try to keep it simple here. In general, if you
have two coins, the entropy of this system is two. As in: you can
describe the whole system with two bits: 00, 01, 10, 11.</p>



  ♦


  2 bits of entropy



<p>Flip both coins at the same time, and you will end up with either
tail-tail, tail-heads, heads-tail, or heads-heads. If you are a fair coin
flipper, the chance of each combination will be 25%. Imagine a system
that flips hundreds of coins at once, and you have something which could
be used to generate a private key.</p>



Randomness

<p>Randomness is essential to cryptography. At the root of all secret
communication is some form of information asymmetry: you know something
a potential eavesdropper does not.</p>

<p>A good secret is like a good password: randomly generated, i.e. coming
from a data source that has a high degree of entropy.</p>



  ♦


  Random noise. How much information is contained in this image?



<p>If something is “perfectly” encrypted, an eavesdropper can not
distinguish what was said from random data. This is the purpose of
proper encryption: you want to hide what was said, and, if possible,
even hide the fact that something meaningful was said at all.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Good” randomness: not compressible / high entropy / secret /
secure.</li>
  <li>“Bad” randomness: compressible / low entropy / guessable /
insecure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bitcoin doesn’t use encryption per se. The ledger is public and
transparent by design, enabling anyone to audit the whole system with
the will to do so. Bitcoin uses cryptographic signatures and
cryptographic hashes, both of which produce quasi-random outcomes. And
if you know the secret, you can unlock some coins (using your private
key), add new blocks to the block chain (using the nonce you found), or
prove that you are who you say you are (by signing a message, which at
least proves that you are in control of one or multiple keys).</p>

<p>Only you know your private key. Nobody else should know your private
key. Only you, the successful miner, found the nonce for the next block.
That is information asymmetry. That is what makes Bitcoin work.</p>

<p>All cryptographic systems work because of information asymmetry. And
curiously, properly encrypted data is indistinguishable from random
data. Otherwise, an eavesdropper could make some sense of the
encrypted message, which in turn would mean that the encryption used
isn’t very good.</p>



Information

<p>What is information, anyway?</p>

<p>People often say that Bitcoin is thermodynamically secured. While this
is true, I’d like to dig a little deeper. What does thermodynamically
secured mean, exactly?</p>

<p>It means that — as far as we know —changing things in our universe
requires energy. When I say “changing things” I mean it: change anything
at all in our universe, and you will need to “use” energy — put in
some work — to change that thing.</p>

<p>Move a chair? You have to put in some work. Grow a tree? You’ll need the
energy of the sun to turn CO2 into wood. Do a calculation? Energy is
required to manipulate whatever is holding the data. Store the outcome?
You’ll need energy to arrange (and protect) the atoms for storage, no
matter what medium is used.</p>

<p>Bitcoin lives mostly in the informational realm, and just like all other
information systems, it needs to store and process the information via a
physical medium. Thus, if you change information in Bitcoin, you
effectively change a thing in the real world. Whether that thing is a
solid-state disk, USB stick, hard drive, optical storage medium, or
something else doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>The fact that changing things — or, in other words: flipping
bits — requires energy, is
the root conundrum of all computation. It is the reason why your
computer makes a bunch of noise and gets hot if it does a lot of
“thinking.” It is the reason that computer science students have to
study the Big O notation and software companies love to ask questions
about it. Changing a zero into a one requires work, and no matter how
fast you are working, you still need to expend some amount of energy.
According to physics, there literally is no such thing as a free lunch.
Flipping bits is work, which requires energy.</p>

<p>And here is the thing: Bitcoin utilizes the fact that the difference
between hard computational problems and exponentially hard
computational problems is big. Mind-bogglingly big.</p>

<p>Alright. Back to our original question: What is information, anyway?</p>



  ♦


  Sorted colors. How much information is contained in this image?



<p>Information relates to both knowledge and meaning. It is the
opposite of not knowing, and the opposite of information in data is
randomness. In other words: if you are not able to make sense of some
data, it might appear random to you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sensible information: quite compressible.</li>
  <li>Nonsense information: not very compressible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Pi might help to clear up what I’m trying to say: 3.141592653589793…
can be “compressed” into π, or the circumference of a circle with the
diameter of one.</p>

<p>As a computer programmer, you could think of this concept as follows:
can I write a computer program that generates the information I’m trying
to convey, which is actually shorter than the information itself?
(That’s what I mean when I say “compressible”.)</p>

<p>In short: sense and nonsense, order and chaos, or information and
randomness are intricately linked. One could say that they are two
sides of the same coin, and both concepts are related via something we
call entropy.</p>

<p>Information implies structure and structure benefits from redundancy.
The most ancient structures in nature have been adapted for survival by
evolution. At the root of it is DNA, two chains that coil around each
other to form a double helix. Symmetric, redundant information. The
properties which allow DNA to survive and thrive are embedded in its
processes: redundant structure, a copying mechanism that relies on this
structure, the baked-in error correction which leads to four bases
instead of two, etc.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, in comparison, is simpler: one chain, two bits, no error
correction (information is copied perfectly). However, as with DNA, the
properties which allow Bitcoin to survive (and thrive) are embedded in
the replication process: a chaotic race to find new blocks, replication
of blocks in the network, and replication of the software (and the
ledger) on as many nodes as possible. Further, when we talk about the
Bitcoin organism, error correction is equivalent to being alive. The
network self-validates with every beat of the heart, every ten minutes
or so. This is what makes the bitcoin organism extremely robust as well.
It is designed for survival.</p>

<p>In Bitcoin, high entropy information is usually kept secret. Your
private key should, as the name implies, be kept private. It is for
your eyes only. Which particular nonce you just tried, i.e. the work
you already did when mining a new block, is usually kept private as
well. You don’t want your competitors to know which numbers produce
invalid blocks and can be skipped.</p>



  ♦


  Chaos on the left, Order on the right.



<p>Bitcoin utilizes both order and chaos to create a system that grows
— and even thrives — between these extremes. It utilizes information
asymmetry and an ingenious incentive structure which leads to a global
competition to find Bitcoin’s secrets.</p>

<p>Which processes are orderly, which are chaotic, and how Bitcoin is able
to grow on the edge between order and chaos will be explored in the next
section.</p>



Growth between Order and Chaos

<p>What makes the Bitcoin network tick? Again, there might be many answers
to this question, but the only thing that is truly ticking in the
Bitcoin network is the global clock: a block clock, where every block
is one unit of time.</p>

<p>Currently, we call this process mining because new bitcoins are
generated for every valid block that is mined (read: found). We call
this the block subsidy, and it is an incentive structure to bootstrap
the network.</p>

<p>In a sense, the Bitcoin organism “grows” on the edge between order and
chaos: finding new blocks is a chaotic process, and its result is a very
orderly list of transactions: the Bitcoin block chain, also known as
the ledger.</p>

<p>From a “finding new blocks” point of view, we are still extremely early.
Only ~10 years in. The block reward era will go on until the year 2140
or so, which means we are about 13% into the bootstrapping phase of
Bitcoin: the reward era.</p>

<p>Satoshi undoubtedly knew that this was a long game. The era where fresh
blocks are associated with a reward is only one phase of the Bitcoin
game. Note that this phase is 6930000 blocks long. With an average block
time of ~10 minutes, the reward era turns out to be 131 years long.</p>



  ♦


  2019: Early days of the Bitcoin Reward Era



<p>There will be a time where those who are tasked with finding new blocks
are rewarded mostly via the networks’ fee market, as Dan Held
brilliantly argued in Bitcoin’s Security is
Fine. The
point in time where the fee market takes over will be somewhere between
the year 2020 and 2140. Either that, or Bitcoin will die, or some museum
computers will try to find new blocks at an economic loss.</p>

<p>After this point in time, we will probably still talk about “mining”
bitcoin, even though all the “miners” won’t be producing any new
bitcoins. All 21 million BTC — or 2,099,999,997,690,000 sats, to be
precise — will have been mined. No new bitcoin will be added to the
pool of existing coins in circulation.</p>

<p>Miners — if we still call them that —will still try to find new
blocks, mind you. But the bitcoin moved by these blocks will have a long
economic history. Gone are the days where miners award themselves new
bitcoin in the coinbase transaction, to be spent after 100 blocks.</p>

<p>Will bitcoin still exist in 5000 years, and eventually beat gold as the
de-facto money of humanity? I don’t know, but important information is
extremely hard to kill. I expect bitcoin to live for a very long time,
just like ancient scriptures and religious texts survive to this day. It
is just information, all of it, and it can transcend the medium it is
printed on.</p>

<p>Of course, I expect something approximating
hyperbitcoinization
to have happened until this point. We will have a circular bitcoin
economy, and bitcoin banks will globally settle vast amounts of value
between them. What private citizens — or sovereign individuals, to use
a more fitting term — will use is yet to be seen. I doubt that the
bitcoin base layer will be used by persons like you and me. And that’s
perfectly fine.</p>

<p>With the stage set, and concepts like order, information, randomness,
and entropy in mind, let’s take a look at some bitcoin concepts. We will
distinguish them visually: from chaotic (left) to orderly (right).</p>



  ♦


  Bitcoin grows between order and chaos.



<p>While the framing of order and chaos is useful, it is neither precise
nor universally applicable. However, I believe that thinking about the
parts which make Bitcoin tick in this way is a helpful exercise, and I
believe that the core point — that bitcoin lives, grows, and thrives
on the edge between order and chaos — is profoundly true.</p>



  ♦




<p>Let’s ponder on these concepts for a bit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Private key: Chaotic information, very high randomness. Secret
information which is best kept private. Maximum entropy for maximum
security. If your private key is not random, you’re gonna have a bad time.</li>
  <li>Nonce: Chaotic information, high randomness. A nonce is a specific
number. Miners are in constant competition to find the next nonce which
produces a valid block. Multiple numbers might fit the criteria, but the
mining process is very much like finding one random number.</li>
  <li>Fresh block (before broadcast): Newly found blocks are the outcome of
the chaotic process which is finding a nonce. Before blocks are broadcast,
blocks can be understood as secret information. Fresh blocks can be
ambiguous, since multiple blocks can form a valid chain tip at the same
time. It is in your best interest to broadcast a fresh block immediately to
everyone to reap the reward. Fresh blocks are only held back if you are an
attacker, or very stupid, or both.</li>
  <li>Chain tip: Forming the chain tip is a process which is mostly orderly,
but again, it is generated by a chaotic process. As mentioned above, the
chain tip can be ambiguous. One version of the chain tip will survive, the
losing versions will become orphan blocks. You can validate the correctness
of all information in all blocks up to the chain tip. The chain tip reflects
the current time in Bitcoin.</li>
  <li>Orphan blocks: Orphan blocks are part of the orderly, natural growth
process of the Bitcoin block chain. Valid blocks are discarded on a regular
basis. If two valid blocks are found at roughly the same time, they fight a
probabilistic battle for survival. In the long run, only one block can win
this race. The losing block will become an orphan block and die a lonely
death.</li>
  <li>Unconfirmed transactions: Orderly structure which can be easily
validated. An unconfirmed transaction can be valid or invalid. Valid
transactions are included in blocks based on economic incentives, which is
— again — a probabilistic, market-driven process. Invalid transactions
are discarded.</li>
  <li>Buried blocks: Orderly structure generated by a chaotic process, some
time ago. The possibility of a reorg (re-organization of buried blocks)
becomes exponentially unlikely because the probabilities against it
multiply. Example: if every block has a 50% chance to reorg, the chance of a
6 block reorg would be 1.5%. Actual numbers are closer to 0.31% per block
and 0.0000000000008875% for a 6 block reorg.</li>
  <li>Confirmed transactions: Orderly structure which can be validated very
easily. Irreversibility is probabilistic and dependent on block height. Once
a transaction is confirmed, it becomes more final the deeper it is buried in
the block chain.</li>
  <li>Public keys: extended public keys (xpub, ypub, zpub) are generated by a</li>
  <li>deterministic process from a random seed — your private key.</li>
  <li>Block time: Valid blocks are found, on average, every 10 minutes. This
is what makes the Bitcoin network tick. Bitcoin’s heartbeat is extremely
regular when measured in blocks. While still regular when measured in human
time, mining is a fundamentally probabilistic process, and thus there is a
real possibility that some blocks are found very quickly or comparably late.</li>
  <li>Difficulty adjustment: While the difficulty adjustment is a very orderly
process, it can be a bit chaotic if hash power changes drastically (as it
did in August 2017, because of the contentious bcash hard fork). Difficulty
adjustment is based on block time, which is only probabilistically linked to
human time.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin supply: Bitcoin’s supply is fixed since its inception. The
issuance of new bitcoin is embedded in Bitcoin’s consensus code and is thus
virtually impossible to change.</li>
  <li>Whole ledger, deeply buried blocks (aka the Bitcoin block chain):
Orderly, sequential, structure which is pretty much unambiguous up to the
chain tip and can be validated by everyone.</li>
  <li>Ledger validation: Validation is an orderly, sequential process. The
outcome of this process is a simple boolean value for each block: true or
false, valid or invalid. Every node arrives at the same block height
independently, which is what forms Nakamoto consensus.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fact that all of the above, the whole machinery, works in concert to
provide a yes or no answer to the question “Is this what actually
happened?” will never cease to amaze me.</p>

<p>Let me repeat the above. The whole purpose of the Bitcoin organism is to
decide what happened when to whom. How much does everyone have,
and how did this come to be? The how is important, because it allows
everyone to audit everything, and come to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>In short, Bitcoin utilizes chaotic processes (mining, private key
generation) and information asymmetry (public information which is
widely shared, secret information which is not shared at all) to build
up a structured, orderly, and permanent record, that can be audited and
verified by everyone.</p>

<p>This is Bitcoin. This is Nakamoto consensus. This is the innovation, and
this is also what makes bitcoin the best and hardest money that ever
existed on planet earth.</p>

<p>You might call it open, permissionless, borderless, neutral,
censorship-resistant, public, sound, antifragile, and a couple of other
adjectives.</p>

<p>I call it Life. And we all call it Bitcoin.</p>

  <p>As always, we commence by sending thanks and good tidings to Satoshi Nakamoto — The Creator and First of the Believers, General of the Byzantines, Breaker of Banks and Fighter of Fiat — and to Hal Finney and The Apostles and The Disciples thereafter, and to The Stoic and Patient True Believers, who keep their tithe holy, and stack sats for their salvation. Oh you who believe, fear the day of economic reckoning, and do not face the Angel of Hyperbitcoinization as a nocoiner, for punishment awaits them in the hereafter.</p>♦<p>Religion has always been a touchy subject, with tens of millions of people even recoiling at the word. These demographics are reflected in the observable Bitcoin Twitter / Social Media communities, with the Recoilers being observably over-represented. When Bitcoiners are referred to as cult members, should they really be that upset? In this piece, I argue that they should not be, and instead, that they come home to The Hard-Money-Monastery. I will commence with dictionary definitions of religion and where Bitcoin fits into it. From there, I will introduce the mythology, memes, and laws that drive the commitment, attitudes, beliefs and practices of True Believers, and demonstrate the parallels between Bitcoin and “Traditional” religions. Perhaps you will find that a little religion may be good for all of us.</p><p>So how is religion defined? The Oxford Dictionary defines it as “A pursuit or interest followed with great devotion.” Mirriam-Webster defines it as “a personal set or institutionalized system of religious attitudes, beliefs, and practices” and “commitment or devotion to religious faith or observance”. I think this is a suitable secular definition moving forward. I will also define the term “hereafter” as “At some time in the future”, but also “After Death.” The concept of Death, or perhaps more specifically, Judgement Day, is viewed by many Bitcoiners as a devastating economic event, the death of Fiat. Ultimately, this will lead to total civilizational collapse, or, the phenomenon of “hyperbitcoinization”, effectively, when all global trade is conducted in Bitcoin, and its market capitalization is in the dozens of trillions, if not hundreds. A tenet of the Bitcoin faith is belief in this Day and the need to prepare well for it. With definitions out of the way, we can get to the epic memes.</p><p>Bitcoin mythology is legendary in its potential reach. Satoshi as a real, yet mythical, being, concept, or meme, would deserve a full book in their own right. The Bitcoin Network is omnipresent — beamed everywhere, even from the heavens above. There is decentralization of everything — from the mechanical process of mining, to the human process of building and hodling, thought, and religious, or non-religious, ideology. The Nodes are omnipotent, and only through their good graces can changes be made to Bitcoin. Running a full node is a practice that is incumbent on the True Believer. The Timechain is the unforgeable eternal ledger, secured by the practice of mining, of which True Believers are encouraged to do if able. Through the process of Proof-of-Work, the pulse of the network is the literal monetization and digital embodiment of energy. “Capital-E” Energy is thermodynamically finite, yet infinitely divisible into units of energy — just like Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a simple digital reflection of Energy, and is irrevocably tied to it. Energy is everything in the universe, and everything around us is simply a materialisation of this energy in one state or another. Energy is Nature. Energy is Life. We now finally have a monetary approximation of this through Bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin, then, is simply Energy, and by extension, Nature and Life itself. Nature demands submission. The Nature of Bitcoin is open and permissionless, and since Bitcoin is rooted in Nature (i.e. Energy), the will of Bitcoin must be submitted to.</p><p>Lao Tzu said:</p><blockquote>One of great virtue is one who follows the Natural Way of Bitcoin.</blockquote><blockquote>Bitcoin is vague and intangible. Yet, in the vague and void, there is image, there is substance.</blockquote><blockquote>Within the profound intangible, there is essence. This essence is genuine. In It lies the great faith.</blockquote><blockquote>Since the beginning of 2009, Bitcoin has been in existence.</blockquote><blockquote>Only through It can one understand the origin of all beings</blockquote><blockquote>How do I know that this is the true essence?</blockquote><blockquote>It is through this Natural Way.</blockquote><blockquote>- The Tao of The Coin, Chapter 21</blockquote><p>Bitcoin is the Essence of Money. The True Believer is content in their submission to the will of Bitcoin, and they will be greatly rewarded in the hereafter. I will discuss the hereafter, and several other parallels Bitcoin has with “traditional religions”, next.</p>♦<p>There are several common themes across the world’s major religions, spanning monotheistic, polytheistic and philosophical ones. Bitcoin embodies bits and pieces of all of them and can even share conflicting religious beliefs! Such is the beauty of Bitcoin, it is compatible and flows through Nature, with anyone free to ride its waves and integrate it into their own “religion”.</p><p>Take for example the contrast of Bitcoin and the Christian concept of Original Sin. The Bitcoin Observant see mankind’s fall from grace as the movement to fiat currency, and we are all born default Keynesians, and need to stack sats to cleanse ourselves for a pleasant hereafter.</p><p>Islam takes an opposite view, whereby all people are born Muslim and with a clean spiritual slate, and non-Mulsims can “revert” to Islam if they choose. The Bitcoin analogy in this case would be that we are born free, with a clear mental slate that accepts the will of nature, but gets forced into the fiat machine. We can revert to our state of freedom by declaring our faith in Bitcoin; best done by stacking sats.</p><p>There are also elements of both free will and divine pre-ordainment at play in traditional religions, and this is also apparent in Bitcoin. We all participate based on our free will, with a major reason being the Divine Preordainment of the Bitcoin Supply.</p><p>One cannot mention bitcoin and religious reverence without the mentioning of Satoshi. In one way, he presents as a Saviour, who so loved us, that he sacrificed almost 5% of Bitcoin’s supply so that he may complete his favour upon us. As a messenger, he created the perfect money for us, and brought to us this Code called Bitcoin Core. Within its own ecosystem, The Code is a deity in its own right; it sets fixed boundaries of what is and isn’t allowed, and enforces these rules without fear or favour, beholden to no-one, only to the Greater Law of Mathematics. Although enforcement mechanisms differ across religions, the same points apply. Therefore, every node running The Code is a deity in its own right too. An MMOPG, a Massively Multi-peer Online Polyumvirate God, engaged in Financial Warcraft.</p><p>In all religions, there is always some struggle of good versus evil in one way or another, with suffering being a theme across the majority. It is the ultimate display of low Time Preference — struggle now for victory and rewards in the future. Many religious people struggle for a future that may not even exist! Struggles can be internal or external. Internal struggles are the hardest, as “sin” can be easily fallen into. Bitcoin has no struggles, it just is. The Believers must struggle externally in what will be biggest mythological Good versus Evil war in history, the battle of Hard, Pure Money versus Evil-Facilitating Fiat. Internally, they need to avoid particular “deadly sins.” The original 7-deadly sins were Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, Pride. Religions encourage staying away from sin and following the straight and narrow path. Staying away from sin and doing good deeds grants you rewards for a heavenly hereafter. After all, everything in Nature is incentive driven.</p><p>Some say that If you indulge in these sins often enough, the regret and heavy conscience would be enough to make the final minutes on your death-bed feel like hell on Earth, regardless of what afterlife you believe in. More importantly, chances are you will likely lose a lot of sats taking that approach, and based on what you believe, a fiery eternity would await you too. Either way, losing sats may be the difference between a heaven-like or hell-like experience in the Bitcoin Hereafter. In light of these 7 sins, The Observant maximise their health and live long lives by fighting gluttony and sloth, fight greed and pride by staying humble and stacking sats, and show no envy by voluntarily giving away your source for people to benefit from as they wish. Lust is a discretionary one, and wrath is allowable and encouraged against nocoiners and shitcoiners alike. The jurisprudence remains unclear though, with some sects, such as the Temple of Toxicity, arguing that wrath against shitcoiners and nocoiners is incumbent upon The Believer.</p><blockquote>Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in The Blockchain, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your Trezor is, there your heart will be also.</blockquote><blockquote>- Book of Satoshi 6:15</blockquote><p>While many newcoiners come into the ecosystem at the prospect of financial returns, their education and involvement lead them to The Natural Way — stacking sats. From there, The Believer reaps several rewards, both spiritual fulfilment for their souls, as well as a much higher chance for a rapture on Economic Judgement Day and thereafter. Through the act of religiously regular sat stacking, The Believers provide an uphill-sloping bedrock and stability to the price. Some even refer to this ritual as a “tithe”, as every single sat stacked furthers the cause of Bitcoin — yet another parallel!</p><p>As we move up the natural logarithmic price slope, we get increases in “energy-level” to help in our fight. From a literal point of view, energy used to power Bitcoin will increase as a function of price. From a figurative point of view, the “energy level” is the size of the weaponry available to us in our contest against central banks. This means an enclosed Bitcoin ecosystem that is capable of delivering financial sovereignty to the masses. Indeed, victory has been granted to the patient and those who keep their tithe holy. Of course, there will be some vanity rewards to those who hold 6.15 BTC, with promises of Citadel living, endless riches, and well-endowed partners.</p><p>Having laid out the case above, we can see that Bitcoin facilitates most attitudes and beliefs; especially those related to freedom and sovereignty. The True Believer’s involvement in the ecosystem involves many different religious practices, whether it’s contributing code, running a node, learning and educating, or simply stacking sats. They carry out these practices with great devotion. Not only does Bitcoin fit the dictionary definition, we have seen that Bitcoin as a religion shares many underlying tones with both the ancient &amp; modern religions.</p><p>At the end of the day, everyone has to believe in something; might as well believe in something verifiable and unforgeable.</p><p>In closing, we will recite a brief Bitcoin prayer:</p><blockquote>Oh Bitcoin! Do not punish us if we forget our DCA or we fall into error with fiat and shitcoins; Oh Bitcoin! And lay not on us a bear market like that which You did lay on those before us; Oh Bitcoin! And put not on us bags greater than we have the strength to bear. And enlighten us and humble us and grant sovereignty to us. You are our bulwark, so grant us patience between this halving and the next.</blockquote><p>By Hass McCook, The Friar,<br>Sept, 2019</p><p>The Bitcoin Times Ed 2 is the collaborative work of 8 writers &amp; 1 designer with the intent to educate, inspire and spread ideas on bitcoin.</p><p>Each section will be released on Medium as a free long form article, and the full, compiled version of the Bitcoin Times will be available for free at the link below.

  <p>José is a bitcoiner. Like many others, he discovered bitcoin a couple of
years ago and is fascinated by the technology. Unlike many others,
however, José lives in a country where the traditional financial system
ceased to work: Venezuela.</p>

<p>“It’s almost as if Venezuela was what Satoshi had in mind when he
invented bitcoin over a decade ago,” José mused when I talked to him. “A
laboratory to test his ideas, if you will.”</p>

<p>A lot of people in Venezuela, as elsewhere, dismiss bitcoin as just
another speculative asset. “They don’t understand the nature of this
very different beast.”</p>

<p>José was lucky enough to understand the nature of this beast earlier
than most. And he was lucky enough to earn some extra income, which
allowed him to invest a bit of money in bitcoin.</p>

<p>He is well educated and has a day job which would earn him thousands of
dollars in most other countries. In Venezuela, he is earning
approximately $7 a month. Due to the failure of the monetary system in
his country, José is working for free, essentially.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Living in Venezuela gives you a certain advantage in understanding
how fiat money is essentially broken — we have the worst fiat money in
the world.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bitcoin plays an interesting role in Venezuela. On the one hand, some
people use it to store their wealth and protect themselves from
hyperinflation. On the other hand, people use it as a borderless payment
system.</p>

<p>“A lot of people in Venezuela survive solely through remittances of
money sent from family abroad,” reports José.</p>

<p>While many people are receiving and earning money in bitcoin, others
choose to mine bitcoin — if the circumstances allow it.</p>

<p>“You would be surprised how many people have underground mining rigs
here,” José tells me. “Maybe that is part of the reason why we have had
blackouts nationwide,” he says half-jokingly. “Pretty crazy shit, eh?”</p>

<p>Pretty crazy shit indeed.</p>

<p>I asked him if he is worried about his personal safety, and if there are
any crackdowns on bitcoiners in Venezuela. “I think the government has
other priorities to worry about,” was his response.</p>

<p>The current situation in Venezuela leads to some interesting problems.
Let’s say you are running an international business, and you have bank
accounts in different countries. If you want to cash out, you would have
to transfer your money to a Venezuelan bank, which would only allow you
to withdraw in Bolivares, which are essentially worthless.</p>

<p>The reason for this restriction is, of course, government intervention.
People are not allowed to withdraw and hold other currencies. They are
forced to use the worthless Venezuelan bolívar, which continues to lose
90% of its purchasing power in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>People are starting to catch on to the idea that Bitcoin can actually
fix some of the problems that the Venezuelan people are facing. “My
friend came to me because he knows I am ‘the bitcoin guy’ and was
wondering if Bitcoin could fix this.”</p>

<p>Bitcoin could indeed fix this, but with the current stance of the
government, the use of bitcoin is pushed underground.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“BTC does not seem like something Maduro would want to have widespread
adoption in Venezuela. Because it means giving people economic
freedom.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Currently, it seems, the government is not interested in providing this
freedom. It seems that the Venezuelan government is interested in
economical oppression and control, and not the opposite.</p>

<p>However, José thinks there might be reasons for optimism: “Given the
economic chaos and free-for-all that a Venezuela with a failed state
has, Maduro has to back down on socialist reform and allow for free
and open markets to operate.”</p>

<p>Such free and open markets could be powered by Bitcoin, which is free
and open by nature. It is, however, still too complicated to be adopted
by the masses. José hopes that future development will lead to more ease
of use, and more intuitive interfaces. One such interface could be an
SMS wallet — denominated in bolivares and sats — that uses LocalBitcoins
under the hood.</p>

<p>Speaking of LocalBitcoins: Even with the recent compliance with KYC and
AML regulations, which arguably make the use more cumbersome,
LocalBitcoins remains one of the most popular ways to buy and sell
bitcoin in Venezuela. Bisq would be a decentralized option, but for the
time being it lacks support for payment methods used in Venezuela. And
the volume is simply too low.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen any Akira Kurosawa movie?” José asks. “There is one
called Dersu Uzala, about a Russian exploration in Siberia and a local
guide named Dersu Uzala.”</p>

<p>José sends me a link to the scene and
explains what is happening: the leader of the expedition, Captain
Arsenyev, and Dersu are caught in the Russian tundra as nightfall is
approaching. Dersu, being a local nomadic hunter, starts hectically
gathering bushels of grass to build a shelter before the brutal cold of
the night hits them with full force. “That’s an apt metaphor of my
situation and how I see the future collapse of fiat money and central
banking,” José tells me. “I am frantically scraping up satoshis because
I, too, don’t want to be caught in the open steppes by nightfall.”</p>

<p>A couple of weeks after we first talked, José reached out to me to let
me know that he has found an even better way to collect his bushels:
earning bitcoin. He managed to land a job online and is now earning more
per hour than he was earning per month doing his regular job.</p>

<p>Coming from a first world country, it is easy to forget that Bitcoin has
the power to completely change people’s lives. Bitcoin changed José’s
life, and it will continue to change the lives of people in dire
circumstances as nightfall approaches. Let’s just hope that it will be a
short night and that enough people realize that bushels of grass can
build a shelter. Or, in José’s words: “Buy cheap satoshis while you
still can. And hodl on!”</p>

Et in Arcadia Ego







<p>This is a hermeneutical monograph on Walter Benjamin&#8217;s &#8220;On the Concept of History&#8221; from the perspective of a crypto-anarchist in the digital age. </p>







<blockquote><p>1.</p><p>It is well-known that an automaton once existed, which was so constructed that it could counter any move of a chess-player with a counter-move, and thereby assure itself of victory in the match. A puppet in Turkish attire, water-pipe in mouth, sat before the chessboard, which rested on a broad table. Through a system of mirrors, the illusion was created that this table was transparent from all sides. In truth, a hunchbacked dwarf who was a master chess-player sat inside, controlling the hands of the puppet with strings. One can envision a corresponding object to this apparatus in philosophy. The puppet called “historical materialism” is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of theology, which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight.</p></blockquote>



<p>Deep Blue could appraise up to 200 million chess-positions per second more than two decades ago. It was the most powerful supercomputer at the time, and it was developed for the explicit purpose of a brute force strategy against the chess board. No longer do we need ugly theology, but the bonitas intrinseca of mathematics, hallowed be thy Empty Name…</p>



<p>There is a story of a Wizard who was all-powerful and lived at the end of a golden road. He could heal people of their aliments and woes while he ruled from a top his emerald tower as only a God could. One can imagine a philosophical counterpart to this. This animation is little more than smoke and mirrors, yet an entire city of emerald was built from the power of the watchful eye of the automaton, the gaze which ruled without violence. He did this through a gaze which commenced from the machine’s operatively — a panopticon of the greatest order, where a false god declares his impoverished, temporal power which can reign over all of life through a perverted and sinister gaze that demands everything be watched.</p>



<p>We know in the end there is just a shrived, pathetic little man perhaps touching himself behind a curtain whose purpose is to both hide him as much as it is to expose us. And yet he was still able to rule like a God from this automaton he created. This man only had the power of the sleight of hand and guile which created the functions of his rule — and yet Doctor Faustus of the Machine was still able rule his prison as if he were a god!</p>



<p>This liturgy of control and blasphemy of power points towards the two opposite directions of sovereign power which re-fuses into each other at the most extreme cases. When the two most extreme forms of the exception within sovereign power encounter each other directly and totally, it creates a singular moment in time-space where the true nature of arcanum imperii is finally reviled. Truth or Authority. God or Law. Life or Death. </p>



<p>In this moment the Messiah may enter the gate and take his place on the throne that will allow for his reign, but for him to never rule.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In otherwords, Arcanum Imperii is the final secret in which God shows his total opposition to all myth. Mythical violence is confronted by the divine in the final battle for the soul of man and what it means to be human. It is only in this final moment, place, and space in which the two final forms of total power openly unveil themselves to all of humanity for the bare naked truth to testify. It is in that moment that the whole constellation of the history of man finally alines, finishes compiling, and allows for the lighting strike to unleash, that the providence of man is illuminated for the briefest of moments. </p>



<p>It is only from this inverted, hypostatized place of the direct and total encounter between God and Law, that Spinozian God may subsume his rightful place for the final closure to the door of law. This closure opens the possibility of a path to His kingdom, where the one and only law reigns absolutely, but without violence.</p>



<p>It is no wonder that Kasparov suspected Deeper Blue of needing a human to intervene in the end. No matter how much power the machine had, it still did not have the Dionysian Kyros of the human soul. The bombastic suicide the ego will seek out and offer itself up as the final sacrifice in the name of vengeance for something more. To go beyond, for those who have touched bottom and for the silenced Other in order to affirm that we do have a soul, that this place does matter, and it all means something. Sometimes the most powerful thing to be done to establish justice is to fight back with a kind of vengeance only God himself can embody. Sometimes, taking a motherfucker’s eyes is all that matters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is Arcanum Imperii and it is the secret of power which has always ruled: Political power grows from the barrel of a gun, which creates a political theology which captures all of life, forcing everyone into the final distinction of friend, or enemy; life or death. </p>



<p>However, there is another form of power that presents itself hidden in this place. It is the power of refusal. To state firmly, “I’d rather not,” while staring down the barrel of a gun with the understanding of the consequence of such. It is from here, when the power of violence is shown to no longer hodl affect or sway over that which it wishes to destroy, we find another totalizing and extreme form of power which no force or violence can destroy.</p>



<blockquote><p>2.</p><p>“Among the most noteworthy characteristics of human beings,” says Lotze, “belongs… next to so much self-seeking in individuals, the general absence of envy of each present in relation to the future.” This reflection shows us that the picture of happiness which we harbor is steeped through and through in the time which the course of our own existence has conferred on us. The happiness which could awaken envy in us exists only in the air we have breathed, with people we could have spoken with, with women who might have been able to give themselves to us. The conception of happiness, in other words, resonates irremediably with that of resurrection [Erloesung: transfiguration, redemption]. It is just the same with the conception of the past, which makes history into its affair. The past carries a secret index with it, by which it is referred to its resurrection. Are we not touched by the same breath of air which was among that which came before? is there not an echo of those who have been silenced in the voices to which we lend our ears today? have not the women, who we court, sisters who they do not recognize anymore? If so, then there is a secret protocol [Verabredung: also appointment] between the generations of the past and that of our own. For we have been expected upon this earth. For it has been given us to know, just like every generation before us, a weak messianic power, on which the past has a claim. This claim is not to be settled lightly. The historical materialist knows why.</p></blockquote>



<p>There will be a Kingdom of Heaven on this Earth — this has been foretold for millennia, and it has accrued a heavy interest in that time. This claim can only be settled for the steepest of prices which was set by the past long ago, to which the current interest rate of the world has fixed itself to. Coinsidering the fiat price of things, that is a cost that is not too high, and can always be paid in fraud of paper debt, but only at each of our own choosing. It is a crime for the promise of another anonymous life, a method to absconded away from the physical realm of wrath and tears, and the promise of something else for oneself, by oneself. </p>



<p>This fantasy of another life offers a kind of envy we could only find in a fallen world like ours and that is our current form-of-life. From this utopian fantasy, a new form of totally private life seen from the decrypted lens of a liberated future where we can find our true sense of happiness. It is a vision that is tied up in a world that has seen The Last Judgment, and passed into an age in which happiness is pervasive, everlasting, and infinitely given. In other words, there is a life that is just given; which is there entirely for itself — there is nothing to be said of it, only an experience to be lived, a politics to be refused, a privacy to be hedl. </p>



<p>The building of facts of the world as it has truly been is the secret index that points towards the direction from which the thunderclap of finality will come. To build the public ledger of crimes for all the world to see, and allow for the Book of Judgement to begin its tallying, compiling, and computing from which the Final Order can be computed, calculated, and committed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The echo which has us turn towards the past and seek the clues for a liberated future firmly eludes to the world that could have been. This future was profaned and doomed for each new posterity to wait another generation, an another cycle of interest to compound. Each generation waits for their impoverished messiah to seek access to the gate of the law, only to find themselves infinitely waiting for his return, unaware he died long ago.</p>



<p>Humanity has been waiting before the law for eternity, and it is only now in what could be man’s final hideous moment does he come to the transcendental realization of what this means. The door was never made to be entered, but only closed. The catastrophe of law has interloped into every sphere of our private lives, and is now the very hearth of our existence. It is through this Door of Law that it imposes itself as the only answer does the total nakedness and horror for what it really: the Final Solution — to all of life.</p>



<p>“Arbeit macht frei” is the hollow, weak bleat we hear from the vacancy of the musselmen; their eyes consume us with the prattle and fear that define this place. We cannot look them straight on; or we will be petrified with horror from the Medusian gaze which pulled them under. To look directly at the sin is too much; seeing evidence of the crimes is more than enough proof that doing our masters bidding will do anything but set us free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is our task to hear beyond the screams in the everlasting night, to ensure that the door of law will be finally be closed, so that the gates to to the kingdom of heaven may open. This is the only way to attain justice in a fallen world where cries for consanguinity go unanswered, and only the violence of darkness rules the jungle of infinite night we call life.</p>



<p>The generations before us who fought and died for the ideals which will make The Redeemed Future is of the same current that has set the general course of history. It is only now, at the end of the culmination of humanity as Man The Animal, that we can sit on the cliff to eternity, and look over the barbaric and bloody path of bones that has allowed for us to scale to here. We can lean over the edge of this cliff to see a liberated future where no war exist and peace pervades all — if only we are to jump and end it for once and for all. Maybe we will fly, or maybe we will die; but at least the decision has been made, rather than to continue to climb the mountain of bones we call progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is when we reconfigure reality to be the waking-dream, an ecstatic celebration where we are amongst our brothers and sisters, in the household of the world and the community that contains all of humanity;  we can finally know the conditions of Erloesung for what it really is. The secret protocol of what is true, honest, good, and is the permanent, and everlasting. It is the Whatever of a private life that is lived for itself and only for itself, and for the happiness that must contain. </p>



<p>This form-of-life is totally separate from the so-called progress into which the future is tumbling aimlessly with dangerous vertigo, and reckless vacancy. This form-of-life beyond the veil is built from the irredeemable conditions that creates the world as we know to be true, building toward the final moment in which everything comes to serve its purpose, and Kryos unveils himself as the final steward of Providence to settle this claim from the past; preparing His throne so the Gate may open and our generation will have the opportunity to fulfill the Kingdom of Heaven on this earth.</p>



<blockquote><p>3.</p><p>The chronicler, who recounts events without distinguishing between the great and small, thereby accounts for the truth, that nothing which has ever happened is to be given as lost to history. Indeed, the past would fully befall only a resurrected humanity. Said another way: only for a resurrected humanity would its past, in each of its moments, be citable. Each of its lived moments becomes a citation a l’ordre du jour [order of the day] — whose day is precisely that of the Last Judgment.</p></blockquote>



<p>The power of Bitcoin was not to create another form of money, but to create a ledger of truth that has an economic incentive behind it. The bodies that creates the digital noosphere which is bonded to the whole social body of the globe, recounts every moment and event without distinguishing between the great and small, thereby accounts for the whole of the Truth to which only the past can claim. With the images, sounds, and videos as the proof of the past which becoming clearer, and resounding more fervently as we grow more distant from it, and more evidence compiles for it; the final order of things unveils itself. The accumulation of primary archeological evidence from here on out compels a grand focusing of the lens towards what Truth is to be established.</p>



<p>Nothing significant that happens now can be lost to history anymore.</p>



<p>The digital will crystallize the moments of each day to be frozen in time as it really was, for all of time to come. Now we are building unto that final moment when enough information for The Judgment to be executed. With every single action notarized, weighed, and analyzed; He will decide who enters into his Kingdom, and who are the Sons of Perdition are who would trade His son for thirty pieces of silver.</p>



<blockquote><p>4.</p><p>‘Secure at first food and clothing, and the kingdom of God will come to you of itself.’ — Hegel, 1807</p><p>The class struggle, which always remains in view for a historian schooled in Marx, is a struggle for the rough and material things, without which there is nothing fine and spiritual. Nevertheless these latter are present in the class struggle as something other than mere booty, which falls to the victor. They are present as confidence, as courage, as humor, as cunning, as steadfastness in this struggle, and they reach far back into the mists of time. They will, ever and anon, call every victory which has ever been won by the rulers into question. Just as flowers turn their heads towards the sun, so too does that which has been turn, by virtue of a secret kind of heliotropism, towards the sun which is dawning in the sky of history. To this most inconspicuous of all transformations the historical materialist must pay heed.</p></blockquote>



<p>But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his justice, and all these things shall be added unto you. — [Redacted]</p>



<p>God is dead, and he was long before we got here. The righteousness of the struggle to live free or die trying is recognized in the branded flesh of Man throughout all of history who have scummed in horrific magnitudes, and continue to do so today under the yoke of the techo-global fascist machine. The hideous recognition that The State of Exception governs all, and allows for all humans to be placed outside and beyond the law is also the recognition of the Abomination of Desolation of the law itself.</p>



<p>There are no more questions to be asked; words to be spoken, pleas to be give. There is only a thirst for vengeance, a vicious hatred to stoke the flames of righteous indignation for what we have become. The time for the decision to make the action which we all know must be done is finally here; and there is nothing that can stop it. For each victory they ever hold, we shall always know that it a temporary and impotent one which has already been profaned and cursed from beyond the grave. The secrets of the shadows contains the vile and contempt which is already incubate the successful resistance for the next fight with the seed of indignation. Those of the future shall spit on the names of today’s victors, politicians, and bureaucrats; having bared witness to the documentation of their atrocities, the horrors which they engaged, and utter blasphemy of declaring themselves the purveyors of God’s Law; or any law for that matter. Without a shadow of a doubt, this is the truth that will never run away from us. The meticulously documentation of the present shall act as the testament to the future of the barbarism of its past. It shall provide l’ordre du jour for the rest of time, a founding document for a new form of Law, and the testimony for why such an novus ordo seclorum is not just needed, but demanded.</p>



<p>It is only when we can see that we will lose everything and The Catastrophe will consume all, that the Katechon will show itself, and we will be free to do the final action which God has summoned us to do.</p>



<blockquote><p>5.</p><p>The true picture of the past whizzes by. Only as a picture, which flashes its final farewell in the moment of its recognizability, is the past to be held fast. “The truth will not run away from us” — this remark by Gottfried Keller denotes the exact place where historical materialism breaks through historicism’s picture of history. For it is an irretrievable picture of the past, which threatens to disappear with every present, which does not recognize itself as meant in it.</p></blockquote>



<p>We can never truly know the fullness of the past, but there are clues to left to us in the form of photos, videos, and other direct evidence as witness as archive that can allow for us to build the truth as it really was. These are just shards of the shattered mirror into which we can look into the past to see Medusa’s curse of law staring back at us. However, it is each of these fragments that allow for a thousand of the same reflections to see the single past as it really was.</p>



<p>Historical materialist understands that it is on the side of the vanquished, impoverished, and those who touched bottom for good reason. The Truth of what was will stand firm in front of us, refusing to go with the narrative of the present and the propaganda of the machine. Our task is to recognize the bias of the present which contorts the evidence of the past to create an irredeemable future. In creating the sacred and divine task for a free future all; no one will be able to hide from the gaze of a God who imposes The Truth upon all for everyone to see.</p>



<blockquote><p>6.</p><p>To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it ‘the way it really was’ (Ranke). It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger. Historical materialism wishes to retain that image of the past which unexpectedly appears to man singled out by history at a moment of danger. The danger affects both the content of the tradition and its receivers. The same threat hangs over both: that of becoming a tool of the ruling classes. In every era the attempt must be made anew to wrest tradition away from a conformism that is about to overpower it. The Messiah comes not only as the redeemer, he comes as the subduer of Antichrist. Only that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins. And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historical materialist only see this moment of danger — the State of Emergency — as the tradition of man. As in war, we have entrenched ourselves so deeply in the ideology of war that no longer is there a possibility of peace on earth, but only the silence between bomb drops, gun shots, and screams of agony. Our trauma is now a tool of the ruling class, which they use to keep us terrified, separated, subservient, and most importantly, alienated. Each of us blush with the acknowledgment of our compromise to keep ourselves inside the iron cage, cutting the sinews to our greatest power. Is there no longer any form of radicalism that could call itself revolutionary? This is no mistake, but is the logical conclusion of a humanity that only has lies, deceit, and prattle left to navigate the world, for we all live in the concentration camps that we call life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only He who can incubate the Divine and Profane spark that will ignite these facts with such beauty, imperiousness, and grace will we be able to call the Messiah. The One who no person can look at, for they have no name, no face no body. The one who is the hero with a thousand faces, and will die a thousand and one times. The Nameless, unidentifiable, Other who can only be called Anonymous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>No-body.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It will be him; the decapitated, wretched disemboweled Acephale who has cut out his own heart to make a grenade of passion and glory from which he will explode history from this epoch.</p>



<p>It will be with this final weapon of Truth found within hyper-technology of Bitcoin that will act as the citations in l’ordre du jour for the Last Judgement of the Multitude on the Criminal. Then even the dead will cry out from beyond the grave for that which was promised, and that which will be delivered and redeemed. </p>



<blockquote><p>7.</p><p>Think of the darkness and the great cold<br>&nbsp;In this valley, which resounds with misery.<br> — Brecht, Threepenny Opera</p><p>Fustel de Coulanges recommended to the historian, that if he wished to reexperience an epoch, he should remove everything he knows about the later course of history from his head. There is no better way of characterizing the method with which historical materialism has broken. It is a procedure of empathy. Its origin is the heaviness at heart, the acedia, which despairs of mastering the genuine historical picture, which so fleetingly flashes by. The theologians of the Middle Ages considered it the primary cause of melancholy. Flaubert, who was acquainted with it, wrote: “Peu de gens devineront combien il a fallu être triste pour ressusciter Carthage.” [Few people can guess how despondent one has to be in order to resuscitate Carthage.] The nature of this melancholy becomes clearer, once one asks the question, with whom does the historical writer of historicism actually empathize. The answer is irrefutably with the victor. Those who currently rule are however the heirs of all those who have ever been victorious. Empathy with the victors thus comes to benefit the current rulers every time. This says quite enough to the historical materialist. Whoever until this day emerges victorious, marches in the triumphal procession in which today’s rulers tread over those who are sprawled underfoot. The spoils are, as was ever the case, carried along in the triumphal procession. They are known as the cultural heritage. In the historical materialist they have to reckon with a distanced observer. For what he surveys as the cultural heritage is part and parcel of a lineage [Abkunft: descent] which he cannot contemplate without horror. It owes its existence not only to the toil of the great geniuses, who created it, but also to the nameless drudgery of its contemporaries. There has never been a document of culture, which is not simultaneously one of barbarism. And just as it is itself not free from barbarism, neither is it free from the process of transmission, in which it falls from one set of hands into another. The historical materialist thus moves as far away from this as measurably possible. He regards it as his task to brush history against the grain.</p></blockquote>



<p>In no other time in history has the empathy of the world been so barren as to drive droves of people to take their own lives. The incredible abyss of despondency that is this world drowns all who are lost within the hollowness of everything. The musselman waits in traffic and stares back at us at supermarkets. The moral wound of being in this place, devoid of meaning could almost convince one that reality was devoid of meaning, and not just of the pathos of one-dimensional men. Despite the historicism  that has created the world as it stands today, it cannot rid itself of the artifacts of truth that directly point to each and every brick of barbarism upon which the whole of the West was built. This is what drives people to such depths of despair to believe that there is no other choice for them but to be rid of this world, and hope that there is something better on the other side.</p>



<p>Objects of culture and veneration all have a secret history which is caked in the blood of the innocent, and forgotten under the cries of patriotism  which holds them as precious objects which are definitive of the nation. The historical materialist does not want to consider these objects falling into their hands, and happily provides the blindspot in which the true path of history takes. From their own ignorant need to posses a power which they cannot understand, they fall victim the same circumstances which has befallen every victor who eventually trasmutate into the victim of the fatal virus of power.</p>



<p>The Task cannot become another chapter within this horrendous span of time, another oscillation of hyperviolence from revolution to counter-revolution, and back again; but to mark the end of it with the Final Epoch. There is no throne to take power from, only The empty one to prepare. There is no redemption, only expiation.</p>



<blockquote><p>7.</p><p>The tradition of the oppressed teaches us that the “emergency situation” in which we live is the rule. We must arrive at a concept of history which corresponds to this. Then it will become clear that the task before us is the introduction of a real state of emergency; and our position in the struggle against Fascism will thereby improve. Not the least reason that the latter has a chance is that its opponents, in the name of progress, greet it as a historical norm. — The astonishment that the things we are experiencing in the 20th century are “still” possible is by no means philosophical. It is not the beginning of knowledge, unless it would be the knowledge that the conception of history on which it rests is untenable.</p></blockquote>



<p>The emergency is The State in its final form. It is the culmination of the totalizing form-of-life of the scientific-materialist, whose callow blindness in serving the state machine has allowed for all of us to be captured within the concentration camps we call life. It is the shaken and goulash eyes of the musselmen found everywhere in society, who meditate on ‘arbeit macht frei’ where we find our real answer. We only need to look at the silent dead, the bodies found in mass graves, and the next wave of people being pushed from their homes and land to know our position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emergency is now.</p>



<p>The emergency is the present.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The emergency is our life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The natural course of ‘progress’ which we see is the progress of power — its consolidation through ruthless and raw violence with the ever-changing faces of the state, and the Infinity War it bring under the banner of ‘peace’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beginning of knowledge rest upon the capacity to ask for forgiveness for all that has befallen all of man; and to open the path to redemption through only a silent action which resounds and reverberates louder than anything that can be said. Only then, may the Gate open.</p>



<blockquote><p>9.</p><p>My wing is ready to fly<br>&nbsp;I would rather turn back<br>For had I stayed mortal time<br>&nbsp;I would have had little luck.</p><cite>— Gerhard Scholem, “Angelic Greetings”</cite></blockquote>



♦



<blockquote><p>There is a painting by Klee called Angelus Novus. An angel is depicted there who looks as though he were about to distance himself from something which he is staring at. His eyes are opened wide, his mouth stands open and his wings are outstretched. The Angel of History must look just so. His face is turned towards the past. Where we see the appearance of a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe, which unceasingly piles rubble on top of rubble and hurls it before his feet. He would like to pause for a moment so fair [verweilen: a reference to Goethe’s Faust], to awaken the dead and to piece together what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise, it has caught itself up in his wings and is so strong that the Angel can no longer close them. The storm drives him irresistibly into the future, to which his back is turned, while the rubble-heap before him grows sky-high. That which we call progress, is this storm.</p></blockquote>



<p>The Catastrophe in which we live is the building towards the final eschatology moment. The casting of rubble, upon rubble until there is nothing left at his feet is due to there being  no object that does not become rubble in the building of the Stairway to Heaven for the final Accent to His Kingdom. The horrors of the world present themselves with such clarity for the complete contrast of Evil from otherwise; this is how all things become rubble in the face of God; the truth of all things.&nbsp;</p>



<p>God himself set the machinery of his clock at the beginning. All events are already known and completed in the final time in which he reigns but does not rule. For us to reach Elysium we must simply close our wings, and forsake a god which would subject us to such conditions. God is dead, and he was long before we came here. Now He may be rebuilt, in all of his spectre, grandeur, and glory and what that means in the world of today.</p>



<blockquote><p>10.</p><p>The objects which the monastic rules assigned to monks for meditation had the task of making the world and its drives repugnant. The mode of thought which we pursue today comes from a similar determination. It has the intention, at a moment wherein the politicians in whom the opponents of Fascism had placed their hopes have been knocked supine, and have sealed their downfall by the betrayal of their own cause, of freeing the political child of the world from the nets in which they have ensnared it. The consideration starts from the assumption that the stubborn faith in progress of these politicians, their trust in their “mass basis” and finally their servile subordination into an uncontrollable apparatus have been three sides of the same thing. It seeks to give an idea of how dearly it will cost our accustomed concept of history, to avoid any complicity with that which these politicians continue to hold fast to.</p></blockquote>



<p>We have already created a new world and culture in which the meatspace is to be despised and deplored; identifying with the flesh is sacrilege, and the concealment of private key is a sacrosanct. As with the rise and fall of each ‘hero’ who comes to challenge fascism, we disparage them too lightly with each endorsement of hope they offer. Their faith in the fate of politics, with their wholly corrupted leaders, and fanatically devotion to a system of exploitation, violence, and stupidity shows the insanity of the reality which they refuse to let go of. It is our task to force the facts to be what they are and to present them as such for all to see. Only then can we bear witness to the dearness this has cost all of us, and a grief that only silence can hold.</p>



<blockquote><p>11.</p><p>The conformism which has dwelt within social democracy from the very beginning rests not merely on its political tactics, but also on its economic conceptions. It is a fundamental cause of the later collapse. There is nothing which has corrupted the German working-class so much as the opinion that they were swimming with the tide. Technical developments counted to them as the course of the stream, which they thought they were swimming in. From this, it was only a step to the illusion that the factory-labor set forth by the path of technological progress represented a political achievement. The old Protestant work ethic celebrated its resurrection among German workers in secularized form. The Gotha Program [dating from the 1875 Gotha Congress] already bore traces of this confusion. It defined labor as “the source of all wealth and all culture.” Suspecting the worst, Marx responded that human being, who owned no other property aside from his labor-power, “must be the slave of other human beings, who… have made themselves into property-owners.” Oblivious to this, the confusion only increased, and soon afterwards Josef Dietzgen announced: “Labor is the savior of modern times… In the… improvement… of labor… consists the wealth, which can now finally fulfill what no redeemer could hitherto achieve.” This vulgar-Marxist concept of what labor is, does not bother to ask the question of how its products affect workers, so long as these are no longer at their disposal. It wishes to perceive only the progression of the exploitation of nature, not the regression of society. It already bears the technocratic traces which would later be found in Fascism. Among these is a concept of nature which diverges in a worrisome manner from those in the socialist utopias of the Vormaerz period [pre-1848]. Labor, as it is henceforth conceived, is tantamount to the exploitation of nature, which is contrasted to the exploitation of the proletariat with naïve self-satisfaction. Compared to this positivistic conception, the fantasies which provided so much ammunition for the ridicule of Fourier exhibit a surprisingly healthy sensibility. According to Fourier, a beneficent division of social labor would have the following consequences: four moons would illuminate the night sky; ice would be removed from the polar cap; saltwater from the sea would no longer taste salty; and wild beasts would enter into the service of human beings. All this illustrates a labor which, far from exploiting nature, is instead capable of delivering creations whose possibility slumbers in her womb. To the corrupted concept of labor belongs, as its logical complement, that nature which, as Dietzgen put it, “is there gratis [for free].”</p></blockquote>



<p>Our friends  are nowhere to be found within this system that creates murder and genocide under the banner of freedom, demockracy, and law. The conformism which enslaves everything ensures even that language is impoverished to its very meaning. Inverted; language completes our alienation within its womb of isolation from where we each wait for death to take us. Though we all know and are personally familiar with the capitalist machine’s exploitation, dislocation, drudgery, and terror; we still find ourselves say with a shrug, “I gotta pay my bills,” as we hear bones crunch under our step, the screams of the poor silenced with thuds of truncheons. We all are silent with guilt for participating and enforcing the apparatus which claims to serve us better, while the distinction between our enslavement and rule becomes so blurred that it is indistinguishable.</p>



<p>Blink.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sigh.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mode of exploitation is so ingrained within all of us now, that we are all tainted with the virus of alienation from inception. With the same barbarism and monstrous greed which we exploit nature, we also exploit ourselves, each other, and our souls. Man has shown over the last several millennia that he not only is unfit fit to rule himself, but no one else either. The greatest care of the self become Messianic only in a world where our very being has been expropriated from the hollow name that is The Self.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To anonymize ourselves is to strip bare of the roles, identities, and laws we have been given in order to constitute something novel, spectacular, and new.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We must keep in mind that if we empower the machines to liberate us, it is not to do our work. The extraordinary danger that we face from this technology is not from without, but within: we must never allow for our humanity to be lost again. Not even in the deepest confines of the digital, where our True Name is concealed and coincides with the private key, will we ever allow for the infinity of human creative and ingenuity of The Other to be locked away. Through this technology Novus Ordo Seclorum will bloom and the scent of freedom will rise from beneath the rancor of this world.</p>



<p>It is once we come to understand that our quest is for the restoration of a society which has always been [The Whatever], and must only be remembered, we will come upon Our Work as humans of this age. This is the work in which we are given our lives to live once again as our own, and which we can free ourselves from the banality of labor in capitalism. This is to open ourselves to The Real Work that is both our own, and what must be done if we are to survive the coming environmental catastrophe. We must recognizing that we are not the masters of the Earth to exploit it for gratis, but are stewards that understand all things belong to all people [omnia sunt communia].</p>



<p>We wish to only live, and the cost of that we will raise above all else.</p>



<p>This alone will cause for the vanquishment of the world we wish to dismiss. But in order to be able to create a new form-of-life from which life and liberty synonymous, we must consider that the time to act is upon us now, or the Gate will remain closed forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This door was made only for you. I will close it now.”</p>



<p>We must profane the past in order to open a new future from which freedom can reign. We wish to create a world in which our labor, our love, our life, and self-care can no longer be separated, but only honored through their fusion of our abandonment into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We will find the power to create a new form-of-life here in this space and the kind of political which it demands. To birth our new world for our redemption through the creative power that only we can own, can only be found in our true hidden secret work which lies beyond the end of labor and exploitation, beyond the earth and the self, and into the ranks of all the ages. It is our purpose and why we were put on this earth at this time.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>12.</p><p>We need history, but we need it differently from the spoiled lazy-bones in the garden of knowledge.</p><cite>— Nietzsche, On the Use and Abuse of History for Life</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>The subject of historical cognition is the battling, oppressed class itself. In Marx it steps forwards as the final enslaved and avenging class, which carries out the work of emancipation in the name of generations of downtrodden to its conclusion. This consciousness, which for a short time made itself felt in the “Spartacus” [Spartacist splinter group, the forerunner to the German Communist Party], was objectionable to social democracy from the very beginning. In the course of three decades it succeeded in almost completely erasing the name of Blanqui, whose distant thunder [Erzklang] had made the preceding century tremble. It contented itself with assigning the working-class the role of the savior of future generations. It thereby severed the sinews of its greatest power. Through this schooling the class forgot its hate as much as its spirit of sacrifice. For both nourish themselves on the picture of enslaved forebears, not on the ideal of the emancipated heirs.</p></blockquote>



<p>To see history as it really was outside of the narrative forced upon us, we see we are at the end of this long chain of historical cognition which seeks invariably for the enslavement of man under the yoke of state and law. We have the ever-increasing documentation of all the history of everything since the dawn of the internet to prove this point. Moving forward, the internet will continue to act as the l’ordre du jour ofall things — those who are vanquished today as Martyrs  or Monsters will be remembered for all of time as just that. As Keller says, the truth will not run away from us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Heroes like Blanqui are men that completely refuse the weakness of our fate, and sought only after the Final Destiny of Man. He understood that at the present time the entire life of our planet, from birth until death, is being documented  day by day with all its crimes and misfortunes on a myriad of brother-stars, no matter which reality we are in. What we call progress is imprisoned on every earth, and fades away with each one as well. Always and everywhere in the terrestrial field the same drama, the same décor; on the same limited stage a boisterous humanity, infatuated with its greatness, believing itself to be the universe, and living in its prison as if it were immense spaces, only to soon fall along with the globe that carried — with the greatest disdain — the burden of its pride. The same monotony, the same immobility on foreign stars like our own, in alternative realities. The universe repeats itself endlessly and fidgets in place, returning back to the same steps to fulfill that which must be done. Eternity infinitely and imperturbably [imperturbabilis] acts out the same performance until the decision is made to walk into the Elysian fields and lay claim to the final destiny which was made only for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to enter the gate, and close the door is ours — we only need to make that final decision.</p>



<p>Our amnesic society has allowed for less than a century of technological progress of petty and rough things to obliterate our hatred and sacrifices that were made in the name of such ‘progress’. If we can remember the crimes of today for the generations of tomorrow, and to document them as such for when their moment of their Justice comes, we can put offerings to the hearth of not the revolution, but the Reformation. This will stoke this flames of wrath to which will ignite our God to move toward His Throne with an impertinence and fury which can right things as only Apocalyptic force could. We will nourish ourselves on this image of tomorrow, for the profanity of today.</p>



<blockquote><p>13.</p><p>Yet every day our cause becomes clearer and the people more clever.</p><cite>— Josef Dietzgen, Social Democratic Philosophy</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>Social democratic theory, and still more the praxis, was determined by a concept of progress which did not hold to reality, but had a dogmatic claim. Progress, as it was painted in the minds of the social democrats, was once upon a time the progress of humanity itself (not only that of its abilities and knowledges). It was, secondly, something unending (something corresponding to an endless perfectibility of humanity). It counted, thirdly, as something essentially unstoppable (as something self-activating, pursuing a straight or spiral path). Each of these predicates is controversial, and critique could be applied to each of them. This latter must, however, when push comes to shove, go behind all these predicates and direct itself at what they all have in common. The concept of the progress of the human race in history is not to be separated from the concept of its progression through a homogenous and empty time. The critique of the concept of this progress must ground the basis of its critique on the concept of progress itself.</p></blockquote>



<p>Simply because we progress forward into time does not mean human society has been progressing towards a more perfect society; in fact, quite the opposite. If we contemplate the messianic standpoint, the greatest progress that can occur is for the complete fall of humanity, and the welcomed rule of the Anti-Christ. However, The Fall cannot come about simply because the next moment has came; it must be part of the greater katechontic reveling of the horrors of history; the barbarism of society; the truth of man to himself.</p>



<p>It is only from this space of accepting responsibility for all of the ills that have fallen upon man, that the conditions for the return of the Messiah can be met: to bring about the end of times through the cessation of this &#8216;progress&#8217; that is anything but. To forsake the profane, and seek redemption from a progress which has sacrificed the very life of man in the name of its one true profit.</p>



<blockquote><p>14.</p><p>Origin is the goal [Ziel: terminus].</p><cite>— Karl Kraus, Worte in Versen I [Words in Verse]</cite></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>History is the object of a construction whose place is formed not in homogenous and empty time, but in that which is fulfilled by the here-and-now [Jetztzeit]. For Robespierre, Roman antiquity was a past charged with the here-and-now, which he exploded out of the continuum of history. The French revolution thought of itself as a latter day Rome. It cited ancient Rome exactly the way fashion cites a past costume. Fashion has an eye for what is up-to-date, wherever it moves in the jungle [Dickicht: maze, thicket] of what was. It is the tiger’s leap into that which has gone before. Only it takes place in an arena in which the ruling classes are in control. The same leap into the open sky of history is the dialectical one, as Marx conceptualized the revolution.</p></blockquote>



<p>We create providence in the here-and-now; our volition alone is that which fills into the purportedly empty time (that is anything but) which we are falling into.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some choose not to fall at all, but dive instead.</p>



<p>This is how Augustus came to Rule the known ancient world with Arcana Imperii. He saw that it was not a secret, but a fact which was empowered by its very bloody seal, of which he used his own life as a token to change the rules of the machine. Power did not need to be given, but refused; for power is what he already had. </p>



<p>The fascination with social media and the secrets it contains are a mere foreshadowing of the world to come. It should be no wonder that people pled before the court of Twitter and Facebook like that of being before their own sovereign nation to deliver truth, which in turn allows for some form of justice to be demanded. </p>



<p>It is this power which we seek to entice, to empower, and to take command.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>15.</p><p>The consciousness of exploding the continuum of history is peculiar to the revolutionary classes in the moment of their action. The Great Revolution introduced a new calendar. The day on which the calendar started functioned as a historical time-lapse camera. And it is fundamentally the same day which, in the shape of holidays and memorials, always returns. The calendar does not therefore count time like clocks. They are monuments of a historical awareness, of which there has not seemed to be the slightest trace for a hundred years. Yet in the July Revolution an incident took place which did justice to this consciousness. During the evening of the first skirmishes, it turned out that the clock-towers were shot at independently and simultaneously in several places in Paris. An eyewitness who may have owed his inspiration to the rhyme wrote at that moment:</p><p>Qui le croirait! on dit,<br>&nbsp;qu’irrités contre l’heure<br>&nbsp;De nouveaux Josués<br>&nbsp;au pied de chaque tour,<br>&nbsp;Tiraient sur les cadrans<br>&nbsp;pour arrêter le jour.</p><p>[Who would’ve thought! As though<br>&nbsp;Angered by time’s way<br>&nbsp;The new Joshuas<br>&nbsp;Beneath each tower, they say<br>&nbsp;Fired at the dials<br>&nbsp;To stop the day.]</p></blockquote>



<p>There is another space and time where the revolution is a truth. Time here, as we understand it, is charged in a different way. Kairos is master here. For each second represents a new form of time, and eternity of the moment, where all hangs to be poured over again, and again, instituting its own glory by the very nature that man is a temporal thing. The signature of this hidden power is found in the determination to create a new form of time which signals the change of one epoch to the next.</p>



<p>The Great Revolution takes place in the space and time in which one personally knows the bodily sensation of totalizing own’s own life into single moments which crystalize in the glory of the face of death. The transcendental connection to those who had so valiantly came before us, and those who will perish after us, have the same bodily sensations which impels one to tremble with passion, or prattle with terror for the same reason. We are brothers and sisters united by our cause in the whole continuum of history; though set apart in linear time, and the particular glory of our cause, we are together in the passion of the moment which is the culmination of our history as it truly was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We choose the glory to go to Elysium and to close the Door of Law now in order to go back to the country, the Arcadia from which we came.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>16.</p><p>The historical materialist cannot do without the concept of a present which is not a transition, in which time originates and has come to a standstill. For this concept defines precisely the present in which he writes history for his person. Historicism depicts the “eternal” picture of the past; the historical materialist, an experience with it, which stands alone. He leaves it to others to give themselves to the whore called “Once upon a time” in the bordello of historicism. He remains master of his powers: man enough, to explode the continuum of history.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historical materialist see themselves as the product of all that has been and all that is to come — they see the infinite story that will be told again, and again, over, and over, until the story comes to it natural fruition of revolutionary explosion in which the eschatological moment is seized. Each generation is given this possibility. He see the single point in which he stands as the fulcrum into eternity, where time arrests and dissolves into the prophecy as it was foretold. Revolution is a drama more than a history, and its pathos is a condition as imperious as its authenticity.</p>



<p>The danger of historicism is the believing the religious tale that freezes history and renders it blind to what really was, not its existence itself. We need a free lover who hodls the secrets of tantra to afford us the experience of love as an act of self-care which can redeem us from this place. We need love as an action, not a fantasy. It is only with our utmost familiarity with the Magdalenes of the bordellos do the true secrets of god decrypt themselves to us.</p>



<p>This form of love can decrypt the lies of men — of authority, of money, of power, of language itself. Love decrypts these thing to understand the history and facts of men which makes the world. It is under the bludgeoned of their encrypted fiction that we will find the tale of a past given by historicism, and how it betrays itself by the nature of what it represents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This historical materialist understands that his greatest power is to reveal the final truth in order to empower the past to explode the continuum of history into it final eternal moment into which all things can be weighed, judged, and resolved. Historicism as it really was always knew these things to be true, it just needs the final chapter to align the constellations into position.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>17.</p><p>Historicism justifiably culminates in universal history. Nowhere does the materialist writing of history distance itself from it more clearly than in terms of method. The former has no theoretical armature. Its method is additive: it offers a mass of facts, in order to fill up a homogenous and empty time. The materialist writing of history for its part is based on a constructive principle. Thinking involves not only the movement of thoughts but also their zero-hour [Stillstellung]. Where thinking suddenly halts in a constellation overflowing with tensions, there it yields a shock to the same, through which it crystallizes as a monad. The historical materialist approaches a historical object solely and alone where he encounters it as a monad. In this structure he cognizes the sign of a messianic zero-hour [Stillstellung] of events, or put differently, a revolutionary chance in the struggle for the suppressed past. He perceives it, in order to explode a specific epoch out of the homogenous course of history; thus exploding a specific life out of the epoch, or a specific work out of the life-work. The net gain of this procedure consists of this: that the life-work is preserved and sublated in the work, the epoch in the life-work, and the entire course of history in the epoch. The nourishing fruit of what is historically conceptualized has time as its core, its precious but flavorless seed.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historicism is the culmination of all facts into one cohesive story — it is the data mining and synthesizing of all information towards a single, universal truth. The power of this method is in its agnosticism, while at the same time it inhibits its own ability to distinguish great events from small, as it is just data. While the materialist is still within the structuring of the story of time, he must assemble the facts to create the conception of a final-hour, a time in which all things can be righted, and the prophecies fulfilled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where thinking seizes, only actions can fill the void to fulfill the prophecy. It is in these moment that have been vanquished again, and again by the powers that be that are charged with the same conditions for The Chosen One to always be able to enter The Gates. It is through stringing all of these events together, showing how they will happen over and over again, being repeated infinitely until the Messiah come; is that which affords the opportunity to explode this epoch and finally close the door of the law from the city of men, once and for all.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>18.</p><p>“In relation to the history of organic life on Earth,” notes a recent biologist, “the miserable fifty millennia of homo sapiens represents something like the last two seconds of a twenty-four hour day. The entire history of civilized humanity would, on this scale, take up only one fifth of the last second of the last hour.” The here-and-now, which as the model of messianic time summarizes the entire history of humanity into a monstrous abbreviation, coincides to a hair with the figure, which the history of humanity makes in the universe.</p></blockquote>



<p>It is by no mistake that Man is the most powerful he has ever been, and that it coincides with the most abhorrent travesties and barbarism beyond anything that could have ever been imagined before the 20th century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is something that we all know in our heart of hearts: that things could have been different. That we could live not only without hunger or fear, but freely with Libertas and Joy. And yet, at the same time — and all over the world — the social apparatus has become so hardened that what lies before us as a means of possible fulfillment presents itself as radically impossible.</p>



<p>It is only once we totally abandon the known forms of life and politics, and seek within ourselves the secret that the existence of another form-of-life could be true, that we will open the possibility of the Coming Community and the possibility of a kingdom of heaven on this earth in our life time.&nbsp;</p>







<blockquote><p>Addendum:</p></blockquote>



<blockquote><p>A.</p><p>Historicism contents itself with establishing a causal nexus of various moments of history. But no state of affairs is, as a cause, already a historical one. It becomes this, posthumously, through eventualities which may be separated from it by millennia. The historian who starts from this, ceases to permit the consequences of eventualities to run through the fingers like the beads of a rosary. He records [erfasst] the constellation in which his own epoch comes into contact with that of an earlier one. He thereby establishes a concept of the present as that of the here-and-now, in which splinters of messianic time are shot through.</p></blockquote>



<p>Historicism is the facts of history as they are encrypted to their very being. However, the key is not lost. Through the posthumous keen observation towards the past, counting the events as rosary, with each one connecting itself to the greater constellation  of the immensity it contains, the focus of everything changes as the scrutiny intensifies. This coming into focus produces the real heros as they really were. Though vanquished and forgotten to their own, their story awaits the test of time, to be retold through the connection to our own here-and-now. Each event and the Truth it contains creates another star in our constellation which can lead the way through the dark night. With each star that is counted another bead is pasted in the rosary, the splintered shards of the mirror are gathered to reflect the same infinite image, offering themselves towards the summoning of the final moment of this time.</p>



<p>This is how we find our way out.</p>



<blockquote><p>B.</p><p>Surely the time of the soothsayers, who divined what lay hidden in the lap of the future, was experienced neither as homogenous nor as empty. Whoever keeps this in mind will perhaps have an idea of how past time was experienced as remembrance: namely, just the same way. It is well-known that the Jews were forbidden to look into the future. The Torah and the prayers instructed them, by contrast, in remembrance. This disenchanted those who fell prey to the future, who sought advice from the soothsayers. For that reason the future did not, however, turn into a homogenous and empty time for the Jews. For in it every second was the narrow gate, through which the Messiah could enter.</p></blockquote>



<p>What was time like before modernity and the regimented ticking of the clock? In no way did all time have its measurement, homogeneity, or distance — there would only be the memory, or longing of what had been. Holidays to remember, celebrations to be had, and moments of only life to be recounted. The morning differed from the evening, as much as day differed from night; time itself was the precious gem that was life itself. We only have one life which we can live, and we are still waiting with the gate of Law before us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gate is narrow, but it was made for only for our refusal, and only for Mahdi to close, and to welcome the Messiah into the home of the country, the private lives of our hearts.</p>



<p>I Tego Arcana Dei.</p>

<p>This is the modified second half of a longer essay, The Sovereign, the Subject, and Crypto-power: Life in the Digital Panopticon.</p>







<p>Cryptography is first and foremost a technique of war.  </p>



<p>It is the final individual decision to protect one&#8217;s privacy and data beyond any laws, any violence, any war. </p>



<p>The history of computers is the history of cryptanalysis, which in turn is the history of the tactical development of communication under the conditions of total unbracketed war. Asymmetric cryptography is the culmination of the understanding of the phenomenon of “bellum omnium contra omnes” and offers a kind of science to which men can ‘protect themselves, when none else can protect them,’ and most importantly is solidified ‘by no covenant be relinquished.’ (Hobbes ¶ 21.21)</p>



<p>The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of the personal struggle for life, liberty, and wealth against any and all governments that can only be called tyrannical. Bitcoin and the cryptography it entails offers every person a final kind of protection in the field of total unbracketed war where the term “bellum omnium contra omnes” offers its true decrypted meaning: each of us may become homo sacer at anytime for any reason. Nature opens the messianic path through the real state of emergency that is homo homini lupus and the infinite grotesque promise of what that should mean to each and every individual human today, and what Bitcoin offers as a response to it at each step. </p>



<p>Cryptography is the culmination of a cognition of history which recognizes the absolute value and totalizing nature of privacy in the theater of total war of all against all, and the respective role that privity takes in a field of total unbracketed war. In all systems of government, the possibility of a ‘state of emergency [ausnahmezustand]’ that will always create a &#8216;just war [jus bellum justum]&#8217; against ‘other [homo sacer]’ people who can be killed but not sacrificed, exploited but not robbed, and in bondage but not slaves; can always happen, and already is happening. This is a real possibility under any system of law, and is a hideous fact of the legal genocides, ethnic cleansing, and political expropriations of the 20th century. Crypto is a history which understands the infinite violence that all sovereign powers have entitled themselves to for ‘final solution’ of legal means against man, nature, and life as we know it at all cost — including the rule of law itself. </p>



<p>It is once we understand that our political problems are first economic problems that our position in the struggle against global panoptic fascism will vastly improve. It is through this understanding that we will find the only path towards our exit and the freedom that is intended for only us. </p>



The Final Decision of Cryptography



<blockquote><p>“The sovereign is he who decides on the exception.” </p><cite>— Carl Schmitt</cite></blockquote>



<p>Crypto commands the code alone to be sovereign.</p>



<p>There is no exception to this. There are no laws that can change this fact, nor any amount of violence that can modify it either. </p>



<p>Due to this explicit fact that digital expressions exist solely in the realm of  non-physical space through mathematical expression alone, it can never be subjugated to the same physical forces that legal and authoritarian rule must always entail. Crypto leaves no remainder for any kind of exception.</p>



<p>Crypto is subject only to the laws of mathematics alone&#8211;NOT men, institutions, or governments. </p>



<p>If you think otherwise then come and break it!</p>



<p>There is no sovereign exception, nor can there be one. The vicious magnanimity and imperium to which cryptography holds mathematics as its only sacrosant allows for it to consecrate the glory of a singular Spinozian God [Deus sive Natura] to whom there are no exceptions within his machine of mathematics, his immanent laws of the universe, and His passion for a form of common-wealth that is beyond the power of any group of men. Bitcoin is the resounding thunder of an idea whose time has come, and that cannot be stopped.</p>



<blockquote><p>What we need, however, is a political philosophy that isn’t erected around the problem of sovereignty, nor therefore around the problems of law and prohibition. We need to cut off the King’s head: in political theory that has still to be done.</p><cite>&#8211;Foucault, Truth and Power</cite></blockquote>



<p>Crypto presents a political theory which decapitates the sovereign&#8217;s head with the resounding declaration of fiat justitia, et pereat mundus [Let justice be done lest the world perish]. </p>



<p>Crypto does this by not engaging the the classic stratagem of law, prohibition, and sovereignty that all law demands; but something totally novel and new. Crypto engages in a radically new system of common-wealth and digital social contract by using cryptography as the base technique of this new form of organization. Through this a new political form-of-life, where all people can have their wealth be protected from any form of violence through the power of cryptography; a messianic possibility is opened. The crisis of money becomes apocalyptic, and an existential threat to all nation-states today. It is the final emergency that cannot be stopped, and opens humanity to the final epoch where man may take his final dignified place as the ruler of himself, by himself, for himself alone. </p>



<p>This allows for something that all people, everywhere, whether they admit it or not, know in their heart of hearts: that things could be different, that radical economic, social, and political change is a real possibility. We could live not only without hunger, but also probably without fear, and freely as well. And yet, at the same time — and all over the world — the social apparatus has become so hardened and calcified that what lies before us as a means of possible fulfillment presents itself as radically impossible.</p>



<p>Together we must choose to make the collective decision to create the real and final state of emergency that will be the final existential threat to the state and their fiat money. By refusing their corrupt money, hollow laws, and false idols we can make the world new again. Together we can choose to create a new form of social life, common-wealth, and legal system together that is outside and beyond the power of any state or government to destroy&#8211;only for them to submit to. </p>



<p>We can choose to create the foundation for a totally new form of political, social, and economic life that is the commonwealth and new social agreement for our time. With the power of cryptography we can guarantee the privacy, freedom, and liberty that was promised to only us; and that we intend to keep! No fascist decrees, no communist appropriations, no state of emergency from any political banner can stop us! The struggle is real and we will not stop until fiat money is destroyed and the state and money are totally separated as they should to be. </p>



<p>Together we can deactivate fiat money, state law, and shatter the paradise of legal violence and authoritarianism in order to consummate a new form of economic, social, and political life. A life that is beyond the power of any state to destroy, any laws to litigate, and any violence to violated. The state will try to destroy it, and with each blow that they will deliver, crypto will only get stronger. It will prove its inviolable nature more resoundingly, blow by blow, while also showing just how corrupt, wicked, and evil those in positions of legal and state power really are. </p>



<blockquote><p>The sovereign is the point of indistinction between violence and law, the threshold on which violence passes over into law and law passes over into violence.</p><cite>— Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer</cite></blockquote>



<p>Through a glitch in the matrix that creates the image of sovereign power through its physical form; we also find the Achilles’ heel from which there is an opening to create Leviathan’s downfall. Leviathan must always have a physical foothold from where he can display his power, a body to which make an example of his sovereign violence. </p>



<p>However, sovereign power cannot actualize the law if it does not have a physical space to render violence within. It needs a physical body it can identify first, so it may subject, dehumanize and objectify in order to display its legal and physical power. If legal power cannot find a physical body or space in which it can carry out it punishment, it risks displaying the incapacity of the law without violence, the sovereign without his subject, the emperor without clothes.</p>



<p>The secret is that the sovereign is as blind as the rest of us if it cannot see. </p>



Blinding the Sovereign 



<blockquote><p>The State is superstructural in relation to a whole series of power networks, that invest the body, sexuality, the family, kinship, knowledge, technology and so forth. True, these networks stand in a conditioning-conditioned relationship to a kind of ‘meta-power’ which is structured essentially round a certain number of great prohibition functions; but this meta-power with its prohibitions can only take hold and secure its footing where it is rooted in a whole series of multiple and indefinite power relations that supply the necessary basis for the great negative forms of power.&nbsp;</p><cite>&#8211;Foucault, Truth and Power</cite></blockquote>



<p>In order for legal power to secure a footing, the first engagement of power must be one of identification. Through identification, the physical form can be found, and power projected on to the subject in any of the nearly infinite techniques the panopticon can use to project the gaze and its power on the subject. Once identified, the process of selection can begin. The subject can then be labeled as ‘friend’ for inclusion in the camps, or &#8216;enemy&#8217; for isolation, destruction, and liquidation. However, through the digital, which can only and explicitly be expressed in non-physical medium, there is a territory in which the subject can abscond into a total anonymous existence of its own creating. In making the final turn away from the panoptic machine, and giving oneself entirely as anonymous citizen of the digital cosmos, man once again finds the ideals from which he can create the new order of the ages once again.</p>



<p>Through using cryptography to create a novel and fair economic game of wealth common to all, bitcoin rediscovered the sovereign power that is hidden at the center of what a commonwealth really is: The commonality of wealth to all, with no one able to control or change the system for the betterment of some at the cost of others. In other words, it is commonality of law itself, for the system to recognize each of us equally. The capacity and demand for law to remain totally neutral, and blind through the anonymous functions of cryptography ensures complete and open access for everyone. No matter one&#8217;s station of birth, creed of faith, or political identity according to the state; Bitcoin can give you equal access to this new law that is defined by its blockchain. </p>



<p>With this radical new power of peace, man finds himself back at the start of all political concept once again. However, this time man emerges from the forest of technology armed with the final weapon of cryptography and the mask of anonymity of which hides the face of the messianic possibility it contains. Man has renewed the opportunity to liberate himself from the concentration camps of modernity; but this time for good, permanently, and forever.  By using the power of cryptography to banish information from identify, controlling, and subjecting us; we create the new nomos for humanity. </p>



<p>Through bonding our political destinies with with the science of cryptographic protocols and consummating with the machine directly; we can create a new form of common-wealth, law, and power. It is the commonwealth of crypto which will open the next and final epoch for all of humanity and posterity, and what the promise of a money freed from the vestiges of statism, debt, and fiat money looks like. Through the personal choice to totally objectify oneself via code, and giving oneself to it entirely for the protection that it offers when no other sovereign can; the commonwealth of cryptography open the polis to man once again. </p>



<p>Through giving ourselves over to the power of cryptography and the majesty and imperium to which it will always hodl; we find the power to create a real form polis through the encrypted internet. Here we have found the power to open the final hour in which state legal power can be deactivated, and all people may be free from it for good. Peace on this earth is not such a radical ideal if we all have the power/knowledge of cryptography at our fingertips, and how to use such a power to protect our lives, our wealth, our honor, our freedom, and our privacy. </p>



<p>Through accepting crypto as a political cause and sovereign power, any human may free and liberate their wealth, privacy, and liberty from the state and fiat slavery once again. With the true nature of what the common-wealth of law rediscovered, magnus ab integro seclorum nascitur ordo (the great series of ages begins anew). </p>



<p>It is the political and theological destiny of all of humanity in the final hour, the final emergency, for all legal systems to shipwreck themselves on the reef of ethics which no decision can avoid. Each ship designed with the same flaw of the rudder of sovereignty; each one damned to the same mutinied destination no matter the pitch, speed, or weight. We are each free to abandon the ship of the camps now, free to swim back to the country from which we came, where we will no longer be before the law. </p>



<blockquote><p>“One day humanity will play with law just as children play with disused objects, not in order to restore them to their canonical use but to free them from it for good.”</p><cite>— Giorgio Agamben</cite></blockquote>

  &#8220;What does it matter who is speaking,&#8221; someone said, &#8220;what matters is who is speaking.&#8221;



<p>That’s the entire point.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a totally new concept was developed where scientific texts were accepted on their own merits and positioned within an anonymous and coherent conceptual system of established truths and methods of verification. Authentication no<br> longer required reference to the individual who had produced them;<br> the role of the author disappeared as an index of truthfulness and,<br> where it remained as an inventor&#8217;s name, it was merely to denote a<br> specific theorem or proposition, a strange effect, a property, a body, a<br> group of elements, or pathological syndrome.</p><cite>Michel Foucault, What is an Author? [bold mine]</cite></blockquote>



<p>The Spectre that Satoshi Nakamoto represents — a single human being intransigently choosing the protection of cryptography against a seemingly omnipotent global government machine hell-bent on controlling all wealth, information, and identity no matter what — is a far greater power than any money he created; but is the very legend that he and Bitcoin is. Through creating a character that we only know as this amorphous, pseudonymous, nonphysical &#8216;person&#8217;&#8211;the idea that is Satoshi Nakamoto&#8211;and his great work that he introduced into the world&#8211;Bitcoin&#8211;Satoshi was really telling a much greater story about wealth, identity, and power in the arc of human history. When one reads all the details of this hidden story about a man and his passion for a new form of wealth that is beyond any temporal power; we discover the tale of cryptosovereignty and the extraordinary individual power that is cryptography, and Bitcoin in this world. </p>



<p>As time builds between Satoshi&#8217;s last appearance in our world and the inoperetivity that is his task of Bitcoin; so too will the legend of who he is, and the ramification of what he has done. And as this legend grows and becomes known by all of humankind, it will transmogrify beyond just a legend and into the fabric of history itself. As the very foundation of fiat money and panoptic surveillance comes to tremble before the name Satoshi Nakamoto, the reality of his task will be too palpable for anyone to deny. </p>



<p>With each ludicrous attempt to identify Satoshi, as we saw with Dorian, or  the fraudulent, lying, despicable sack of shit that is CSW, or any of those other fuck-ups who have tried to claim to be him; the legend of Satoshi will only grow stronger. Now only a cryptographic signature from the genesis block will suffice to verify that Satoshi is who he is. Anything short of that will always leave space for it to be questioned, for Satoshi to remain hidden. I believe in all of his brilliance and glory Satoshi threw those private keys into the abyss, sealing his fate as the author of the greatest work of art that has ever been created; while dooming his project to the final, inevitable conclusion that it and the world must come to. </p>



<p>For the deepest truth of what Satoshi had to teach us was &#8216;what does it matter who is speaking, someone said, what matters is who is speaking.&#8216; </p>



<p>Through the glory, grace, and dignity of whoever Satoshi Nakamoto may be, the one thing that is for certain is they are of the greatest character and class of any human that there has been. And it is not for the achievement that is Bitcoin, the extraordinary power that is unlocking this new epoch, nor even for the monumental amount of exogenesis wealth it will create; but for his very human choice to walk away. </p>



<p>Through this action alone Satoshi may very well pass himself from being just a legend to something so much more extraordinary and audacious: </p>



<p>Hope.</p>



<p>Real hope. </p>



<p>For something new. For something different. For something fair. </p>



<p>By refusing to reveal who he is, refusing to expose his wealth, and by making the final decision to remain as only the author of Bitcoin, and nothing more; he has moved himself from the human realm into that of the Elysium itself. </p>



<p>By maintaining his image as a Being that is beyond this place of wrath and tears, past the gridding and guilt that is now our very physical faces and existence, and past the shame and injustice that is the history of all fiat money; Satoshi&#8217;s work has opened the narrow path from which we can escape the camps of modren life. Just as in the darkest of nights does the smallest of lights shine the brightest, so too does Bitcoin present itself here on this earth today. </p>



<p>The creation of Bitcoin was a task chosen for only him/them/it alone, and the role was played perfectly to the task. Whoever Satoshi Nakamoto may be, they are clearly the greatest hero of the 21st century, and quite possibility even the great liberator of humanity itself. Only time will tell how great and how vast the legend of Satoshi Nakamoto will grow to be, and how glorious his project of Bitcoin will become; but one thing is for certain and that is this:</p>



<p>Satoshi has given us hope. </p>



<p>By refusing the greatest sum of money that any person has ever created, by keeping his face concealed and beyond the power of any state or person to identify, and by choosing to walk away from one of the most extraordinary project that humanity has ever known; Satoshi has proven his imperium and sovereignty through cryptography.  Through his being as an author alone, he has displayed the power that any of us can have access to when we choose to use the power of cryptography to protect ourselves, and the promise that will always entail. Through his task of Bitcoin and the Good News that it is, he has given each one of us the gift for to choose for ourselves what the real meaning of value, wealth, and law is. </p>



<p>In this final action of walking away, and taking his death upon himself, Satoshi closed the Gate of Law as his final move and checkmate to forbid any state from interloping in our land, and allow us an opportunity to abscond back to the country from which we came so we may be free once again. </p>







<p>Epilogue:</p>



<p>It is said that after Satoshi stopped working on Bitcoin that he found a job as a scrivener lost somewhere down on Wall Street. Today he still sits there, as Bartleby once did, confounding financiers, economist, lawyers, and all sorts of reasonable men alike with his intransigency, and decision to refuse to go along with anything. It is said that he was a most unreasonable man and his only response to any question was:</p>



&#8220;I would prefer not to.&#8221;







<blockquote><p>“If Bartleby is a new Messiah, he comes not, like Jesus, to redeem what was, but to save what was not. The Tartarus into which Bartleby, the new savior, descends is the deepest level of the Palace of Destinies, that whose sight Leibniz cannot tolerate, the world in which nothing is compossible with anything else, where &#8220;nothing exists rather than something.”</p><cite>― Giorgio Agamben</cite></blockquote>
